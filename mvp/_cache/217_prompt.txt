Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Monthly Database for Macroeconomic Research

From original website:
-----
FRED-MD and FRED-QD are large macroeconomic databases designed for the empirical analysis of 'big data'. The datasets of monthly and quarterly observations mimic the coverage of datasets already used in the literature, but they add three appealing features. They are updated in real-time through the FRED database. They are publicly accessible, facilitating the replication of empirical work. And they relieve the researcher of the task of incorporating data changes and revisions (a task accomplished by the data desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).

The accompanying papers shows that factors extracted from the FRED-MD and FRED-QD datasets share comparable information content to various vintages of so-called Stock-Watson datasets. These factor estimates are shown to be useful for forecasting a wide range of macroeconomic series. In addition, we find that diffusion indexes constructed as the partial sum of the factor estimates can potentially be useful for the study of business cycle chronology.

We used the file 2024-05.csv for monthly data and performed some preprocessing.

There are 119 columns:

M3-Competition for time series forecasting, other data

From original source:
-----
The 3003 series of the M3-Competition were selected on a quota basis to include various types of time series data (micro, industry, macro, etc.) 
and different time intervals between successive observations (yearly, quarterly, etc.). In order to ensure that enough data were available to 
develop an adequate forecasting model it was decided to have a minimum number of observations for each type of data.
This minimum was set as 14 observations for yearly series (the median length for the 645 yearly series is 19 observations), 
16 for quarterly (the median length for the 756 quarterly series is 44 observations), 48 for monthly (the median length for the 1428 monthly
series is 115 observations) and 60 for 'other' series (the median length for the 174 'other' series is 63 observations). Table 1 shows the
classification of the 3003 series according to the two major groupings described above. All the time series data are strictly positive; a test
has been done on all the forecasted values: in the case of

Competition Data Format

Data file containing time series to be predicted is a text file having the following format:

Each row contains a single time series data record;

items in the row are delimited with semicolon (";");

the first item is an ID of the time series;

the second item determines the forecasting horizon, i.e., the number of values to be forecasted;

the third item determines the frequency of the time series (this year "monthly" only);

the rest of the row contains numeric data of the time series;

the number of values in each row may differ because each time series is of different length.

Example of the competition data format:

ts1;4;yearly;26.5;38.2;5.3
ts2;12;monthly;1;2;4;5;5;6;8;9;10
...
ts72;12;daily;1;2;4;5;5;6;8;9;10
