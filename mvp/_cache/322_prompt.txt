Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Name: Water-Capture-by-Method

Tags: 

Context
Though it doesn't rain often in Los Angeles, the city has various means of capturing rainfall to increase our local water supply. This dataset shows how much water we've capturing cumulatively this season as well as today. 
Content
Each row in this dataset corresponds to a datetime at which a measurement was made. Measurements include water captured in rain barrels and cisterns, incidental capture, green infrastructure capture, etc. For more details, click the "Data" tab of this dataset.
Methods
This dataset was created using Kaggle's API from this dataset on the City of LA's open data portal:
curl -o los_angeles_water_capture.csv https://data.lacity.org/resource/bnhe-q7a5.csv
kaggle datasets init -p .
kaggle datasets create -p .

How much does it rain in Los Angeles?
Where does the most rain capture come from?

Name: Moonrise-Moonset--Phases-Timings-(UK-2005-2017)

Tags: 

This dataset contains moonrise, moonset and lunar phase timings for every date from 2005 to 2017 for London, UK*; collected from timeanddate.
Inspiration
This data can be used to study the effects of lunar cycle on any other event of interest. One interesting application for which I made it is to find the correlation of full moon timings with road accidents, to test the Lunar Lunacy effect!  
I'm eager to see what other creative uses it can have?!

*Note: Since only one city can be chosen to retrieve results from the source, hence I have to use London in UK as geographical location. It's noteworthy that moonrise and moonset times will differ for different locations in UK, despite of same timezone due to differences in solar time (in simple words, differences in horizon level). Yet these differences in timings will still be lesser than 30 min (as per observing the contrast between that of eastern and western locations of UK). So if precise timing is not required, then these timings can be used to account for entire UK. And technically, the primary Moon phases occur at a specific

Name: Boston-Weather-Data-Jan-2013---Apr-2018

Tags: 

Having just moved to Boston last fall, I wanted to know whether the severe winter weather I experienced was normal based on historical data, or if there are any patterns to when Boston gets heavy snowfall and wind.
Dataset contains highs, lows, and averages of temperature, dew point, wind speeds, sea level pressure, and precipitation levels for every day from 1/1/2013 - 4/8/2018 inclusive. All data is publicly available in its entirety on the Weather Underground website - this is a collation of data over several years, that is difficult to see all at once on the Weather Underground site. I simply cleaned up the data by breaking out the month and year into their own columns and condensing the column headers.
All data can be found here: https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBOS/2018/1/1/DailyHistory.html?reqdb.zip=reqdb.magic=reqdb.wmo= 
It would be interesting to see this weather data compared with weather data from other locations to see if there are any corresponding patterns. Feel free to augment this dataset if you need more updated information

Remember, generate many themes and overarching themes, each one should be used in the classifications (don't skip any of the generated themes and overarching themes), then classify each dataset id by them, make sure to return for each dataset ID - 43713, 43487, 43583, 43559, 43335, 43623 !
