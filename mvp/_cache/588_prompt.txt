Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:
ID: 506

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Name: sarcos

**Dataset Description**

The data relates to an inverse dynamics problem for a seven degrees-of-freedom
SARCOS anthropomorphic robot arm. The task is to map from a 21-dimensional
input space (7 joint positions, 7 joint velocities, 7 joint accelerations) to
the corresponding 7 joint torques. Usually, the first of those (V22) is used as
the target variable and is therefore set as the default target variable, while
the other 6 joint torques are excluded from the model.


**NOTE**

This dataset contains only the corresponding training data, as there is data leakage between
the original training and test data. This was described in
[this article](https://www.datarobot.com/blog/running-code-and-failing-models/) by Rajiv Shah.

**Data Description**

Within robotics, inverse dynamics algorithms are used to calculate the torques that a robot's motors must deliver to make the robot's end-point move in the way prescribed by its current task. More about [inverse dynamics][1].

[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_dynamics>

The data set consists of 45,000 data points, collected at 100Hz from the actual robot performing various rhythmic and discrete movement tasks (this corresponds to 7.5 minutes of data collection).

The task is to map from a 21-dimensional input space (7 joint positions, 7 joint velocities, 7 joint accelerations) to the corresponding 7 joint torques.

**Attribute Description**

1. *V[1-7]* - 7 joint positions
2. *V[8-14]* - 7 joint velocities
3. *V[15-21]* - 7 joint accelerations
4. *V[22-28]* - 7 joint torques, target variables, take one (*V22*) as target feature, ignore others as alternate target features

Features: V1, V2, V3, V4,

Name: Grasping-Dataset

Context
At Shadow Robot, we are leaders in robotic grasping and manipulation. As part of our Smart Grasping System development, we're developing different algorithms using machine learning. 
This first public dataset was created to investigate the use of machine learning to predict the stability of a grasp. Due to the limitations of the current simulation, it is a restricted dataset - only grasping a ball. The dataset is annotated with an objective grasp quality and contains the different data gathered from the joints (position, velocity, effort).
You can find all the explanations for this dataset over on Medium.
Inspiration
I'll be more than happy to discuss this dataset as well as which dataset you'd like to have to try your hands at solving real world robotic problems focused on grasping using machine learning. Let's connect on twitter (ugocupcic)!

Features: experiment_number, _robustness, _H1_F1J2_pos_, _H1_F1J2_vel_, _H1_F1J2_eff_, _H1_F1J3_pos_, _H1_F1J3_vel_, _H1_F1J3_eff_, _H1_F1J1_pos_, _

Remember, generate many themes and overarching themes, each one should be used in the classifications (don't skip any of the generated themes and overarching themes), then classify each dataset id by them, make sure to return for each dataset ID - 44968, 43873, 44976, 43708 !
