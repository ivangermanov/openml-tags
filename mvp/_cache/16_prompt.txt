Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Grass Grubs and Damage Ranking

Data source:   R. J. Townsend
AgResearch, Lincoln, New Zealand

Grass grubs are one of the major insect pests of pasture in Canterbury and  can cause severe pasture damage and economic loss. Pastoral damage may occur periodically over wide ranging areas. Grass grub populations are often influenced by biotic factors (diseases) and farming practices (such as irrigation and heavy rolling). The objective of the report was to report on grass grub population and damage levels to provide objective estimates of the annual losses caused by grass grubs.

The original machine learning objective was to find a relationship between grass grub numbers, irrigation and damage ranking for the period between 1986 to 1992.

White Clover Persistence Trials

Data source:   Ian Tarbotton
AgResearch, Whatawhata Research Centre, Hamilton, New Zealand

The objective was to determine the mechanisms which influence the persistence of white clover populations in summer dry hill land. In particular reference to the consequence of a severe summer dry period in 1993/1994 and how it impacted on the performance of three white clover cultivars in an on-going experiment located at Whatawhata Research Centre.

The machine learning objective was to predict the amount of white clover in 1994 from the amount of white clover and other species in the years 1991 to 1994 as well as information on the 'strata' where the white clover was being grown.

Attribute Information:
1.  strata - enumerated
2.  plot - enumerated
3.  paddock - enumerated

**Eucalyptus Soil Conservation**  
The objective was to determine which seedlots in a species are best for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. Determination is found by measurement of height, diameter by height, survival, and other contributing factors. 
 
It is important to note that eucalypt trial methods changed over time; earlier trials included mostly 15 - 30cm tall seedling grown in peat plots and the later trials have included mostly three replications of eight trees grown. This change may contribute to less significant results.

Experimental data recording procedures which require noting include:

Pasture Production

Data source:   Dave Barker
AgResearch Grasslands, Palmerston North, New Zealand

The objective was to predict pasture production from a variety of biophysical factors. Vegetation and soil variables from areas of grazed North Island hill country with different management (fertilizer application/stocking rate) histories (1973-1994) were measured and subdivided into 36 paddocks. Nineteen vegetation (including herbage production); soil chemical, physical and biological; and soil water variables were selected as potentially useful biophysical indicators.

1.  fertiliser - fertiliser used - enumerated
2.  slope - slope of the paddock - integer
