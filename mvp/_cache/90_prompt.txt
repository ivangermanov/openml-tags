Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

87 persons with lupus nephritis. Followed up 15+ years. 35 deaths. Var =
duration of disease. Over 40 baseline variables avaiable from authors.
Description :
For description of this data set arising from 87 persons
with lupus nephritis followed for 15+ years after an initial
renal biopsy (the starting point of follow-up) see the introduction to
Abrahamowicz, MacKenzie and Esdaile (December 1996 issue).
This data set only contains time to death/censoring, indicator,
duration and log(1+duration), where duration is the duration
of untreated  disease prior to biopsy. This variable was the
focus in the aforementioned JASA article because it clearly
violates the proportionality of hazards assumption. More than
40 other variables acquired at baseline are available from
authors.

 in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 
 1984.  A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during
 that ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo 
 controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the data 
 set participated in the randomized trial, and contain largely complete data. 
 The additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical trial, but

 NAME:  Sexual activity and the lifespan of male fruitflies
 TYPE:  Designed (almost factorial) experiment
 SIZE:  125 observations, 5 variables
 
 DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
 A cost of increased reproduction in terms of reduced longevity has been
 shown for female fruitflies, but not for males.  The flies used were an
 outbred stock.  Sexual activity was manipulated by supplying individual
 males with one or eight receptive virgin females per day.  The
 longevity of these males was compared with that of two control types.
 The first control consisted of two sets of individual males kept with
 one or eight newly inseminated females.  Newly inseminated females will
 not usually remate for at least two days, and thus served as a control
 for any effect of competition with the male for food or space.  The
 second control was a set of individual males kept with no females.
 There were 25 males in each of the five groups, which were treated
 identically in number of anaest
