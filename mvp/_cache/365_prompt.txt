Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Name: FitBit_HeartRate

Tags: 

Description:
The 'heartrate_seconds_merged.csv' dataset is a comprehensive compilation of heart rate measurements collected over varying days and times, intended to provide insights into heart rate variability across different individuals and time periods. The dataset is structured into three primary columns: 'Id', 'Time', and 'Value'. 

Attribute Description:
- 'Id': This column contains unique numerical identifiers (e.g., 4020332650, 6962181067) for each participant in the study, allowing for the anonymized tracking of heart rate data across multiple entries.
- 'Time': Each entry in this column records the specific date and time when the heart rate measurement was taken, formatted as 'Month/Day/Year Hours:Minutes:Seconds AM/PM' (e.g., '4/5/2016 8:00:15 AM'). This attribute is crucial for understanding the temporal context of each heart rate measurement.
- 'Value': Represents the heart rate of an individual at the recorded time, measured in beats per minute (BPM). Sample values in this dataset range from 55 to 92 BPM, indicating the variability of heart rate measurements among different times and individuals.

Name: FitBit_Sleep

Tags: 

Description:
The dataset named "minuteSleep_merged.csv" captures detailed sleep tracking information, segmented into one-minute intervals, for a group of users. It consists of several key attributes that enable a comprehensive analysis of sleep patterns over time.

Attribute Description:
- Id: A unique numeric identifier for each user in the dataset. Example values include 8378563200 and 4319703577, indicating distinct participants.
- date: The specific date and time when the sleep data was recorded, formatted as MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM. Sample entries, such as '4/5/2016 3:56:30 AM', represent when a user was detected as sleeping.
- value: A binary indicator showing whether the user was asleep (1) or awake (0) during the given minute. Most entries are '1', denoting a minute spent asleep.
- logId: A unique identifier for each sleep log entry. This number is critical for distinguishing between different sleep sessions for the same user. Examples include 11304567341 and 11327738294.

Use Case:
This dataset is invaluable for research in several areas, including sleep studies, healthcare analytics

Content
All data was collected via my Garmin GPS watch and uploaded to Garmin Connect via Bluetooth. There are gaps in my log, the largest being from summer of 2019 to about spring 2020 (I ran competitively in college and took a break when I graduated in 2019). My GPS also has a wrist heart rate monitor, although it isn't always accurate. Similarly, occasionally the GPS had some inaccuracies as well, though subjectively I felt this occurred less frequently.
Acknowledgements
Thank you to Garmin Connect for making it easy to export this data and to my legs.

Based on my training log data, can you estimate my "fitness" as a function of time? Specifically, when was my fitness maximized? I have a record of when I ran all of my PRs (personal records), so that could be a good way to check if you are right.
