Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Name: Thyroid_Disease

Tags: 

Description:
The "Thyroid_Diff.csv" dataset is a comprehensive collection of clinical data relating to thyroid diseases. With attributes capturing a wide range of information from patient demographics (age, gender) to specific clinical findings (smoking history, radiotherapy history, thyroid function, physical examination findings), it provides a detailed overview of patients diagnosed with various forms of thyroid conditions. The dataset encapsulates aspects such as the presence of adenopathy, pathology findings, focality of the disease, and risk categorization. Further, it delves into the TNM classification system, providing insights into the size and extent of tumors (T), presence of cancer in nearby lymph nodes (N), and metastasis (M), thereby contributing to the staging of the disease. The clinical response to treatment and recurrence status is also recorded, offering valuable data for outcomes analysis.

Attribute Description:
- Age: Numeric, represents the age of the patient.
- Gender: Categorical, 'M' for male, 'F' for female.
- Smoking: Binary, 'Yes' if the patient has a history of smoking, 'No' otherwise.
- Hx Smoking: Binary, indicating a historical record of smoking.

General Description of Thyroid Disease Databases 
                        and Related Files

This directory contains 6 databases, corresponding test set, and 
corresponding documentation.  They were left at the University of
California at Irvine by Ross Quinlan during his visit in 1987 for
the 1987 Machine Learning Workshop.  

The documentation files (with file extension &quot;names&quot;) are formatted to
be read by Quinlan's C4 decision tree program.  Though briefer than
the other documentation files found in this database repository, they
should suffice to describe the database, specifically:

    1. Source
    2. Number and names of attributes (including class names)
    3. Types of values that each attribute takes

In general, these databases are quite similar and can be characterized
somewhat as follows:

    1. Many attributes (29 or so, mostly the same set over all the databases)
    2. mostly numeric or Boolean valued attributes
    3. thyroid disease domains (records provided by the Garavan Institute

This directory contains Thyroid datasets. &quot;ann-train.data&quot; contains 3772 
learning examples and &quot;ann-test.data&quot; contains 3428 testing examples. I have 
obtained this data from Daimler-Benz. This are the informations I have got 
together with the dataset:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Data setp summary

Number of attributes: 21 (15 attributes are binary,
      6 attributes are continuous)
Number of classes: 3
Number of learning examples: 3772
Number of testing examples: 3428
Data set is availbale on ASCII-file

2. Description

The problem is to determine whether a patient referred to the clinic is
hypothyroid. Therefore three classes are built: normal (not hypothyroid),
hyperfunction and subnormal functioning. Because 92 percent of the patients
are not hyperthyroid a good classifier must be significant better than 92%.

Note

These are the datas Quinlans used in the case study of his article
&quot;Simplifying Decision Trees&quot; (International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 
(1987) 221-234)
