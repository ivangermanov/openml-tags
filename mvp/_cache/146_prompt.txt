Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

**Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame database**  
This database encodes the complete set of possible board configurations at the end of tic-tac-toe games, where "x" is assumed to have played first.  The target concept is "win for x" (i.e., true when "x" has one of 8 possible ways to create a "three-in-a-row").

The objective of this dataset is to create a chess engine through machine learning. In this first part we will first predict the pieces to be moved depending on the position of the chessboard
This is inspired by this research (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/28a9/fff7208256de548c273e96487d750137c31d.pdf) but by comparing several approaches and having the best performance

Content
The players are represented by the winning player and the losing player.
The first 64 columns represent the 64 squares of the chessboard and each value corresponds to the piece which is on this square
the unique values are as follows

WR: Rook of wining player
WB: Bishop of wining player
WN: Knight of wining player
WQ: Queen of wining player

Abstract:

A chess endgame data set representing the positions on the board of the white king, the white rook, and the black king. The task is to determine the optimum number of turn required for white to win the game, which can be a draw if it takes more than sixteen turns.

Klaverjas is an example of the Jack-Nine card games, which are characterized as trick-taking games where the the Jack and nine of the trump suit are the highest-ranking trumps, and the tens and aces of other suits are the most valuable cards of these suits. It is played by four players in two teams. 

This dataset contains the game-theoretic value of almost a million configurations, given perfect play by both teams. It is assumed that player 0 starts and that the Diamondsuit is trump. Each of the configurations comes from a different equivalence class. Although the game theoretic value (expressedin the score difference between two teams) constitutes a regression problem, in the attached publication we viewed this as a classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether the

Context
This data is the result of using neural networks and reinforcement learning to simulate the board game "Machi Koro". 
Here is the source code for the AI and simulation: https://github.com/mcandocia/machi_ai
Content
Each row is a single turn in a game, corresponding to the state at the beginning of the turn, and there are 10,000 games total. There are 4 players, so all columns except for gameid and turnid reference a specific player. Each player takes turns performing actions, which can involve gaining coins, losing coins to other players, building properties, stealing coins from other players, and possibly switching properties with another player. The results of each turn largely depend on a single or double dice-roll.
The goal of the game is to build four specific properties, which are represented by the variables pXstation, pXshoppingmall, pXamusementpark, pXradio_tower, where X represents the player who owns it.
Variables:
gameid - ID of the game being played
turnid - Turn number of the game. An additional turn is added at the end of each game
