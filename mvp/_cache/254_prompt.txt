Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark https://github.com/LeoGrin/tabular-benchmark,  
                                  transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on categorical and
                                  numerical features" benchmark. Original description: 
 
Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include, for example, the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium car makers. Daimler's Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.

To ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler's engineers have developed a robust testing system. But, optimizing the speed of their testing system for so many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. As one of the world's biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Daimler's production lines

Auto MPG (6 variables) dataset

The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon (Mpg), to be predicted in terms of 1 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes (two multivalued discrete attributes (Cylinders and Origin) from the original dataset (autoMPG6) are removed).

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute Mpg, 6 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the Mpg attribute.

Features: Displacement, Horse_power, Weight, Acceleration, Model_year, Mpg

The Committee on Statistical Graphics of the American Statistical
Association (ASA) invites you to participate in its Second (1983)
Exposition of Statistical Graphics Technology. The purposes of the
Exposition are (l) to provide a forum in which users and providers of
statistical graphics technology can exchange information and ideas and
(2) to expose those members of the ASA community who are less familiar
with statistical graphics to its capabilities and potential benefits
to them. The Exposition wil1 be held in conjunction with the Annual
Meetings in Toronto, August 15-18, 1983 and is tentatively scheduled
for the afternoon of Wednesday, August 17.

Seven providers of statistical graphics technology participated in the
l982 Exposition. By all accounts, the Exposition was well received by
the ASA community and was a worthwhile experience for the
participants. We hope to have those seven involved again this year,
along with as many new participants as we can muster. The 1982
Exposition was summarized in a paper to appear

The data comprises the brand, type and model. For each car we have information about the cubic capacity (in cm3), the maximal power of engine (in kW), the maximal torque (in Nm), the number of seats, the weight of the car (in kg), the maximum engine speed (in rpm), the acceleration from 0 to 100km/h (in seconds), and the top speed (in km/h). In addition if the car is classified as a sports car (binary) and the tau value (see article).

This data is based on the data from the article &ldquo;What is a sports car&rdquo; by Ingenbleek&ndash;Lemaire (1988, ASTIN Bulletin 18/2, 175-187.). Unfortunately, only part of the original data set is still available. Therefore, it has been extended with additional cars which have been compiled from the internet.

The dataset was kindly created and provided by Simon Rentzmann and Mario V. Wuthrich.
