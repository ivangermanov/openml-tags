Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:
ID: 506

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Entirely derived from web-scraping Zomato Chennai page. The data has important columns like the price for 2, top-selling dishes and cuisines the restaurant serve. It also has Zomato given ratings and how many votes were used to come up with that rating. Any field which I was unable to scrape is given as 'invalid'
Acknowledgements
All of the data belongs to Zomato and Zomato only. I thank Zomato for their ever helpful website. This data should be used only for academic purposes

About this file
What are the things that a potential home buyer considers before purchasing a house? The location, the size of the property, vicinity to offices, schools, parks, restaurants, hospitals or the stereotypical white picket fence? What about the most important factor - the price?

Now with the lingering impact of demonetization, the enforcement of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), and the lack of trust in property developers in the city, housing units sold across India in 2017 dropped by 7 percent. In fact, the property prices in Bengaluru fell by almost 5 percent in the second half of 2017, said a study published by property consultancy Knight Frank.
For example, for a potential homeowner, over 9,000 apartment projects and flats for sale are available in the range of 42-52 lakh, followed by over 7,100 apartments that are in the 52-62 lakh budget segment, says a report by property website Makaan. According to the study, there are over 5,000 projects in the 15-25 lakh budget segment followed by those in the

Name: Govt.-of-India-Census-2001-District-Wise

Tags: 

Context
Census of India is a rich database which can tell stories of over a billion Indians. It is important not only for research point of view, but commercially as well for the organizations that want to understand India's complex yet strongly knitted heterogeneity. 
However, nowhere on the web, there exists a single database that combines the district- wise information of all the variables (most include no more than 4-5 out of over 50 variables!). Extracting and using data from Census of India 2001 is quite a laborious task since all data is made available in scattered PDFs district wise. Individual PDFs can be extracted from http://www.censusindia.gov.in/(S(ogvuk1y2e5sueoyc5eyc0g55))/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx. 
Content
This database has been extracted from Census of 2001 and includes data of 590 districts, having around 80 variables each. 
In case of confusion regarding the context of the variable, refer to the following PDF and you will be able to make sense out of it: http://censusindia
