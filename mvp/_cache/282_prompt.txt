Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:
ID: 506

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

Context
Retail dataset of a global superstore for 4 years.
Perform EDA and Predict the sales of the next 7 days from the last date of the Training dataset!

Content
Time series analysis deals with time series based data to extract patterns for predictions and other characteristics of the data. It uses a model for forecasting future values in a small time frame based on previous observations. It is widely used for non-stationary data, such as economic data, weather data, stock prices, and retail sales forecasting.

Dataset
The dataset is easy to understand and is self-explanatory

Name: Cinema-Tickets

Tags: 

Context
Cinema industry is not excluded of getting advantage of predictive modeling. Like other industry it
can help cinemas for cost reduction and better ROI. By forecasting sale,  screening in different location could be optimized as well as effective market targeting and pricing. 
Also historical data of sale and movies details e.g. cost, cast and crews, and other project details like schedule,  could help producers to select high performance cast and crews and planning for better projects  ROI . Also it helps to assign  screening location  on hot spots and areas.

About
This dataset is based on https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset 
Historical sales data covers the period from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Sales and Features data was merged, Weekly sales were estimated at total store level, and only data for Store = 20 was selected.
Columns

Date - the week
Temperature - average temperature in the region
Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region
- MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA
CPI - the consumer price index
Unemployment - the unemployment rate
IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week
Weekly_Sales -  sales in the given date (week)

The original dataset was obtained here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset

Name: Historical_Product_Demand

Tags: 

Source: Charles Gaydon
This data only contains 5 variables of Productcode, Warehouse, ProductCategory, Date, Order_demand
I showed that it is possible, with trivial models, to lower the mean average forecasting error to only around 20 in terms of volume of command, this for 80 of the total volume ordered. This should prove that there is a predicting potential in this dataset that only waits to be exploited.
Again, I the reader wants to continue this work, he or she should use only a selection of the past months to make the forecast.
Other ideas for further development :
-- use warehouse and category data in the model;
-- predict normalized categories of order command (ex: 0 - 1 to 20 - - 100 to 120; where 100 is the historical max of a product) and use a classifier instead of a linear model.
-- check for AIC, BIC,  AICc scores.
