Based on the below information, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. "Music", "Sports", "Environment", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. "Tennis" rather than "Tennis Match", "Prison" rather than "Prison Time", etc., however, if the term makes sense only as a whole, e.g. "Republic of the Congo", "COVID-19", then use it! Consider adding synonyms as well, e.g. for "Influenza", add "Flu", for "Car", add "Automobile", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   "Agriculture", "Astronomy", "Chemistry", "Computational Universe", "Computer Systems", "Climate and Environment", "Culture", "Demographics", "Earth Science", "Economics", "Education", "Engineering", "Finance", "Geography", "Government", "Games", "Health", "History", "Human Activities", "Images", "Language", "Law", "Life Science", "Machine Learning", "Manufacturing", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Meteorology", "Physical Sciences", "Politics", "Social Media", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Text & Literature",  "Transportation". Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. "Serine Threonine Protein Kinase". Good theme examples are: "Birds", "Species Migration", "Air Pollution", or "War", "Government", "International Relations", "Politics". And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of "Income Prediction", say "Income", instead of "Demographic Information", say "Demographics"! Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction, if they exist. Say {"topic": {"themes": ["example1", "example2", ...], "overarching_themes": ["example13", "...", ...]}, "texts": [{"example1": 0.93, "example2": 0.68, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 1, all of them)}], {"example1": 0.87, "example2": 0.34, "...": ..., ..., "example13": ..., ... (strings corresponding to themes and overarching themes for text 2, all of them)}]} and give your answer in JSON format, where under "topic" you put all themes and overarching themes, and in "texts", you give a confidence score in each theme and overarching theme for each text. "themes" and "overarching_themes" shouldn't overlap. If a theme is overarching and common to all texts, it should be present in all texts with a high score. Give only the ones with highest scores.
For example, for this text:
ID: 506

Name: Biden Administration

The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid.

White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two other sources familiar with those conversations said.

For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.

Name: Name: Trump conviction

Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president?

Definitely.

Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.

Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee.

It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time.

Name: Trump has vowed to give green cards to college grads. Could that actually happen?

The candidate known for touting immigration crackdowns told a group of tech investors that he wanted to help foreign students stay in the US.

“What I want to do, and what I will do, is — you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a June interview with “The All-In Podcast.”

If the president-elect pursues this proposal after he takes office, and if Congress passes the legislation that would be required to enact it, the policy could pave the way for potentially millions of international students to become legal permanent residents.

- ID: 572

Name: bank8FM

**Author**:   
**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  
**Please cite**:   

A family of datasets synthetically generated from a simulation of how bank-customers choose their banks. Tasks are
based on predicting the fraction of bank customers who leave the bank because of full queues. The bank family of
datasets are generated from a simplistic simulator, which simulates the queues in a series of banks. The simulator was
constructed with the explicit purpose of generating a family of datasets for DELVE. Customers come from several
residential areas, choose their preferred bank depending on distances and have tasks of varying complexity, and various
levels of patience. Each bank has several queues, that open and close according to demand. The tellers have various
effectivities, and customers may change queue, if their patience expires. In the rej prototasks, the object is to predict the
rate of rejections, ie the fraction of customers that are turned away from the bank because all the open tellers have full
queues.

**Data Description**

A realistic simulation of the forward dynamics of an 8 link all-revolute robot arm. The task in all datasets is to predict the distance of the end-effector from a target. The input are the angular positions of the joints. The task is medium noisy and nonlinear.

Each instance represents a configuration of angular positions of the joints and the resulting distance of the end-effector from a target.

**Attribute Description**

1. *theta[1-8]* - angular positions of the joints
2. *y* - resulting distance of end-effector from target, target feature

Features: theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6, theta7, theta8, y

This is one of a family of datasets synthetically generated from a realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Unimation Puma 560 robot arm. There are eight datastets in this family . In this repository we only have two of them. They are all variations on the same model; a realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Puma 560 robot arm. The task in these datasets is to predict the angular accelaration of one of the robot arm's links. The inputs include angular positions, velocities and torques of the robot arm. The family has been specifically generated for the delve environment and so the individual datasets span the corners of a cube whose dimensions represent:

Number of inputs 32 
degree of non-linearity (fairly linear or non-linear) 
amount of noise in the output (moderate or high).
