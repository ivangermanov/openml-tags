Altay Guvenir: \"The aim is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to classify it in one of the 16 groups. Class 01 refers to 'normal' ECG classes 02 to 15 refers to different classes of arrhythmia and class 16 refers to the rest of unclassified ones. For the time being, there exists a computer program that makes such a classification. However there are differences between the cardiolog's and the programs classification. Taking the cardiolog's as a gold standard we aim to minimise this difference by means of machine learning tools.\"\n\nThe names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.

The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of 20,000 unique stimuli.  Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.

Each line in the dataset constitutes the record of a single male individual.\n\nImportant note: The 7th field (selector) has been widely misinterpreted in the past as a dependent variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. This is incorrect [1]. The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector. It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification. The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval) and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification: Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising, as a dependent variable for classification.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars.  The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this process \"symboling\".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.\n\nThe third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family. The model was developed within expert system shell for decision making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).\n\nThe hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure:\n\n NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools\n . EMPLOY           Employment of parents and child's nursery\n . . parents        Parents' occupation\n . . has_nurs       Child's nursery\n . STRUCT_FINAN     Family structure and financial standings\n . . STRUCTURE      Family structure\n . . . form         Form of the family\n . . . children     Number of children\n . . housing        Housing conditions\n . . finance        Financial standing of the family\n . SOC_HEALTH       Social and health picture of the family\n . . social         Social conditions\n . . health         Health conditions\n\nInput attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (NURSERY) the model includes four intermediate concepts: EMPLOY, STRUCT_FINAN, STRUCTURE, SOC_HEALTH. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/nursery.html).\n\nThe Nursery Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates NURSERY to the eight input attributes: parents, has_nurs, form, children, housing, finance, social, health.\n\nBecause of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

The integration aperture for higher frequencies occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during the chirp.\n\nThe label associated with each record contains the letter \"R\" if the object is a rock and \"M\" if it is a mine (metal cylinder).

Emails Additional Information The \"spam\" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...\n\nThe classification task for this dataset is to determine whether a given email is spam or not.\n\t\nOur collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.\n\nFor background on spam: Cranor, Lorrie F., LaMacchia, Brian A.  Spam!, Communications of the ACM, 41(8):74-83, 1998.\n\nTypical performance is around ~7% misclassification error. False positives (marking good mail as spam) are very undesirable.If we insist on zero false positives in the training/testing set, 20-25% of the spam passed through the filter.

Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occuring in the e-mail.  The run-length attributes (55-57) measure the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters.  For the statistical measures of each attribute, see the end of this file.  Here are the definitions of the attributes:\n\n48 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type word_freq_WORD \n= percentage of words in the e-mail that match WORD, i.e. 100 * (number of times the WORD appears in the e-mail) / total number of words in e-mail.  A \"word\" in this case is any string of alphanumeric characters bounded by non-alphanumeric characters or end-of-string.\n\n6 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type char_freq_CHAR] \n= percentage of characters in the e-mail that match CHAR, i.e. 100 * (number of CHAR occurences) / total characters in e-mail\n\n1 continuous real [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_average \n= average length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters\n\n1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_longest \n= length of longest uninterrupted sequence of capital letters\n\n1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total \n= sum of length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters \n= total number of capital letters in the e-mail\n\n1 nominal {0,1} class attribute of type spam\n= denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail."

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle, using  a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.  \n\nHISTORY:\n\nThis data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction.\n\nThis object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\n\nThe rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped similar object views into single decisions.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.\n\nFour \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.\n\nThe images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\n\nThe vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.\n\n A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations. Has Missing Values? No",

However, they represent so called \"boundary\" values; according to these \"boundary\" values the attribute can be discretized. At the same time, because of the continious attribute, one can perform some other test since the continuous information is preserved. I hope that these lines have at least roughly answered your question."

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.\n\nThe Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach.\n\nOne frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.\n\nThe database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes:\n\nNumber\t\t\tClass\n1\t\t\tred soil\n2\t\t\tcotton crop\n3\t\t\tgrey soil\n4\t\t\tdamp grey soil\n5\t\t\tsoil with vegetation stubble\n6\t\t\tmixture class (all types present)\n7\t\t\tvery damp grey soil\n\t\nNB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.\n\nThe data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.\n\nIn each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary. Has Missing Values? No",

In each frame, the centroid pixels of the segmented objects (the hand) are found, which \ncompose the discrete version of the curve F with 45 points. All curves are normalized in the unitary space.\n\nIn order to prepare these movements to be analysed by algorithms, we have carried out a mapping operation, that is, each\ncurve F is mapped in a representation with 90 features, with representing the coordinates of movement. \n\nSome sub-datasets are offered in order to support comparisons of results.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information The Infra-Red Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the first attempt to map the full sky at infra-red wavelengths.  This could not be done from ground observatories because large portions of the infra-red spectrum is absorbed by the atmosphere.  The primary observing program was the full high resolution sky mapping performed by scanning at 4 frequencies. The Low Resolution Observation (IRAS-LRS) program observed high intensity sources over two continuous spectral bands.  This database derives from a subset of the higher quality LRS observations taken between 12h and 24h right ascension. \n\nThis database contains 531 high quality spectra derived from the IRAS-LRS database.  The original data contained 100 spectral measurements in each of two overlapping bands.  Of these, 44 blue band and 49 red band channels contain usable flux measurements.  Only these are included here.  The original spectral intensities values are compressed to 4-digits, and each spectrum includes 5 rescaling parameters.  We have used the LRS specified algorithm to rescale these to units of spectral intensity (Janskys).  Total intensity differences have been eliminated by normalizing each spectrum to a mean value of 5000.\n\t\nThis database was originally obtained for use in development and testing of our AutoClass system for Bayesian classification.  We have not retained any results from this development, having concentrated our efforts of a 5425 element version of the same data.  Our classifications were based upon simultaneous modeling of all 93 spectral intensities. With the larger database we were able to find classes that correspond well with known spectral types associated with particular stellar types. We also found classes that match with the spectra expected of certain stellar processes under investigation by Ames astronomers.  These classes have considerably enlarged the set of stars being investigated by those researchers.  \n\nOriginal Data:\n\nThe original fortran data file is given in spectra-2.data.  The file spectra-2.head contains information about the .data file contents and how to rescale the compressed spectral intensities. Has Missing Values? No",

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. \n \n The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.\n\n  Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range  0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value of  0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value.\n\n  The normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double the value for double the population within the available precision - except for extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to  0.00)).\n\n  However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with the value for blackPerCap for a community)\n\n  A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted.

Furthermore, only 2 of the 3 concepts are \"used\" during testing (i.e., those with the prototypes 000 and 111).  I've mapped all values to their zero-indexing equivalents.\n\nSome instances could be placed in either category 0 or 1.  I've followed the authors' suggestion, placing them in each category with equal probability.\n\nI've replaced the actual values of the attributes (i.e., hobby has values chess, sports and stamps) with numeric values.  I think this is how the authors' did this when testing the categorization models described in the paper.  I find this unfair.  While the subjects were able to bring background knowledge to bear on the attribute values and their relationships, the algorithms were provided with no such knowledge.  I'm uncertain whether the 2 distractor attributes (name and hobby) are presented to the authors' algorithms during testing.  However, it is clear that only the age, educational status, and marital status attributes are given during the human subjects' transfer tests. Has Missing Values? No",

The result of this comparison is summarized in \"The MONK's Problems - A Performance Comparison of Different Learning algorithms\" by S.B. Thrun, J. Bala, E. Bloedorn, I.  Bratko, B. Cestnik, J. Cheng, K. De Jong, S.  Dzeroski, S.E. Fahlman, D. Fisher, R. Hamann, K. Kaufman, S. Keller, I. Kononenko, J.  Kreuziger, R.S. Michalski, T. Mitchell, P.  Pachowicz, Y. Reich H.  Vafaie, W. Van de Welde, W. Wenzel, J. Wnek, and J. Zhang has been published as Technical Report CS-CMU-91-197, Carnegie Mellon University in Dec. 1991.\n\nOne significant characteristic of this comparison is that it was performed by a collection of researchers, each of whom was an advocate of the technique they tested (often they were the creators of the various methods). In this sense, the results are less biased than in comparisons performed by a single person advocating a specific learning method, and more accurately reflect the generalization behavior of the learning techniques as applied by knowledgeable users.\n\nThere are three MONK's problems.  The domains for all MONK's problems are the same (described below).  One of the MONK's problems has noise added. For each problem, the domain has been partitioned into a train and test set.

Nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance, with the analysis parameters described below, we applied 12-degree linear prediction analysis to it to obtain a discrete-time series with 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients. This means that one utterance by a speaker forms a time series whose length is in the range 7-29 and each point of a time series is of 12 features (12 coefficients).\n\nThe number of the time series is 640 in total. We used one set of 270 time series for training and the other set of 370 time series for testing.\n\nNumber of Instances (Utterances):\n\n    * Training: 270 (30 utterances by 9 speakers. See file 'size_ae.train'.)\n    * Testing: 370 (24-88 utterances by the same 9 speakers in different opportunities. See file 'size_ae.test'.) \n\nLength of Time Series:\n\n    * 7 - 29 depending on utterances \n\nAnalysis parameters:\n\n    * Sampling rate : 10kHz\n    * Frame length : 25.6 ms\n    * Shift length : 6.4ms\n    * Degree of LPC coefficients : 12 \n\nFiles:\n\n    * Training file: ae.train\n    * Testing file: ae.test \n\nFormat:\n\nEach line in ae.train or ae.test represents 12 LPC coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame.\n\nLines are organized into blocks, which are a set of 7-29 lines separated by blank lines and corresponds to a single speech utterance of /ae/ with 7-29 frames.\n\nEach speaker is a set of consecutive blocks. In ae.train there are 30 blocks for each speaker. Blocks 1-30 represent speaker 1, blocks 31-60 represent speaker 2, and so on up to speaker 9. In ae.test, speakers 1 to 9 have the corresponding number of blocks: 31 35 88 44 29 24 40 50 29. Thus, blocks 1-31 represent speaker 1 (31 utterances of /ae/), blocks 32-66 represent speaker 2 (35 utterances of /ae/), and so on. Has Missing Values? No",

The household and individual records were flattened into a single table and we used all variables that were available for all three years. When there was more than one version of a variable, such as for race, we used the most general. For occupation and industry we used the 1950 basis.\n\nNote that PUMS data is based on cluster samples, i.e. samples are made of households or dwellings from which there may be multiple individuals. Individuals from the same household are no longer independent.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information Drugs are typically small organic molecules that achieve their desired activity by binding to a target site on a receptor. The first step in the discovery of a new drug is usually to identify and isolate the receptor to which it should bind, followed by testing many small molecules for their ability to bind to the target site. This leaves researchers with the task of determining what separates the active (binding) compounds from the inactive (non-binding) ones. Such a determination can then be used in the design of new compounds that not only bind, but also have all the other properties required for a drug (solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action, toxicity, etc.). \nThe original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge.

The system in focus is the \n     Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised \n     air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, \n     such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' \n     positive class consists of component failures \n     for a specific component of the APS system. \n     The negative class consists of trucks with failures \n     for components not related to the APS. The data consists \n     of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. \n\n   -- Challenge metric  \n\n     Cost-metric of miss-classification:\n\n     Predicted class |      True class       |\n                     |    pos    |    neg    |\n     -----------------------------------------\n      pos            |     -     |  Cost_1   |\n     -----------------------------------------\n      neg            |  Cost_2   |     -     |\n     -----------------------------------------\n     Cost_1 = 10 and cost_2 = 500\n\n     The total cost of a prediction model the sum of 'Cost_1' \n     multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure \n     and 'Cost_2' with the number of instances with type 2 failure, \n     resulting in a 'Total_cost'.\n\n     In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary \n     check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while \n     Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, \n     which may cause a breakdown.\n\n     Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.\n\n5.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South) [1]. \n\nPulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses). \n\nAs pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars\nrotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.\n\nEach pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a  potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.\n\nMachine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,\n(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.\n\nThe data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. \n\nThe data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).\n\nPlease note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool (see [10]). Has Missing Values? No",

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.\n\nWe use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. \n\nThese writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this. \n\nIn our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.  \n\nIn order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.\n\nSo, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Has Missing Values? No",

At this point in time, the tool is replaced 69 times, and fails 51 times (randomly assigned).\nheat dissipation failure (HDF): heat dissipation causes a process failure, if the difference between air- and process temperature is below 8.6 K and the toolâ€™s rotational speed is below 1380 rpm. This is the case for 115 data points.\npower failure (PWF): the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s) equals the power required for the process. If this power is below 3500 W or above 9000 W, the process fails, which is the case 95 times in our dataset.\noverstrain failure (OSF): if the product of tool wear and torque exceeds 11,000 minNm for the L product variant (12,000 M, 13,000 H), the process fails due to overstrain. This is true for 98 datapoints.\nrandom failures (RNF): each process has a chance of 0,1 % to fail regardless of its process parameters. This is the case for only 5 datapoints, less than could be expected for 10,000 datapoints in our dataset.\n\nIf at least one of the above failure modes is true, the process fails and the 'machine failure' label is set to 1. It is therefore not transparent to the machine learning method, which of the failure modes has caused the process to fail"

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information Membranolytic anticancer peptides (ACPs) are drawing increasing attention as potential future therapeutics against cancer, due to their ability to hinder the development of cellular resistance and their potential to overcome common hurdles of chemotherapy, e.g., side effects and cytotoxicity. \nThis dataset contains information on peptides (annotated for their one-letter amino acid code) and their anticancer activity on breast and lung cancer cell lines.\nTwo peptide datasets targeting breast and lung cancer cells were assembled and curated manually from CancerPPD. EC50, IC50, LD50 and LC50 annotations on breast and lung cancer cells were retained (breast cell lines: MCF7â€‰=â€‰57%, MDA-MB-361â€‰=â€‰11%, MT-1â€‰=â€‰9%; lung cell lines: H-1299â€‰=â€‰45%, A-549â€‰=â€‰17.7%); mg mlâˆ’1 values were converted to Î¼M units. Linear and l-chiral peptides were retained, while cyclic, mixed or d-chiral peptides were discarded. In the presence of both amidated and non-amidated data for the same sequence, only the value referred to the amidated peptide was retained. Peptides were split into three classes for model training: (1) very active (EC/IC/LD/LC50â€‰â‰¤â€‰5 Î¼M), (2) moderately active (EC/IC/LD/LC50 values up to 50 Î¼M) and (3) inactive (EC/IC/LD/LC50â€‰>â€‰50 Î¼M) peptides. Duplicates with conflicting class annotations were compared manually to the original sources, and, if necessary, corrected. If multiple class annotations were present for the same sequence, the most frequently represented class was chosen; in case of ties, the less active class was chosen. Since the CancerPPD is biased towards the annotation of active peptides, we built a set of presumably inactive peptides by randomly extracting 750 alpha-helical sequences from crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (7â€“30 amino acids). The final training sets contained 949 peptides for Breast cancer and 901 peptides for Lung cancer. \nThe datasets were used to develop neural networks model for anticancer peptide design and are provided as .csv file in a .zip folder.\n\nAdditional details can be found in: Grisoni, F., Neuhaus, C.S., Hishinuma, M., Gabernet, G., Hiss, J.A., Kotera, M. and Schneider, G., 2019.

For each tested combination, 4 runs were performed and their results are reported as the 4 last columns. All times are measured in milliseconds*.\n\nThere are 14 parameter, the first 10 are ordinal and can only take up to 4 different powers of two values, and the 4 last variables are binary. Out of 1327104 total parameter combinations, only 241600 are feasible (due to various kernel constraints). This data set contains the results for all these feasible combinations.\n\nThe experiment was run on a desktop workstation running Ubuntu 16.04 Linux with an Intel Core i5 (3.5GHz), 16GB RAM, and a NVidia Geforce GTX 680 4GB GF580 GTX-1.5GB GPU. We use the 'gemm_fast' kernel from the automatic OpenCL kernel tuning library 'CLTune' (https://github.com/CNugteren/CLTune).\n\n* Note: for this kind of data sets it is usually better to work with the logarithm of the running times (see e.g. Falch and Elster, 'Machine learning-based auto-tuning for enhanced performance portability of OpenCL applications', 2015).

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record 12 users performing 5 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove. \n\nA rigid pattern of markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx.\n\nThe 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably.\n\nThe data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'.\n\nDue to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy. \n\nThis dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.\n\nIn previous work, we randomly sampled without replacement a constant number (e.g. 75) of records per class per user in order to balance classes.

Ranges from 1 to 5 with 1=Fist(with thumb out), 2=Stop(hand flat), 3=Point1(point with pointer finger), 4=Point2(point with pointer and middle fingers), 5=Grab(fingers curled as if to grab).\n'User' - Integer.

One may randomly permute the visible (not missing) markers of a given record without changing the set that the record represents.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South) [1]. \n\nPulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses). \n\nAs pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars\nrotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.\n\nEach pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a  potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.\n\nMachine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,\n(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.\n\nThe data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. \n\nThe data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).\n\nPlease note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool (see [10]). Has Missing Values? No",
    "additional_info": "Additional Variable Information Each candidate is described by 8 continuous variables, and a single class variable.

The remaining four variables are similarly obtained from the DM-SNR curve (again see [3] for more details). These are summarised below:\n\n1. Mean of the integrated profile.\n2. Standard deviation of the integrated profile.\n3. Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.\n4. Skewness of the integrated profile.\n5. Mean of the DM-SNR curve.\n6.

Thus, being able to specify a location with strong influence on the music is central. \n\nThe geographical location of origin was manually collected the information from the CD sleeve notes, and when this information was inadequate we searched other information sources. The location data is limited in precision to the country of origin.  \n\nThe country of origin was determined by the artist's or artists' main country/area of residence.

These describe the notes of the scale being used. This is especially important as a distinguishing feature in geographical ethnomusicology.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains. Has Missing Values? No",

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information 2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.

    "dataset_info": "Dataset Information Additional Information This data comes from a water quality study where samples were taken from sites on different European rivers of a period of approximately one year. These samples were analyzed for various chemical substances including: nitrogen in the form of nitrates, nitrites and ammonia, phosphate, pH, oxygen, chloride. In parallel, algae samples were collected to determine the algae population distributions. \n\nThe competition involved the prediction of algal frequency distributions on the basis of the measured concentrations of the chemical substances and the global information concerning the season when the sample was taken, the river size and its flow velocity. The competition instructions contain additional information on the prediction task: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/coil/instructions.txt Has Missing Values? No",
    "additional_info": "Additional Variable Information There are a total of 340 examples each containing 17 values. The first 11 values of each data set are the season, the river size, the fluid velocity and 8 chemical concentrations which should be relevant for the algae population distribution. The last 8 values of each example are the distribution of different kinds of algae. These 8 kinds are only a very small part of the whole community, but for the competition we limited the number to 7. The value 0.0 means that the frequency is very low. The data set also contains some empty fields which are labeled with the string XXXXX. \n\nThe training data are saved in the file: analysis.data (ASCII format).\n\nTable 1: Structure of the file analysis.data\n\nA ...
