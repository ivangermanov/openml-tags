This thesis marks the end of my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, prof. Joaquin Vanschoren, for his invaluable guidance and continuous support throughout the project. 

I am also sincerely thankful to my daily supervisor, Taniya Das, for her timely feedback and suggestions, and for pointing me to the relevant literature, all of which were instrumental in shaping the outcome of this work.
