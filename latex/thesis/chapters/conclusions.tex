\section{Recommendations}
1. Keep looking for improved sub-models — embedding model and fine-tuning model and zero-shot model especially. These models can be tested with the automated evaluation metrics and with the GPT evaluation quickly, quick iterations.
2. Look into training a custom zero-shot model with a better base architecture — this could be a separate Master's project on its own. Look into Moritz Laurer's work on zero-shot learning.
