The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate in this competition, which is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge.

To allow scientists without a background in image processing to participate, we provide pre-calculated feature sets. Each feature set contains the same directory structure as the training image set. For details on the parameters of the feature algorithm, please have a look at the file Feature Description, which is part of each archive file.

Hue Histograms
For each image in the training set, the file contains a histogram of hue values in the HSV color space.
