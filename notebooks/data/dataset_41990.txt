The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge.

To allow scientists without a background in image processing to participate, we provide several pre-calculated feature sets. Each feature set contains the same directory structure as the training image set. For details on the parameters of the feature algorithm, please have a look at the file Feature Description, which is part of each archive file.

Hue Histograms
For each image in the training set, the file contains a histogram of hue values in the HSV color space. This feature set provides a comprehensive representation of the color distribution in each image, allowing researchers to focus on developing effective classification models.
