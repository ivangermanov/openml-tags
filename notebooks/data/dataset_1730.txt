QSAR-TID-100629 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor-Type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Gamma, and it has multiple rows and numerous features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identification, numerous molecular fingerprint features, and median pseudo-pCI50.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when used.

The target protein is Receptor-Type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Gamma, also known as Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase Gamma, PTPG, PTPRG, R-PTP-Gamma, and others. It is an enzyme that belongs to the family of protein tyrosine phosphatases.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein dephosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, negative regulation of epithelial cell migration, negative regulation of neuron projection development, dephosphorylation, and regulation of homophilic cell adhesion.

It is located in the extracellular space, plasma membrane, membrane, and extracellular exosome. It has phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, protein binding, hydrolase activity, phosphatase activity, and identical protein binding.
