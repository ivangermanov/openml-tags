LIBRAS Movement Database 

The LIBRAS Movement Database contains fifteen classes of hand movement types in LIBRAS, the official Brazilian Sign Language, each consisting of twenty-four instances. A hand movement is represented as a two-dimensional curve performed by the hand over a period of time. These curves were obtained from videos of hand movements performed by four individuals during two separate sessions, with each video corresponding to a single hand movement lasting approximately seven seconds.

In the video preprocessing stage, time normalization was carried out by selecting forty-five frames from each video, following a uniform distribution. For each frame, the centroid pixels of the segmented objects, namely the hand, were identified, composing the discrete version of the curve with forty-five points. All curves were then normalized within a unitary space.

To prepare these movements for analysis by algorithms, a mapping operation was conducted, where each curve was mapped into a ninety-feature representation, capturing the coordinates of movement. Each instance represents forty-five points in a two-dimensional space, which can be plotted in an ordered sequence to illustrate the path of the movement.

The dataset does not contain missing values. Subdatasets are also available to facilitate comparisons of results.
