LIBRAS Movement Database

Tags: study

The LIBRAS Movement Database contains data on hand movements from the Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS). This dataset comprises multiple classes, each representing a distinct type of hand movement in LIBRAS. The hand movements are captured as two-dimensional curves performed over time.

The data was collected from video recordings of hand movements performed by several individuals across multiple sessions. Each video clip focuses on a single hand movement and lasts for several seconds. To process this data, the researchers applied time normalization by selecting frames from each video at uniform intervals. Within each selected frame, they identified the centroid pixels of the segmented hand object, resulting in a discrete representation of the movement curve.

All curves have been normalized within a unitary space for consistency. To facilitate analysis, the researchers mapped each curve to a representation consisting of numerous features, which correspond to the coordinates of the movement at various points. Each instance in the dataset represents a series of points in two-dimensional space, which can be plotted sequentially to visualize the path of the movement.

The dataset includes multiple numeric features representing x and y coordinates for each point along the movement path, as well as a class variable. All curves are normalized within a unitary space to ensure consistency across samples. The researchers have also prepared some sub-datasets to support comparative analyses of results.

This dataset is valuable for studying and analyzing hand movements in sign language, particularly for developing algorithms and models to recognize and interpret these movements. It offers a standardized representation of complex gestural data, making it suitable for various machine learning and pattern recognition tasks in the field of sign language processing and computer vision.
