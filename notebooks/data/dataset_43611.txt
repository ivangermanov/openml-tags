Context:
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Cytology Features dataset is a collection of cytology features of breast cancer biopsies. This dataset can be utilized to predict breast cancer based on these cytology features.

Data Description:
The dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A detailed description of the dataset can be found on the repository's website.

Content:
The dataset comprises cytology features of breast cancer biopsies, including clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitosis. The class variable indicates whether the sample is cancerous or not, with cancer denoted by one and non-cancer denoted by zero.

Attribute Information:
Each sample has a unique identifier, known as the sample code number. The remaining attributes describe various aspects of the breast cancer biopsy, including clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitosis. These attributes are scored on a scale of one to ten. Finally, the class attribute determines whether the sample is malignant or benign.
