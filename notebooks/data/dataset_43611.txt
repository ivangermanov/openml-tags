Wisconsin Breast Cancer Cytology Features

Tags: Context Cytology features of breast cancer biopsy. It can be used to predict breast cancer from cytology features.

The data was obtained from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Data Description:
The dataset contains cytology features of breast cancer biopsies, which can be used to predict whether a biopsy is cancerous or not. The features include clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitosis. The class variable denotes whether the biopsy is cancerous or not, with cancer denoted by one and not cancer denoted by zero.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes the following attributes: sample code number, clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, mitosis, and class.

The dataset is useful for predicting breast cancer from cytology features, and can be used to develop machine learning models for this purpose.
