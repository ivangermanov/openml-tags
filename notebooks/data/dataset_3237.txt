QSAR-TID-12752 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12752. The dataset has forty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Vitamin D Receptor, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group I Member One. The Vitamin D Receptor is a single protein, and its preferred name is Vitamin D Receptor. It is also known as one point two five dihydroxyvitamin D three receptor, Nr one i one, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group I Member One, Vdr, and VDR.

The Vitamin D Receptor is a transcription factor, and it is involved in various biological processes, including cell morphogenesis, skeletal system development, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, and response to estradiol. It is also involved in the regulation of calcium ion transport, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, and heart development.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is available for further analysis and research.
