The QSAR-TID-12752 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12752. This dataset has forty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Vitamin D receptor, also known as Nuclear receptor subfamily one group I member one.

The Vitamin D receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as one point two five dihydroxyvitamin D three receptor, Nr one i one, and Vdr.

This receptor is an organism of Rattus norvegicus species group, classified under protein target classification as one point Transcription factor slash Nuclear receptor slash Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one slash Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group I slash Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group I member one.

The description of this receptor is a nuclear receptor for vitamin D, which plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and regulating bone mineralization.

The dataset also includes information about the Gene Ontology, including cellular components, molecular functions, biological processes, and protein-protein interactions.
