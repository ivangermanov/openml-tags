Name: aa Tags: Adult Dataset, LIBSVM, UCI Machine Learning Repository

This dataset originates from the LIBSVM data repository and is also known as the Adult dataset. It was originally sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, though the exact date of creation is unknown. The dataset has undergone preprocessing to convert its original features into binary representations.

The initial Adult dataset contained fourteen features, comprising six continuous and eight categorical variables. In this version, the continuous features have been discretized into quantiles, with each quantile represented by a binary feature. Similarly, categorical features with multiple categories have been converted into multiple binary features, with the number of binary features corresponding to the number of categories.

Detailed information about the conversion process for each feature can be found at the beginning of the relevant files on the specified webpage. The dataset is commonly used for machine learning tasks, particularly in binary classification problems.

The features in this dataset are numerous and have been anonymized, represented as attributes numbered from one to over one hundred. Due to the preprocessing steps, the original meaning of these features may not be immediately apparent without referring to the documentation.

Researchers and practitioners using this dataset are encouraged to cite the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source. The dataset provides a valuable resource for those working on adult income prediction or related classification tasks in the field of machine learning and data science.
