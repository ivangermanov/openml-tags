GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating different quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among others, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from an increasing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems that can be utilized by diverse researchers. This enables the comparison of different classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available Expression Project for Oncology repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of the Expression Project for Oncology and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and is subsequently released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions. This readily available information translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Although numerous other sources of gene expression data are available, the decision to utilize data from the Expression Project for Oncology repository was made due to several factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the utilization of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of supplementary information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the availability of a substantial number of samples for various tumor types.
