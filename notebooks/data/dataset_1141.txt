GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating different quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, among others, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

This repository was inspired by the growing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems that could be utilized by diverse researchers. Consequently, numerous classification or feature selection techniques can be compared against one another on the same set of problems.

The origin of the data lies in the large, publicly accessible Expression Project for Oncology repository, maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of the Expression Project for Oncology and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is subsequently updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions. This availability of information directly benefits patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Although multiple sources of gene expression data are available, the decision to utilize data from the Expression Project for Oncology repository was made due to several factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the availability of a large number of samples for different tumor types.
