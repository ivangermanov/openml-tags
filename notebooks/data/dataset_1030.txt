Title: Employee Rejection/Acceptance (Original ERA)

Source Information:
The dataset was contributed by a donor from the Department of Technology Management at Holon Academic Institute of Technology in Israel. The owner is affiliated with the Business Administration School at Tel Aviv University.

Relevant Information:
The ERA dataset originated from an academic decision-making experiment aimed at identifying the most crucial qualities of job candidates for specific positions. Unlike the ESL dataset, which was compiled from expert recruiters, this dataset was collected during an MBA academic course. The input features in the dataset represent various attributes of candidates, such as past experience and verbal skills. The output is the subjective judgment of a decision-maker, indicating their inclination to accept or reject the applicant for the job. The lowest score signifies a complete tendency to reject an applicant, while higher scores indicate a greater likelihood of acceptance.
