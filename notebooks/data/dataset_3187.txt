QSAR-TID-266 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Gamma, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Gamma. The dataset has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Retinoid X Receptor Gamma is a Single Protein Preferred Name, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Three, Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-Gamma, and RXRG. It is a Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Three.

Retinoid X Receptor Gamma is a protein target classification, and it is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of DNA-templated transcription, cell differentiation, response to retinoic acid, steroid hormone mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway, and anatomical structure development.
