QSAR-TID-266 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 266, and it consists of one hundred thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.
