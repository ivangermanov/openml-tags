Name: Vehicle Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Vehicle with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The function first samples classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it samples columns uniformly, selecting a specified number of columns randomly. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
