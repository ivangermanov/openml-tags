Vehicle Seed Zero Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Strategically Sampled 

This dataset is a strategically sampled subset of the Vehicle dataset. The sampling process involved uniformly selecting ten classes from the available categories, followed by a random selection of one hundred columns from the total feature set. Additionally, the dataset was limited to two thousand rows to ensure a manageable size.

The sampling process was performed using a random number generator with a seed value of zero. This ensured reproducibility and consistency across different iterations of the sampling process.

The features in this dataset include compactness, circularity, distance circularity, radius ratio, principal axis aspect ratio, maximum length aspect ratio, scatter ratio, elongatedness, principal axis rectangularity, maximum length rectangularity, scaled variance major, scaled variance minor, scaled radius of gyration, skewness about major, skewness about minor, kurtosis about major, kurtosis about minor, and hollows ratio.
