**Laser** Tags: 

This dataset was originally a univariate time record of a single observed quantity, recorded from a Far Infrared Laser in a chaotic state. The original set has been adapted for regression by considering every set of consecutive values as inputs, and the next one as output. Duplicated instances have been removed. 

The dataset features inputs and an output. 

Please cite this laser generated dataset. The dataset is available on KEEL, and the original source is also available.
