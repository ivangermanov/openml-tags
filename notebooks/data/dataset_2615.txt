The Weather Problem dataset is a small yet illustrative collection of data that will be used throughout to demonstrate various machine learning techniques. This entirely fictional dataset revolves around the ideal conditions necessary for participating in an unspecified outdoor game. Typically, instances within a dataset are defined by the values of their respective features or attributes, which serve to quantify distinct aspects of each instance. In the context of the Weather Problem, there exist four primary attributes that influence the decision-making process: the overall outlook, the ambient temperature, the relative humidity, and the presence of wind. Ultimately, the desired outcome is a determination of whether the prevailing conditions are conducive to playing the aforementioned game.
