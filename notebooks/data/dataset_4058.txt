The Sulfur Recovery Unit removes environmental pollutants from acid gas streams before they are released into the atmosphere, thereby ensuring a cleaner environment. Furthermore, elemental sulfur is recovered as a valuable byproduct.

This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. It has five input variables, which are related to gas and air flows. The two output variables to be predicted are Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide concentrations.
