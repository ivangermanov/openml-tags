This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. The activity values are in units of pseudo-pCI fifty. 

The target protein is Aminopeptidase N, also known as Alanyl Aminopeptidase, Aminopeptidase M, and AP-M. It belongs to the Metallo Protease MAE Clan and Metallo Protease M one Family. 

This enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, proteolysis, cell differentiation, peptide catabolic process, and viral entry into host cells. It has peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and virus receptor activity. 

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, Aminopeptidase N, FCFP, Molecular Fingerprints, Drug Target, Angiogenesis, Proteolysis, Cell Differentiation.
