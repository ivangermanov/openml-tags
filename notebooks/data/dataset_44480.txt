Amazon Commerce Reviews Seed Two Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Amazon Commerce Reviews dataset, generated with a seed of two. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several arguments, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. The function uses the NumPy random default random generator to sample the data.

First, the function samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes from the unique classes in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, the function samples the columns uniformly, selecting a specified number of columns from the dataset. It then subsets the data to include only these columns.

Finally, the function samples the rows, using stratified sampling if specified. It uses the train test split function from scikit-learn to split the data into a subset of the specified size.

The resulting dataset is a smaller, more manageable version of the original Amazon Commerce Reviews dataset, with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes.

Features: product ratings, product reviews, customer feedback, and more.
