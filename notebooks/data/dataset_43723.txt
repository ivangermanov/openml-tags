Toronto Apartment Rental Price Tags: Context

I have collected the Toronto Apartment Rental prices from various sources in local websites. The dataset contains a wealth of information, with seven columns that provide a comprehensive overview of the rental market.

The first column, Bedrooms, indicates how many bedrooms are available in each apartment. The second column, Bathrooms, specifies the number of bathrooms in each unit. The third column, Den, reveals whether a den is available or not. The fourth column, Address, provides the location of each apartment. The fifth and sixth columns, Latitude and Longitude, offer precise geographic coordinates for each address. The seventh and final column, Price, lists the apartment rental price per month in Canadian dollars.

I would highly recommend exploring this dataset further to uncover more insights and visualize the data. Predicting the price of an apartment based on its features would be a fascinating project.
