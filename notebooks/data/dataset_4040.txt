QSAR-TID-20162 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20162. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20162. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate Fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor two, which is a protein target that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway.

The dataset also contains information on the Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with the Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor two, including plasma membrane, membrane, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity.
