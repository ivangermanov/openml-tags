QSAR-TID-20162 Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, study three, Transportation

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: two thousand one hundred sixty-two, and it has one hundred fifty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint features from zero to nine hundred ninety-eight.
