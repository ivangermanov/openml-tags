The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game. In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. In this case, there are four attributes that describe each instance: the outlook, which refers to the general weather conditions; the temperature, which indicates how hot or cold it is outside; the humidity, which measures the amount of moisture in the air; and windy, which indicates whether it is breezy or not. The outcome is whether to play or not.
