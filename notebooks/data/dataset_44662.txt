Name: Churn Seed Four Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Churn with seed equals Four, arguments nrows max equals Two Thousand, arguments ncols max equals One Hundred, arguments nclasses max equals Ten, arguments no stratify equals False.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the dataset. The function first samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function samples the columns uniformly, selecting a specified number of columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function stratifies the data according to the target variable and samples the rows accordingly.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset with the sampled data.
