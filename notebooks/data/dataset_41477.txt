The Electrical Discharge Machining dataset represents a two-target regression problem. The task is to shorten the machining time by reproducing the behavior of a human operator who controls the values of two variables. Each of the target variables takes distinct numeric values, and there are sixteen continuous input variables. The goal is to optimize the machining process by predicting the optimal settings for the input variables. This dataset is particularly challenging due to the complex relationships between the input and output variables.

Features include various measurements of machining parameters, such as mean and standard deviation of time, and flow and gap settings.
