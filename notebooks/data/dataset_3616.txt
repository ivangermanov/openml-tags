QSAR-TID-105 Dataset Information

The QSAR-TID-105 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 105. This dataset has 1251 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features.

Features
--------

The features in this dataset represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Dataset Description
-------------------

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 105.

Target Information
-----------------

The target of interest is the Serotonin 1d (5-HT1d) receptor, also known as 5-HT1D, 5-HT-1D, 5-HT-1D-alpha, and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D. This receptor is a single protein and is classified as a membrane receptor/family A G protein-coupled receptor/small molecule receptor (family A GPCR)/monoamine receptor/serotonin receptor.

Organism and Species Group
---------------------------

The organism associated with this target is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group of no protein target classification.

Description and Relationship
-----------------------------

This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission. It is also related to other targets, such as serotonin 1 receptors, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT1D, as well as the serotonin (5-HT) receptor protein family.
