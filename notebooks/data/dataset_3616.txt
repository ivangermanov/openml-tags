QSAR-TID-105 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 105. The dataset has 1251 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a set of numerical values. These fingerprints can be used to predict the activity of compounds on a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a valuable resource for identifying potential lead compounds and optimizing their activity.

The target protein in this dataset is the Serotonin 1d receptor, which is a type of G protein-coupled receptor. This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and neurotransmission.
