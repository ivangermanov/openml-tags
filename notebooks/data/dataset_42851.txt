Scraped Data: Dataset Information

What do the instances in this dataset represent? Each instance is a plant.

Additional Information: This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning. The dataset contains three classes of plants, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain.

The dataset differs from the data presented in the original article. There are some errors in the original data, which have been corrected. For example, one sample had an error in the fourth feature, and another sample had errors in the second and third features.

Has Missing Values? No
