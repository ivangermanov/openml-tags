QSAR-TID-30013 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30013. The data consists of two hundred forty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and many others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.
