**Data Description**
A realistic simulation of the forward dynamics of an eight-link all-revolute robot arm is presented in this dataset. The primary task is to predict the distance of the end effector from a target. To achieve this, the input consists of the angular positions of the joints. This task is characterized as moderately noisy and nonlinear. Each instance represents a unique configuration of angular positions of the joints and the resulting distance of the end effector from a target.

**Attribute Description**
The attributes included in this dataset are as follows:

One through Eight Joint Angular Positions - these values represent the angular positions of each joint in the robot arm.

Resulting Distance of End Effector from Target - this attribute denotes the target feature, which is the predicted distance of the end effector from the target.

Features: theta one, theta two, theta three, theta four, theta five, theta six, theta seven, theta eight, resulting distance 

Keywords: Robot Arm, Forward Dynamics, Angular Positions, Noisy Nonlinear Task, End Effector Distance Prediction.
