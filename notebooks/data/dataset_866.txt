Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled as oz followed by a number. The final feature is labeled binaryClass.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification task. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies and is tagged for use in mythbusting exercises. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in exploring the effects of binarization on regression problems and comparing the performance of various machine learning algorithms on such transformed datasets.

The origin and creation date of this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper documentation and attribution in data science. Users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately in their work, acknowledging its role as a binarized version of an earlier dataset.
