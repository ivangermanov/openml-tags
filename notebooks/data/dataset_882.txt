Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on pollution-related factors and their impacts. It includes various environmental and demographic features that may contribute to or be affected by pollution levels. The binarization process allows for a simplified classification of pollution levels into two distinct categories, facilitating easier analysis and interpretation of the data.

The dataset encompasses a wide range of variables, including precipitation, temperature measurements for January and July, population demographics such as the percentage of elderly residents and overall population density, educational attainment, housing characteristics, racial composition, employment patterns, poverty rates, and various pollutant measurements including hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and humidity levels.

This binarized version of the pollution dataset provides researchers and analysts with a streamlined approach to studying the complex relationships between environmental factors, socioeconomic indicators, and pollution levels. By reducing the target variable to a binary classification, it enables more straightforward statistical analyses and machine learning applications, potentially uncovering important insights into the determinants and consequences of pollution in different areas.
