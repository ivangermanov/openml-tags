The QSAR-TID-47 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 47, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2 is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including CHRM2 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and has a protein target classification of one dot Membrane Receptor Family A G protein-coupled receptor Small molecule receptor family A GPCR Monoamine receptor Acetylcholine receptor.

The description relationship accession is Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2 Single Protein P zero eight one seven two.

Keywords: QSAR, Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2, MetaQSAR, FCFP, Molecular Fingerprints, SMILES, Pipeline Pilot, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.
