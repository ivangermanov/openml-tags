QSAR-TID-47 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 47. The dataset has a total of 1953 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and nervous system development.

The Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction, heart rate, and other physiological processes. It is a target for various drugs, including anticholinergics, which are used to treat conditions such as overactive bladder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization, among other applications.
