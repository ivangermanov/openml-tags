**Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample 1.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a total of thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, with a substantial number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, and the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model that represents the complex relationships between various factors influencing mildew in winter wheat.

**Please cite the original research paper** for more information on the development and application of this network.

Features of this network include microclimate, leaf area index, fungal diseases, and various environmental factors such as temperature, radiation, and precipitation.

Keywords: Bayesian network, mildew, winter wheat, agriculture, environmental factors, fungal diseases.
