This dataset collects data from an android smartphone positioned in the chest pocket, which allows for the collection of accelerometer data from individuals walking in the wild over a predefined path. The dataset is primarily intended for activity recognition research purposes, providing challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns. 

Attribute Information 

The dataset consists of time steps and acceleration data in three dimensions - x acceleration, y acceleration, and z acceleration - with the target being user identification. 

The dataset was created by combining individual datasets from each participant, resulting in a single comprehensive dataset. 

Additional Information 

The dataset was designed to collect accelerometer data from individuals walking in the wild over a predefined path, allowing researchers to study activity recognition and user identification through motion patterns. The sampling frequency of the accelerometer was set to the fastest delay possible, with network connections disabled to ensure accurate data collection. A total of twenty-two participants contributed to the dataset, with no missing values present. The data is formatted in a comma-separated value file.
