The QSAR-TID-10501 dataset is a collection of QSAR data related to the life science domain, specifically focusing on machine learning and multi-task learning QSAR models. It consists of 147 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features.

This dataset contains activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 10501, measured in units of pseudo-pCI50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Since generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, followed by a series of FCFP6_1024 features ranging from 0 to 1023. These features are machine-readable and are used for modeling purposes.

The drug target, Cannabinoid CB1 Receptor, is a single protein receptor primarily found in the brain. It is also known as the Brain-Type Cannabinoid Receptor, Cannabinoid Receptor One, CB1, CB-R, and Cnr1. This receptor belongs to the family of small molecule receptors and is classified under the category of membrane receptors.

According to Expression Atlas, this receptor is expressed in various components, including the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, mitochondrial outer membrane, plasma membrane, actin cytoskeleton, and others. It plays a crucial role in multiple biological processes, such as signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, spermatogenesis, axonal fasciculation, and response to nutrients.
