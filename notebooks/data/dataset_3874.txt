Worldwide Meat Consumption 

Tags: Demographics, Health 

Meat consumption is closely tied to living standards, dietary preferences, livestock production, and consumer prices, as well as broader economic trends and uncertainties. In comparison to other commodities, meat is characterized by high production costs and correspondingly high output prices. As incomes rise, so does the demand for meat, driven in part by urbanization and shifting consumer preferences towards protein-rich foods derived from animal sources.

While the global meat industry provides sustenance and livelihoods for billions of people around the world, it also has far-reaching environmental and health implications for the planet. This dataset presents comprehensive projections of worldwide meat consumption up to twenty twenty-six, broken down by type of meat, including beef and veal, pork, poultry, and sheep.

Meat consumption is quantified in terms of thousand tonnes of carcass weight, except in the case of poultry, which is expressed in ready-to-cook weight. Additionally, per-capita consumption is measured in kilograms of retail weight. To facilitate conversions between these different metrics, the following carcass-weight-to-retail-weight conversion factors have been established: point seven for beef and veal, point seventy-eight for pork, and point eighty-eight for both sheep meat and poultry meat.

This dataset encompasses all twenty-eight member states of the European Union, excluding only Iceland.

Content 

The CSV file comprises five columns: Location, denoting the country code name; Subject, specifying the type of meat; Time, indicating the year in which the data was recorded; Measure, outlining the unit of measurement employed; and Value, providing the actual numerical value corresponding to the specified measure.
