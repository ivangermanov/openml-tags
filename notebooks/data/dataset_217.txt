Please cite: The task consists of Learning Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs). The Inhibition of Dihydrofolate Reductase by Pyrimidines.

The data are described in a study on drug design by machine learning, specifically using inductive logic programming to model the structure activity relationships of trimethoprim analogues binding to dihydrofolate reductase. The original source is unknown.

This dataset is part of a collection of regression datasets available online. It is characterized by cases and continuous variables.

Features include various molecular properties such as polarity, size, flexibility, hydrogen donor and acceptor capabilities, pi donor and acceptor properties, polarizability, and sigma values for different molecular components. The dataset also includes an activity measure.

The study focuses on using machine learning techniques to understand and predict the relationships between molecular structures and their biological activities, particularly in the context of drug design and development. This approach aims to improve the efficiency of drug discovery processes by leveraging computational methods to analyze complex chemical and biological data.
