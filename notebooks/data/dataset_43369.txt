Since its inception, Airbnb has disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more travelers decide to use Airbnb as their primary means of accommodation. Airbnb offers travelers a more unique and personalized way of accommodation and experience, allowing them to stay in a variety of settings, from apartments to villas, and experience the local culture.

This dataset has columns describing features such as the host identification, host name, listing identification, listing name, latitude and longitude of the listing, the neighborhood, price, room type, minimum number of nights, number of reviews, last review date, reviews per month, availability, host listings, and city.

This dataset is a compilation of multiple datasets found on Inside Airbnb, providing a comprehensive view of the Airbnb landscape.

The possibilities for analysis and discovery are endless. For instance, can we predict the price of each house in different regions? Can we describe a region using the names of listings in that region? What can we learn about different regions from the data? Based on different factors, is it possible to recommend a title to the host for their listing? Can we estimate the popularity of a listing based on given features?
