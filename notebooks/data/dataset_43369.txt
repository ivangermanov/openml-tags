U.S. Airbnb Open Data 
Tags: 

Since its inception, Airbnb has disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more travelers decide to use Airbnb as their primary means of accommodation. Airbnb offers travelers a more unique and personalized way of accommodation and experience.

This dataset has columns describing features such as host identification, host name, listing identification, listing name, latitude and longitude of listing, the neighborhood, price, room type, minimum number of nights, number of reviews, last review date, reviews per month, availability, host listings and city.

The dataset is a compilation of multiple datasets found on Inside Airbnb.

Some potential areas of exploration include:

* Can we predict the price of each house in different regions?
* Can we describe a region using the names of listings in that region?
* What can we learn about different regions from the data?
* Based on different factors, is it possible to recommend a title to the host for his or her listing?
* Can we estimate the popularity of a listing based on given features?

Features include:
host identification, host name, listing name, neighborhood group, neighborhood, latitude, longitude, room type, price, minimum nights, number of reviews, last review, reviews per month, calculated host listings count, availability, and city.
