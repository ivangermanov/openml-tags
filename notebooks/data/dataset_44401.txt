Magic Telescope Dataset Subsampling 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Magic Telescope dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its representativeness.

The dataset has been generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, and maximum number of classes. Additionally, the stratification option has been set to true, which ensures that the sampling process preserves the class distribution of the original dataset.

The subsampled dataset consists of a reduced number of features, carefully selected to represent the most important aspects of the original dataset. These features have been chosen through a uniform sampling process, ensuring that they are representative of the overall dataset.

The dataset has been generated using a Python function, which takes into account the specified arguments and applies them to the original Magic Telescope dataset. This function uses various techniques, such as stratified sampling and uniform column selection, to ensure that the resulting dataset is representative and balanced.
