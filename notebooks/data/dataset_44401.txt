Magic Telescope Dataset Subsampling with Seed Four

This dataset is a subsample of the Magic Telescope dataset, generated with a seed of four. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns, as well as stratified sampling of rows.

The original dataset was reduced to a maximum of ten classes, and the classes were selected based on their frequency in the original dataset. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, resulting in a subset of the original data.

The columns were also uniformly sampled, with a maximum of one hundred columns selected. The selected columns were chosen randomly, and the data was filtered to include only these columns.

Finally, the rows were stratified sampled, with a maximum of two thousand rows selected. The stratified sampling was done based on the class labels, to ensure that the resulting dataset was representative of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has the same characteristics as the original Magic Telescope dataset, but with a reduced number of classes, columns, and rows.
