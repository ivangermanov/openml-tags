QSAR-TID-30012 Dataset Information

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30012. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015.

Dataset Characteristics:

* The dataset consists of multiple compounds and their corresponding activity values.
* The activity values are measured in units of pseudo-pCI50.
* The molecular fingerprints were generated using the FCFP method.

Features:

* MOLECULE CHEMBL ID
* Multiple molecular fingerprint features (human-readable format not possible)

Compound Information:

* The compounds are related to the drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FRK.
* The target is a single protein and is also known as FRK, FYN-related kinase, Nuclear Tyrosine Protein Kinase, RAK, and Protein-Tyrosine Kinase 5.
* The target belongs to the species Homo sapiens.

Biological Information:

* The target is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, specifically a tyrosine protein kinase belonging to the Src family.
* It is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, phosphorylation, cell differentiation, and innate immune response.
