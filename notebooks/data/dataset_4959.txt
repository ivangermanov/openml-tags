**Water Bayesian Network. Sample Seven.**

The Water Bayesian Network is a discrete medium-sized network with thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, resulting in ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is around four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

This network was part of a pilot project focused on creating an expert system for control of waste water treatment. It was designed to model the complex relationships between various factors influencing the wastewater treatment process.

The network is characterized by its relatively high number of parameters and moderate average Markov blanket size, indicating a reasonable level of complexity. The average degree suggests that each node has around four connections to other nodes, which is relatively dense.
