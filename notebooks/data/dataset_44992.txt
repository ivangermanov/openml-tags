**Data Description**

This dataset contains Frames Per Second (FPS) measurement of video games executed on computers. Each row of the dataset describes the outcome of FPS measurement (outcome is attribute FPS) for a video game executed on a computer. A computer is characterized by the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). For both, the name is resolved to technical specifications that describe the factory state of the respective component. The game is characterized by the name, the displayed resolution, and the quality setting that was adjusted during the measurement.

**Attribute Description**

CPU

The CPU attributes include the number of physical cores, number of threads, base clock in megahertz, total size of level one cache in kilobytes, total size of level two cache in kilobytes, total size of level three cache in megabytes, physical size of the die in square meters, frequency in megahertz, multiplier of CPU, whether the multiplier is locked or unlocked, used process size in nanometers, thermal design power in watts, count of transistors in millions, and turbo clock in megahertz.

GPU

The GPU attributes include bandwidth in megabytes per second, base clock in megahertz, boost clock in megahertz, number of computing units, physical size of die in square meters, number of execution units, theoretical Float 32 performance in megaflops per second, width of memory bus in bits, size of memory in megabytes, theoretical pixel rate in megapixels per second, used process size in nanometers, number of render output units, number of shading units, number of texture mapping units, theoretical texture rate in kilotexels per second, number of transistors in millions, architecture code, memory type, version of OpenCL, version of shader model, version of Vulkan, version of OpenGL, and bus interface.

Game

The game attributes include the game name, displayed resolution, and quality setting.
