This dataset contains Frames Per Second (FPS) measurements of video games executed on computers. Each row of the dataset describes the outcome of FPS measurement for a video game executed on a computer. A computer is characterized by its Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Both the CPU and GPU have their names resolved to technical specifications.

The technical specifications of the CPU include its Number of Physical Cores, Number of Threads, Base Clock Speed in Megahertz, Total Size of Level One Cache in Kilobytes, Total Size of Level Two Cache in Kilobytes, Total Size of Level Three Cache in Megabytes, Physical Size of the Die in Square Meter, Frequency in Megahertz, Multiplier, whether the Multiplier is Unlocked, Process Size in Nanometer, Thermal Design Power in Watt, Count of Transistors in Million, and Turbo Clock Speed in Megahertz.

The technical specifications of the GPU include its Bandwidth in Megabytes per second, Base Clock Speed in Megahertz, Boost Clock Speed in Megahertz, Number of Computing Units, Physical Size of the Die in Square Meter, Number of Execution Units, Theoretical Float Thirty-Two Performance in Mega Floating Point Operations per second, Width of Memory Bus in Bits, Size of Memory in Megabytes, Theoretical Pixel Rate in Mega Pixels per second, Process Size in Nanometer, Number of Render Output Units, Number of Shading Units, Number of Texture Mapping Units, Theoretical Texture Rate in Kilo Texels per second, Count of Transistors in Million, Architecture Code, Memory Type, Version of Open Computing Language, Version of Shader Model, Version of Vulkan, Version of OpenGL, and Bus Interface.

The game is characterized by its Name, Displayed Resolution, and Quality Setting that was adjusted during the measurement.

From the original data, only those observations are considered where the Dataset feature's value is fps-benchmark, and then the column is removed.
