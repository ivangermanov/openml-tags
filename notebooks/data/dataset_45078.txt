Nomao collects data about places, including their name, phone number, and localization, from many sources. The process of deduplication involves detecting which data refer to the same place. In the dataset, instances compare two spots to determine if they are the same location.

The Nomao dataset has been enriched during the Nomao Challenge, which was organized along with the Active Learning in Real-world Applications workshop held at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases conference.

The dataset features a wide range of attributes, including various characteristics of the places.

Keywords: place data, deduplication, data collection, localization, dataset enrichment.
