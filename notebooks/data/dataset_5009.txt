**Diabetes Bayesian Network Sample**

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a discrete very large network repository reference available at bnlearn. This network consists of nodes and arcs, with a total number of parameters.

This model-based approach to insulin adjustment was developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of diabetes management.

The network features various variables related to diabetes, including meal, cholesterol, insulin absorption, activation, sensitivity, glucose production, and balance.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and healthcare professionals seeking to better understand the complex relationships between these variables and develop more effective treatment strategies.
