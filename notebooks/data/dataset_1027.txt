Name: ESL
Tags: Employee Selection, Ordinal Data

The ESL dataset contains profiles of applicants for certain industrial jobs. Expert psychologists from a recruiting company determined the values of the input attributes based on psychometric test results and interviews with the candidates. The output is an overall score corresponding to the degree of fitness of the candidate for this type of job.

The dataset consists of profiles for applicants, with four input attributes and one output attribute. All input and output values are ordinal. There are no missing attribute values in the dataset.

The data was collected from a recruiting company specializing in industrial job placements. The psychologists used their expertise to evaluate candidates through various assessment methods, including psychometric testing and personal interviews. This comprehensive evaluation process allowed for a thorough assessment of each applicant's suitability for the specific industrial positions.

The overall fitness score provided as the output attribute represents a holistic evaluation of the candidate's potential performance and compatibility with the job requirements. This score takes into account various factors assessed during the selection process, providing a valuable metric for decision-making in the hiring process.

The ESL dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of human resources, organizational psychology, and data science. It offers insights into the employee selection process and can be used to develop and test predictive models for job fit and performance.
