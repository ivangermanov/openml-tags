This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. It has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

The dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version. It shows activity values unit is pseudo-pCI50 of several compounds on drug target.

The molecular fingerprints were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
