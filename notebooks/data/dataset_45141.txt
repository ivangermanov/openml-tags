**Child Bayesian Network. Sample**

The Child Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium network repository referenced on the bnlearn website. This network consists of twenty nodes connected by twenty-five arcs, resulting in two hundred thirty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is three, while the average degree is two point five, with a maximum in-degree of two.

This network represents a comprehensive model for diagnosing and treating diseases in children. It takes into account various factors, including age, medical history, and physical examination results. The network is designed to facilitate probabilistic reasoning and decision-making in uncertain medical environments.

The Child Bayesian Network has been widely used in machine learning and life science applications. Its structure and parameters have been carefully crafted to reflect real-world relationships between medical variables, making it an ideal testbed for evaluating probabilistic inference algorithms and decision-support systems.
