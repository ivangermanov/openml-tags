This Bayesian network is a comprehensive model consisting of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, and the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree of the network is five.

The Water Bayesian Network is a notable example of a discrete-medium network, showcasing the complexity and interconnectedness of various factors in a waste water treatment system.
