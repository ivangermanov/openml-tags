The sulfur recovery unit removes environmental pollutants from acid gas streams before they are released into the atmosphere, thereby minimizing their negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, this process also recovers elemental sulfur as a valuable byproduct, which can be utilized in various industrial applications.

In order to optimize the performance of the sulfur recovery unit, five input variables are taken into consideration, namely gas flow and air flow. These input variables play a crucial role in determining the output concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, which are critical parameters in assessing the effectiveness of the sulfur recovery unit.

The primary objective is to predict the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide based on the input variables. This requires developing a robust model that can accurately capture the complex relationships between the input and output variables.
