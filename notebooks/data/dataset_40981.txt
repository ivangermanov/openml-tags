Australian Credit Approval

This dataset is derived from the Credit Approval dataset, even though both datasets exist individually on the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. In this version, missing values were filled in and a duplicate feature was removed.

The Australian Credit Approval dataset originates from the StatLog project and concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect the confidentiality of the data. This dataset was retrieved from the UCI site and converted to the ARFF format.

There are six numerical and eight categorical attributes, all normalized to a range of minus one to one. The dataset is interesting because it has a good mix of attributes, including continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values. There are also a few missing values.

The dataset features a range of attributes, including categorical and continuous variables. The categorical attributes have been relabeled for convenience, with original labels replaced by numerical values. For example, attribute four originally had three labels, which were replaced by labels one, two, and three.

The dataset is useful for machine learning and statistical analysis, with a good balance of attribute types and a moderate number of missing values.
