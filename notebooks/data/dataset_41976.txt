Tuning SVMs Tags: study

This is a meta-dataset that describes the Support Vector Machine hyperparameter tuning problem. The target attribute indicates whether tuning is required or default hyperparameter values are enough for each dataset. Targets were defined using a statistical labeling rule comparing the predictive performance of models induced with default values and tuned ones. In this version of the dataset, the labeling rule was set with a high confidence level.

Features of this dataset include characteristics of the datasets themselves, such as the number of classes, attributes, and samples, as well as dimensionality and rates of numeric and nominal attributes. Additionally, there are features related to the statistical properties of the datasets, including skewness, kurtosis, and correlation. Information-theoretic features, such as class entropy and attribute entropy, are also included. Furthermore, model-based features, such as the number of nodes and leaves in decision trees, are present. Landmarking features, including naive Bayes and decision stump metrics, are also part of this dataset. Finally, there are features related to the density and connectivity of the datasets, including edge counts and closeness centrality.
