TuningSVMs Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This meta-dataset describes the Support Vector Machine hyperparameter tuning problem. The target attribute indicates whether tuning is required or default hyperparameter values are sufficient for each dataset (row). Targets were defined using a statistical labeling rule, comparing the predictive performance of models induced with default values and tuned ones.

In this version of the dataset, the labeling rule was set with a high level of confidence. 

The features characterizing each dataset include general characteristics, statistical properties, information-theoretic measures, and model-based metrics. 

General characteristics comprise the number of datasets, classes, attributes, samples, dimensionality, numeric rate, nominal rate, symbols minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, sum, class probability minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and others.

Statistical properties encompass skewness, kurtosis, absolute correlation, canonical correlation, fractal dimension, and others.

Information-theoretic measures include class entropy, normalized class entropy, attribute entropy, normalized attribute entropy, joint entropy, mutual information, equivalent attributes, noise signal ratio, and others.

Model-based metrics consist of nodes, leaves, nodes per attribute, nodes per instance, leaf corroboration, level minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, branch minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, attribute minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, NA, naive Bayes, stump minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, minimum gain, random stump, nearest neighbor, and others.
