QSAR-TID-10970 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10970. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the CaM kinase I alpha protein, which is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 1. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and nervous system development.

The CaM kinase I alpha protein is a single protein target and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK1 family. It is expressed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cytosol and has various functions, including nucleotide binding, catalytic activity, and protein binding.
