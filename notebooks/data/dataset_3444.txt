Fish Market Dataset 

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset consists of a comprehensive record of various fish species sold in a fish market. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of a predictive model capable of estimating the weight of fish based on machine-friendly data. 

Acknowledgments 
We would like to extend our gratitude to all individuals who have utilized this dataset to create kernels, as well as those who have viewed or downloaded the data.

Inspiration 
The application of multiple linear regression is an essential aspect of working with this dataset. Additionally, multivariate analysis can also be performed to gain deeper insights into the characteristics of the fish species.

Features 
Species, Weight, Length, Height, and Width are the primary attributes of this dataset. These features provide valuable information about the physical characteristics of the fish, enabling researchers to develop accurate predictive models.
