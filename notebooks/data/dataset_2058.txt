QSAR-TID-10462 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10462. It has nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-five more molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10462. The data provides valuable insights into the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity, allowing researchers to better understand the underlying mechanisms of action.
