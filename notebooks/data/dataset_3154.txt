QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is associated with the MetaQSAR project from September. It focuses on the Serine/threonine protein kinase DCLK, also known as DCAMKL, DCDCC, DCLK, Doublecortin domain containing protein C, and Doublecortin like and CAM kinase like. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein target.

The protein has several associated Gene Ontology (GO) classifications. Its cellular components include the nucleus and cytoplasm. Its molecular functions encompass nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity. The biological processes it's involved in are protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, and peptidyl serine phosphorylation.

The protein is referenced in various databases including ExpressionAtlas, canSAR Target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. InterPro annotations include protein kinase domain, serine/threonine kinase active site, kinase like domain superfamily, and protein kinase ATP binding site.
