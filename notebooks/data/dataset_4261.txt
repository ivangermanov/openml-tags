**Meta-Album Birds Dataset (Mini)**

When the Meta-Album was created, the Birds dataset contained images of bird species, but now it has increased the number of species. It has a large collection of images, each with a high-quality resolution, showcasing birds in their natural habitats, which can sometimes lead to biases. Additionally, the dataset is imbalanced regarding the ratio of male species images to female species images.
