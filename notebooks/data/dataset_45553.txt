The FICO-HELOC-Cleaned Dataset 

This dataset originates from the Explainable Machine Learning Challenge, a collaborative effort between Google, FICO, and academic institutions such as Berkeley, Oxford, Imperial, UC Irvine, and MIT. The primary objective of this challenge is to develop machine learning models that not only possess high accuracy but also exhibit explainability.

To achieve this goal, participants will utilize a real-world financial dataset provided by FICO, with the aim of creating models that can provide clear insights into their decision-making processes. This increased transparency will ultimately benefit both designers and end-users of machine learning algorithms.

Model explanations are a critical component of this challenge, as they offer written descriptions of how trained models function. These explanations may encompass details regarding the importance of specific variables or examples, the underlying logic employed by algorithms, and the relationships between inputs, outputs, and predictions. 

By providing these explanations, participating teams will effectively narrate the story behind their models, which will then be subject to qualitative evaluation by data scientists at FICO. 

Further information regarding the Explainable Machine Learning Challenge can be accessed through the FICO website.

**Notes**

We have sourced the dataset from Kaggle, specifically from the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) dataset. 

This particular version has been cleaned to remove rows containing a special value (-9), as per the FAQ guidelines. To gain access to the complete feature descriptions, please visit the FICO website.

In this version, we have replaced special values (-9, -8, -7) with missing values to facilitate compatibility with non-tree models.
