Dataset Creation
From the original dataset, nuisance variables were removed to ensure a cleaner and more organized dataset. Variables were recoded to be clear and intuitive, making it easier for users to understand and work with the data. A series of dummy variables were created based on the services offered by each apartment, including amenities such as television, Wi-Fi, air conditioning, wheelchair accessibility, kitchen, breakfast, elevator, heating, washer, iron, and more.
