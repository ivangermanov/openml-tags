Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of classes, columns, and rows. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes based on their frequency in the data. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of columns uniformly at random. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. The function returns a dataset with the selected data and metadata.
