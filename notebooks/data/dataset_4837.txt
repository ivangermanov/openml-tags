Loan Default Prediction 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is part of the regression on both numerical and categorical features benchmark. The original dataset comes from the Loan Default Prediction Imperial College London challenge. 

The data consists of financial transactions associated with individuals, which have been standardized, de-trended, and anonymized. There are over two hundred thousand observations, each independent from the previous one, and nearly eight hundred features. For each observation, it was recorded whether a default was triggered, and if so, the loss was measured. This quantity lies between zero and one hundred, normalized considering that the notional of each transaction at inception is one hundred. For instance, a loss of sixty means that only forty is reimbursed. If the loan did not default, the loss was zero.

Competitors are asked to predict the losses for each observation in the test set. Missing feature values have been kept as they were, allowing teams to implement their own strategy to fill the gaps if desired. Some variables might be categorical, such as occupation or industry type. The competition sponsor has removed time dimensionality from the data; however, the observations are still listed in chronological order from oldest to newest.
