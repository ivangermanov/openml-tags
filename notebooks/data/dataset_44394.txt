Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD IPUMS LA Ninety Seven Small with seed equal to two, arguments number of rows max equal to two thousand, arguments number of columns max equal to one hundred, arguments number of classes max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows max, number of columns max, number of classes max, and stratified as parameters. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects a subset of columns using a uniform random choice. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. Finally, it returns a dataset with the selected data and columns.
