QSAR-TID-10849 Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK Three. 

Features represent FCFP One Thousand Twenty Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
