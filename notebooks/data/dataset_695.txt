Tecator Dataset

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features related to absorbance, which is a measure of the amount of light absorbed by a sample. These features are important in chemistry and life sciences, particularly in studying the properties of molecules and their interactions.

The Tecator dataset is useful for myth-busting and studying various concepts in chemistry and life sciences. It provides a valuable resource for researchers and students to explore and analyze the relationships between different variables.

Features:
Absorbance values at multiple wavelengths
