QSAR-TID-48 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mineralocorticoid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mineralocorticoid Receptor. The data has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Mineralocorticoid Receptor is a Single Protein with the Preferred Name Mineralocorticoid Receptor and Synonyms MCR, Mineralocorticoid Receptor, MLR, NR3C2, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 2. It is a Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily 3/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 2.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015.
