**Link Bayesian Network**

The Link Bayesian Network is a discrete very large network repository referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository.

This network consists of a total number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the network are notable. Additionally, the maximum in-degree of the network is also remarkable.

The network was originally used for linkage analysis in large pedigrees with many loops.

Features of this network include various node labels, although some of these labels may not be easily interpretable.
