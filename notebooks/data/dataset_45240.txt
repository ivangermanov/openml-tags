**Link Bayesian Network. Sample 10.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete very large network.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, while the average degree is moderate. The maximum in-degree is also moderate.

The network is characterized by its large size and complexity, making it a challenging problem for Bayesian network inference.

The network has been used as a benchmark for testing the performance of Bayesian network inference algorithms.

**Features:**

The network has a wide range of features, including node and arc properties, that are important for Bayesian network inference.
