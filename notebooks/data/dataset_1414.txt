The QSAR-TID-100843 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data, which shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase II Alpha. This dataset has sixteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Fingerprints, also known as FCFP, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is essential to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.

Casein Kinase II Alpha is a single protein, also known as Ack Two, which is an enzyme that belongs to the Other Protein Kinase group and the CK Two family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation, and regulation of cell cycle.
