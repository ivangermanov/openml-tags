Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand Challenge

Tags: Bike sharing, Demand prediction, Machine learning competition

This dataset is a modified version of the training data from the Bike Sharing Demand challenge hosted on Kaggle. The challenge focuses on predicting bicycle rental demand based on various environmental and temporal factors. The original dataset was sourced from a bike sharing system and has been adapted for use in this machine learning competition.

The dataset includes features such as date and time information, seasonal data, holiday and working day indicators, weather conditions, temperature measurements, humidity levels, wind speed, and the number of bike rentals. These features provide a comprehensive set of variables that can be used to analyze and predict bike sharing demand patterns.

This challenge offers an opportunity for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to develop models that can accurately forecast bicycle rental demand based on historical data and environmental factors. The dataset's rich feature set allows for exploration of various predictive techniques and the development of insights into the factors influencing bike sharing usage.
