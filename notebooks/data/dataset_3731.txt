Welcome to Sigma Cab Private Limited, a cab aggregator service that allows customers to download their app on smartphones and book a cab from anywhere in the cities they operate in. They, in turn, search for cabs from various service providers and provide the best option to their clients across available options.

They have been in operation for some time now, during which they have captured surge pricing type data from the service providers. As a data scientist, I have been tasked with building a predictive model that could help them predict the surge pricing type proactively. This would, in turn, help them match the right cabs with the right customers quickly and efficiently.

The following variables are defined:

Trip ID refers to the unique identifier for each trip, which cannot be used for modeling purposes. Trip Distance represents the distance for the trip requested by the customer. Type of Cab represents the category of the cab requested by the customer. Customer Since Months indicates how many months the customer has been using cab services, with zero indicating the current month. Lifestyle Index is a proprietary index created by Sigma Cabs that shows the lifestyle of the customer based on their behavior. Confidence Lifestyle Index represents the category showing confidence on the index mentioned above. Destination Type refers to Sigma Cabs' categorization of destinations into fourteen categories. Customer Rating represents the average lifetime rating of the customer until date. Cancellation Last One Month indicates the number of trips canceled by the customer in the last month.

The predictor variable, Surge Pricing Type, can take three types of values.
