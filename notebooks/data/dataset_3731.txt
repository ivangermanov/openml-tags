QSAR-TID-43 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 43. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1577 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor is a single protein, also known as ADRB2, ADRB2R, B2AR, Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor, and Beta-2 Adrenoceptor. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a Small Molecule Receptor. It is involved in the Monoamine Receptor and Adrenergic Receptor pathways.

The receptor is targeted by various compounds, including Reproterol, Bambuterol, Levobunolol, Carmoterol, and Pirbuterol, which are all Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor agonists or antagonists.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, diet-induced thermogenesis, and smooth muscle contraction. It is also involved in signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathways, and adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways.
