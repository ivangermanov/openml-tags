**Mercury in Bass**

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset illustrates the use of basic statistical methods to analyze the factors influencing mercury contamination in largemouth bass.

The study examined fifty-three different Florida lakes to investigate the relationship between water quality and mercury levels in fish. Water samples were collected from the surface of each lake during two periods: August 1990 and March 1991. The pH level, chlorophyll content, calcium levels, and alkalinity of each sample were measured.

In addition to water quality measurements, a sample of fish was taken from each lake, with sample sizes ranging from four to forty-four fish. The age of each fish and the mercury concentration in its muscle tissue were recorded. Since older fish tend to have higher mercury concentrations due to absorption over time, the researchers used a regression estimate of the expected mercury concentration in a three-year-old fish as a standardized value for each lake. However, in ten of the fifty-three lakes, the age of individual fish could not be determined, so the average mercury concentration of the sampled fish was used instead.

The dataset consists of various variables, including:

Lake identification number
Lake name
Alkalinity (measured in milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate)
pH level
Calcium levels (measured in milligrams per liter)
Chlorophyll content (measured in milligrams per liter)
Average mercury concentration (measured in parts per million) in the muscle tissue of the fish sampled from each lake
Number of fish sampled from each lake
Minimum mercury concentration among the sampled fish
Maximum mercury concentration among the sampled fish
Regression estimate of the mercury concentration in a three-year-old fish from each lake (or average mercury concentration if age data was unavailable)
Indicator of the availability of age data on fish sampled
