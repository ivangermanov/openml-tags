QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median activity values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a serine/threonine protein kinase known as Sgk or serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase. This single protein target is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the AGC protein kinase SGK family within the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase classification. It is associated with various cellular components including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and cytosol.

The protein exhibits numerous molecular functions such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and regulation of potassium and sodium channels. It is involved in biological processes including regulation of cell growth, protein phosphorylation, response to oxidative stress, intracellular signal transduction, and regulation of cell population proliferation.

This kinase is referenced in multiple databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and the Guide to Pharmacology. It has several associated Gene Ontology terms related to its cellular localization, molecular functions, and biological processes. The protein is also listed in resources such as Pharos, Reactome, and PharmGKB, indicating its relevance to pharmacological research.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship studies, potentially aiding in drug discovery efforts targeting this kinase. Researchers can utilize this data to develop predictive models for compound activity against the target protein.
