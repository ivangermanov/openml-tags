Breast Dataset Information

Additional Information:
Impedance measurements of freshly excised breast tissue were made at various frequencies, including fifteen point six twenty-five kilohertz, thirty-one point twenty-five kilohertz, sixty-two point five kilohertz, one hundred twenty-five kilohertz, two hundred fifty kilohertz, five hundred kilohertz, and one thousand kilohertz. These measurements, when plotted in the real versus negative imaginary plane, constitute the impedance spectrum from which breast tissue features are computed.

The dataset can be utilized for predicting the classification of either the original six classes or of four classes by merging together the fibroadenoma, mastopathy, and glandular classes, whose discrimination is not deemed crucial as they cannot be accurately discriminated.

Has Missing Values?: No

Additional Variable Information:

* Impedivity at Zero Frequency: This variable represents the impedance value at zero frequency.
* Phase Angle at Five Hundred Kilohertz: This variable denotes the phase angle measured at five hundred kilohertz.
* High-Frequency Slope of Phase Angle: This feature captures the rate of change of the phase angle at higher frequencies.
* Impedance Distance Between Spectral Ends: This variable calculates the distance between the start and end points of the impedance spectrum.
* Area Under Spectrum: This feature computes the total area beneath the impedance spectrum curve.
* Area Normalized by Impedance Distance: This variable normalizes the area under the spectrum by dividing it by the impedance distance between spectral ends.
* Maximum of the Spectrum: This feature identifies the highest point on the impedance spectrum curve.
* Distance Between Impedivity at Zero Frequency and Real Part of Maximum Frequency Point: This variable measures the distance between the impedance value at zero frequency and the real part of the maximum frequency point.
* Length of the Spectral Curve: This feature calculates the total length of the impedance spectrum curve.
Class:
The class labels include carcinoma, fibroadenoma, mastopathy, glandular, connective, and adipose tissues.
