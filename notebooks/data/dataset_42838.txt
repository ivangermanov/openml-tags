Breast Dataset

Tags: Partial Label Ranking

Features: Impedivity at Zero Frequency, Phase Angle at Five Hundred Kilohertz, High-Frequency Slope of Phase Angle, Impedance Distance between Spectral Ends, Area under Spectrum, Area Normalized by Impedance Distance, Maximum of the Spectrum, Distance between Impedivity at Zero Frequency and Real Part of the Maximum Frequency Point, Length of the Spectral Curve

Scraped Data: Dataset Information

Additional Information: Impedance measurements were made at various frequencies. These measurements, plotted in the real and imaginary plane, constitute the impedance spectrum from which breast tissue features are computed. The dataset can be used for predicting the classification of either the original six classes or of four classes by merging together the fibroadenoma, mastopathy, and glandular classes, whose discrimination is not important, as they cannot be accurately discriminated anyway.

Has Missing Values? No

Additional Variable Information: The dataset contains various features, including impedivity at zero frequency, phase angle at five hundred kilohertz, high-frequency slope of phase angle, impedance distance between spectral ends, area under spectrum, area normalized by impedance distance, maximum of the spectrum, distance between impedivity at zero frequency and real part of the maximum frequency point, and length of the spectral curve. The class labels include carcinoma, fibroadenoma, mastopathy, glandular, connective, and adipose tissue.
