AutoUniv is an advanced data generator for classification tasks, aiming to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. It allows users to generate data in various formats, including CSV, ARFF, and C4.5.

The dataset title is AutoUniv Dataset, which is specifically designed for data problem au6-1000. This dataset provides a unique way to generate classified examples from a created classification model.

To create a model, users need to specify several parameters, including the number of attributes and their type, either discrete or continuous, as well as the number of classes. Additionally, users can adjust the complexity of the underlying rules and the noise level to tailor the model to their specific needs.

AutoUniv uses a process of constrained randomized search to produce a model that satisfies the user's requirements. The resulting model can have up to a certain number of rules. Moreover, rare class models can be designed, and a sequence of models can be created to reflect concept and/or population drift.

For each model, AutoUniv generates three text files: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples, a user-friendly statement of the classification rules in an if-then format, and a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate.

Attributes in the dataset may be either discrete with multiple values or continuous. Discrete attributes can be nominal with specific values or integer with incremental values.

This dataset is particularly useful for modeling the example life cycle in online classification learners, as well as studying the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift.
