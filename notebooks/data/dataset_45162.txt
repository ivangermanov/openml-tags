**Mildew Bayesian Network**

This network is a part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which provides a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education. The Mildew network has thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in a total of five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters.

The network's structure reveals an average Markov blanket size of approximately four point five seven, indicating the complexity of relationships between variables. Furthermore, the average degree of the nodes is around two point six three, suggesting a moderate level of connectivity among the variables. The maximum in-degree of the nodes is three, implying that some variables have multiple parents.

This network was designed to model the influence diagram for management of mildew in winter wheat, which is a critical issue in agriculture. It represents various factors affecting the growth and yield of wheat crops, including microclimate, leaf area index, temperature, radiation, and precipitation.

The network features a range of variables, including microclimate, leaf area index, temperature, radiation, and precipitation, among others. These variables interact with each other in complex ways, influencing the growth and yield of wheat crops.
