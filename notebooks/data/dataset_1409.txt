QSAR-TID-100857 Dataset Information:

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand eight hundred fifty-seven, and it has an unspecified number of rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
