Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

The dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was accomplished by calculating the mean value of the original target feature and using that as a threshold. Instances falling below this threshold were classified as positive, while those above were classified as negative.

The binary classification is represented by 'P' for positive cases and 'N' for negative cases. This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques to the dataset.

The original source and date of creation for this dataset are not specified, which may limit the ability to provide proper attribution or context for its use. Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and the potential implications for analysis and interpretation of results.
