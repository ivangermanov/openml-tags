The BNG (lymph) dataset is an artificial dataset focused on lymphatic system characteristics and abnormalities. It encompasses various features related to lymph node structure, function, and pathological changes. These features include lymphatic system components, blockages in afferent vessels and lymph cells, bypass mechanisms, extravasation processes, regenerative capabilities, and early uptake patterns. The dataset also considers lymph node size variations, structural alterations, and special morphological forms. Additionally, it accounts for node dislocation, exclusion, and quantitative aspects such as the number of nodes involved in specific conditions. This comprehensive collection of lymphatic system attributes allows for in-depth analysis and classification of lymphatic disorders and abnormalities.
