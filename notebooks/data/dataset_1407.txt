This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one thousand one hundred eighty-eight, and it has three thousand eight hundred eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically study number three, and contains information about the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p thirty-eight alpha.

This enzyme is also known as Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase fourteen, CSAID-binding protein, CSBP, CSBP one, CSBP two, CSPB one, and other synonyms. It belongs to the protein family of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases and is involved in various biological processes such as cell morphogenesis, cartilage condensation, angiogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and placenta development.

The enzyme is also involved in negative regulation of inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, glucose metabolic process, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, transcription by RNA polymerase two, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, chemotaxis, DNA damage response, and signal transduction.
