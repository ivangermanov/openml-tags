Glass Classification Tags: Context

This is a Glass Identification Data Set from UCI, containing ten attributes, including an identification number, which has been removed from the CSV file. The response variable is the type of glass, which has seven discrete values. 

The attributes include refractive index, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, barium, and iron, all measured in weight percent in corresponding oxide. 

The type of glass is the class attribute, which can be one of the following: building windows float processed, building windows non-float processed, vehicle windows float processed, vehicle windows non-float processed, containers, tableware, or headlamps.

Data exploration of this dataset reveals two important characteristics. Firstly, the variables are highly correlated with each other, including the response variable. This suggests that a machine learning algorithm that can handle correlated variables, such as Random Forest, may be most suitable for this dataset. 

Secondly, the data is highly skewed. Scaling may be sufficient to normalize the data, but other techniques, such as Box-Cox power transformation, may also be necessary to achieve normality.
