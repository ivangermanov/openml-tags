Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, which has been transformed from its original numeric format into a binary classification task. The conversion process involved calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This modification allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem, potentially offering new insights or approaches to analysis.

The dataset is associated with various studies and a mythbusting theme, suggesting it may have been used to challenge or verify certain hypotheses or commonly held beliefs within its domain. The exact nature of these studies and the specific myths being addressed are not detailed in the provided information.

The features of the dataset are labeled as 'oz' followed by numbers one through ten, with an additional binary class feature. These features likely represent different measurements or attributes relevant to the problem being studied, though their exact meanings are not specified in the given description.

Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, acknowledging its binarized nature and its derivation from an earlier, non-binary version of the data.
