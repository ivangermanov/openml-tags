This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification results in a binary outcome. 

The dataset includes several features, including ozone one, ozone two, ozone three, ozone four, ozone five, ozone six, ozone seven, ozone eight, ozone nine, and ozone ten, which are relevant to the chemistry and life science domains.
