QSAR-TID-10548 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10548. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset contains a total of one thousand and one hundred rows and one thousand and twenty-six features.

The drug target TID: 10548 is a C-C chemokine receptor type three, which is a single protein target. It is also known as CCR three and is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including chemotaxis, inflammatory response, and immune response.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and can be used to develop predictive models for CCR three activity. The data can be used to identify new compounds with potential CCR three activity and to optimize existing compounds for better activity.
