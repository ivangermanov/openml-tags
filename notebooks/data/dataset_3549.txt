This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101521, belongs to the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101521. There are fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset shows activity values in units of pseudo-pCI fifty of several compounds on drug target Complement Factor B, also known as BF or BFD, which is an enzyme belonging to the serine protease family. It plays a crucial role in the alternative pathway of the complement system, which is part of the innate immune system.

Complement Factor B is a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including the immune system process, proteolysis, and response to bacteria. It is also involved in the regulation of the complement cascade and the positive regulation of immune responses.

The dataset is related to the study of the structure and function of Complement Factor B, which is essential for understanding its role in the immune system and its potential as a drug target. The development of inhibitors of Complement Factor B, such as iptacopan, may lead to new treatments for diseases related to the immune system.

Keywords: QSAR, Complement Factor B, drug target, innate immune system, proteolysis, immune response.
