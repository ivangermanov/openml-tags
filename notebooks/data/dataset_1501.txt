Semeion Handwritten Digit Data Set

Tags: OpenML-CC, OpenML, study, uci

Dataset Description:
The Semeion Handwritten Digit Data Set comprises handwritten digits scanned and documented from approximately individuals. Each of the variables describe one of the pixels and their corresponding values, providing a comprehensive representation of the handwritten digits.

Sources:
This dataset was created by Tactile Srl, Brescia, Italy and generously donated to Semeion Research Center of Sciences of Communication, Rome, Italy, for the purpose of machine learning research. For inquiries, interested parties may contact the Semeion Research Center.

Dataset Information:
A substantial collection of handwritten digits from numerous individuals were meticulously scanned and processed. The images were stretched to fit a rectangular box in a grayscale format. Subsequently, each pixel was converted to a boolean value using a predetermined threshold. Participants were instructed to write all digits from zero to nine twice: once with careful accuracy and once rapidly without emphasis on precision. The recommended validation protocol for this dataset is a cross-validation approach, with a portion dedicated to training and testing, and the remainder reserved for completely blind validation.

Attribute Information:
The dataset consists of numerous records, with each record representing a distinct handwritten digit. The original scanned images underwent a series of transformations, including stretching, scaling, and conversion to binary format. The final representation of each digit is a square box of binary attributes, providing a standardized format for analysis and machine learning applications.

Relevant Papers:
A notable paper discussing the theoretical framework related to this dataset has been published in a substance use and misuse journal, focusing on the concept of independent judges in data analysis.
