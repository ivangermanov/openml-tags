The QSAR-TID-11811 dataset is a collection of QSAR data related to the activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 11811. This dataset contains fifty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and class features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project, specifically from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows the activity values of various compounds on the specified drug target, which is a crucial step in the development of new medications.

The drug target in question is the C-C chemokine receptor type one, also known as CC chemokine receptor. It belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors and is primarily involved in the process of chemotaxis.

This receptor is classified under the category of single protein targets and is specifically expressed in the Mus musculus species group. Its preferred name is C-C chemokine receptor type one, and it has various synonyms.

In terms of its cellular component, this receptor is primarily located in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, external side of the plasma membrane, membrane, and neuronal cell body. Its molecular function includes phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C activity, G-protein coupled receptor activity, chemokine receptor activity, protein binding, C-C chemokine receptor activity, C-C chemokine binding, and chemokine ligand seven and five bindings.

Its biological processes involve calcium ion transport, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, exocytosis, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, cell-cell signaling, negative regulation of gene expression, calcium-mediated signaling, myeloid cell differentiation, positive regulation of cell migration, negative regulation of bone mineralization, leukocyte chemotaxis, positive regulation of osteoclast differentiation, negative regulation of innate immune response, positive regulation of calcium ion transport, cell chemotaxis, chemokine-mediated signaling pathway, and positive regulation of ERK one and two cascades.
