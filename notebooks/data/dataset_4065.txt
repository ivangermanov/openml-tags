Isolet Tags: Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark

This dataset belongs to the "Regression on Numerical Features" benchmark.

Original Description:

The Isolet dataset was generated as follows: one hundred fifty subjects spoke the name of each letter of the alphabet twice. Hence, there are fifty-two training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of thirty speakers each, four groups can serve as the training set, and the last group as the test set. A total of three examples are missing, which were dropped due to difficulties in recording. 

This is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task. It is also a very good domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms. For example, C4.5 on this domain is slower than backpropagation!

Source:
The Isolet dataset was created by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Oregon Graduate Institute.

Attributes Information:
All attributes are continuous, real-valued attributes scaled into the range negative one point zero to one point zero. The features include spectral coefficients, contour features, sonorant features, pre-sonorant features, and post-sonorant features. 

Relevant Papers:
Spoken letter recognition and error-correcting output codes are relevant topics related to this dataset.
