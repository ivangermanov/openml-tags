QSAR-TID-100907 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100907. The dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September 2015. The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type-1A is a single protein that is also known as Activin Receptor-Like Kinase Three, ALK Three, ALK-Three, BMPR1A, and other synonyms. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TKL protein kinase group/TKL protein kinase STKR family/TKL protein kinase STKR Type One subfamily.

The protein is expressed in Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein. It has a description relationship accession of P36894.

The protein has several functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase activity, transforming growth factor beta receptor activity, type one, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, BMP binding, protein homodimerization activity, ion binding, SMAD binding, and metal ion binding.
