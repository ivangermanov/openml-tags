This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand seven hundred seventy-three, and it has five hundred twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Machine learning is used to analyze this dataset, particularly in the field of manufacturing. It is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically study three.
