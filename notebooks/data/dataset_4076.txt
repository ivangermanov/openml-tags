QSAR-TID-10773 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10773. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 525 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The drug target is Interleukin-8 receptor B, also known as CD182, CDw128b, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2, CXCR2, CXC-R2. It is a single protein and a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including dendritic cell chemotaxis, acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, leukocyte chemotaxis, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, cellular defense response, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The receptor is also involved in various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory disorders.
