This dataset describes a telecommunication problem and is sourced from a collection of regression datasets. It originates from a commercial application detailed in a publication from 1995. The dataset comprises a substantial number of cases, each with numerous continuous attributes. Unfortunately, no further information about the specific nature of the telecommunication problem or the meaning of the attributes is available.

The dataset is part of a larger collection of regression datasets compiled and made available online. It can be accessed in its original format through a provided web link. The features of the dataset are represented by a series of alphanumeric codes, ranging from f1 to f48, with an additional feature labeled as foo.

This dataset presents an opportunity for researchers and data scientists to work with a real-world telecommunication problem, despite the limited contextual information. The large number of cases and attributes make it suitable for various regression analysis techniques and machine learning applications in the field of telecommunications.
