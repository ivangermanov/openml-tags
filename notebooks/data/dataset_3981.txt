QSAR-TID-10183 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Somatostatin Receptor Four, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP Six One Hundred Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX Fifty. 

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September Two Thousand Fifteen. 

It includes QSAR data from ChEMBL version Seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Somatostatin Receptor Four. 

Somatostatin Receptor Four is a single protein also known as Somatostatin Receptor Type Four, SS Four R, SS Four, and SST Four. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens. Its protein target classification is One Point Membrane Receptor Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor Peptide Receptor Family A GPCR Short Peptide Receptor Family A GPCR Somatostatin Receptor. 

Somatostatin Receptor Four has multiple functions including G protein-coupled receptor activity, somatostatin receptor activity, protein binding, and neuropeptide binding. It participates in various biological processes such as signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, cell migration, forebrain development, and somatostatin signaling pathway.
