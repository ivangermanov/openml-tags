QSAR-TID-11868 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CTK, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CTK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CTK is also known as CHK, CSK Homologous Kinase, CTK, Hematopoietic Consensus Tyrosine-Lacking Kinase, HYL, and other synonyms. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and TK protein kinase group, specifically a tyrosine protein kinase Csk family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is available for research and development purposes, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
