This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CTK, also known as CHK, CSK Homologous Kinase, CTK, Hematopoietic Consensus Tyrosine-Lacking Kinase, and HYL. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CTK is a single protein preferred name, also known as CHK, CSK Homologous Kinase, CTK, Hematopoietic Consensus Tyrosine-Lacking Kinase, and HYL. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TK protein kinase group, and tyrosine protein kinase Csk family. It is a megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine-protein kinase.

The dataset contains information about the expression atlas, gene ontology component, gene ontology function, gene ontology process, and Wikipedia information about the target. Additionally, it includes information about canSAR-target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
