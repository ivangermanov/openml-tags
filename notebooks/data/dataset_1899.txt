This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12679, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint one, fingerprint two, fingerprint three, and so on up to fingerprint one hundred twenty-four.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September two thousand fifteen.
