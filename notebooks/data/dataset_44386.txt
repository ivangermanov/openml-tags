Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters such as a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to use stratification or not, and returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable and selects a specified maximum number of classes using uniform sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data based on these indices.

If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uniformly samples the columns to reduce their number. The selected column indices are stored and used to subset the data.

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to reduce their number while maintaining class balance. The resulting subsampled data is returned as a new dataset along with its categorical mask and column names.
