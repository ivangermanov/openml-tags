This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as negative, denoted by 'N'. 

The dataset contains twenty-five features, including oz one through oz twenty-five, as well as a binary class feature.
