Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set (see version). It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset includes numerous features labeled as oz followed by numbers. These features are likely measurements or attributes related to the regression problem being studied.

Binary Class: The target variable has been converted to a binary classification, with instances labeled as either positive ('P') or negative ('N') based on their relation to the mean of the original numeric target.

This dataset appears to be designed for studying binary classification problems derived from regression data. It may be useful for researchers investigating the effects of binarizing continuous variables or comparing regression and classification approaches on the same underlying data.
