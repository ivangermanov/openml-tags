The Libras dataset is a collection of data related to partial label ranking, featuring a wide range of attributes. The dataset contains ninety features, which are numeric and represented as double values, and one feature for the class, which is an integer value. 

The dataset is comprised of fifteen classes, each containing twenty-four instances, where each class refers to a specific hand movement type in Libras. In the video pre-processing stage, a time normalization is carried out, selecting forty-five frames from each video according to a uniform distribution. In each frame, the centroid pixels of the segmented objects, which are the hands, are found, composing the discrete version of the curve F with forty-five points. All curves are normalized in the unitary space.

To prepare these movements for analysis by algorithms, a mapping operation is performed, where each curve F is mapped into a representation with ninety features, representing the coordinates of movement. Some sub-datasets are offered to support comparisons of results.

The dataset does not contain any missing values.
