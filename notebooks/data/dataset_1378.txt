This dataset, known as BNG (Letter), is an artificial dataset tagged with BNG. It contains various features related to geometric and spatial characteristics of letters. These features include measurements of bounding boxes (Xbox and Ybox), dimensional attributes (width and height), pixel density (on pixels), and various bar measurements along different axes (X Bar, Y Bar, X Second Bar, Y Second Bar, XY Bar, X Second Y Bar, XY Second Bar). Additionally, it incorporates edge-related features (X Edge, Y Edge) and comparative edge measurements (X Edge Versus Y, Y Edge Versus X). The dataset also includes a class feature, likely for categorization purposes.
