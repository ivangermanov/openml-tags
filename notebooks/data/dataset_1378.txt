QSAR-TID-136
Tags: Images, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Delta opioid receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identifiers, fingerprints, and median pXC50.

The Delta opioid receptor is a single protein, also known as Delta-type opioid receptor, D-OR-1, DOR-1, OPRD, and OPRD1. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and opioid receptor.

The Delta opioid receptor is involved in various biological processes, including immune response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. It is also associated with certain diseases and disorders, such as addiction and pain.

Several compounds have been identified as agonists or antagonists of the Delta opioid receptor, including axomadol, ADL-5859, ADL-5747, AZD-7268, and samidorphan. These compounds have undergone various phases of clinical trials and have shown potential therapeutic effects.
