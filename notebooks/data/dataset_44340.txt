**Meta Album Insects Dataset (Extended)**

The original Insects dataset is created by the National Museum of Natural History, Paris. It has a large collection of images in different sizes and orientations. The dataset has a hierarchical classification system, which includes Order, Super Family, Family, and Taxa. Each image features an insect in its natural environment or habitat, such as on a flower or near vegetation. The images are collected by researchers and hundreds of volunteers from the SPIPOLL Science project.

**Dataset Details**

The dataset is a preprocessed version of the original Insects dataset, where images are carefully cropped from either side to make squared images. These cropped images are then resized into 128x128 using Open-CV with an anti-aliasing filter.
