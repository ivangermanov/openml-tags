Title: USP zero five FT: Software Effort Estimation at Feature Level

Source Information: The donor of this data set is the Computer Science Department at the University of Calgary, Canada.

Past Usage: This data set has been used in several studies, including a flexible method for effort estimation by analogy, which was published in Empirical Software Engineering, and a comparative study of attribute weighting heuristics for effort estimation by analogy, which was presented at the ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering.

Relevant Information: This data set was part of USP zero five, which was collected from university student projects about web and client-server applications. The detailed description of the whole data set can be found in the referenced publication.

Number of Instances: There are seventy-six instances, or features, in this data set.

Number of Attributes: There are fifteen attributes, including an identifier, effort, and thirteen other attributes that describe various aspects of the software development process.

Attribute Information: Each instance is described by fifteen attributes, including an identifier, the actual effort in hours expended on tasks related to implementing the object, complexity of internal calculation, number of data files or database tables accessed, number of data entry items, number of data output items, unadjusted function point count, language used, development tools and platforms, language and tool experience level, applications experience level, team size, database systems, methodology, and type of system or application architecture.

Missing Attribute Values: There are thirty-seven missing attribute values in this data set.

Data Features: The data features include identifier, effort, complexity of internal calculation, number of data files or database tables accessed, number of data entry items, number of data output items, unadjusted function point count, language used, development tools and platforms, language and tool experience level, applications experience level, team size, database systems, methodology, and type of system or application architecture.
