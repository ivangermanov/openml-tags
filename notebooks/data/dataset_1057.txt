Title: USP05-FT: Software effort estimation at feature level

This data set was part of USP05 that was collected from university student projects about Web and client/server applications. The detailed description of the whole data set can be found in the referenced literature.

The data set contains instances of features with various attributes including effort, complexity, data files accessed, data entry items, data output items, unadjusted function point count, programming language used, development tools and platforms, language and tool experience level, applications experience level, team size, database systems, methodology, and type of system/application architecture.

The attributes cover a wide range of factors that can influence software development effort, such as the complexity of internal calculations, the number of data files or database tables accessed, the number of data entry and output items, the programming language and tools used, the experience level of the team, and the type of system architecture.

This data set provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners interested in software effort estimation, particularly at the feature level. It can be used to develop and evaluate predictive models for estimating the effort required to implement specific software features based on various project and team characteristics.
