The Snapchat Google Play Store Reviews dataset contains reviews from the Google Play Store on Snapchat. With sentiment analysis, we can examine the users' adoption of the Android version of Snapchat, which has undergone significant improvements recently, as claimed by the company. This analysis can also help determine whether the app is redefining the use of the camera and changing the way people interact with their close ones. The dataset features include the date of the review, the user's rating, the number of users who found the review helpful, and the text of the review itself.
