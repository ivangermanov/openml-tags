The QSAR-TID-12114 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12114. This dataset has one hundred thirty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and nine hundred ninety-five other features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.

The scraped data includes information about the protein target, which is a single protein preferred name Receptor-type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase F, also known as LAR. It is a leukocyte common antigen-related protein. The organism is Homo sapiens and the species group is not applicable. The protein target classification is enzyme/phosphatase/protein phosphatase/tyrosine protein phosphatase/receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase.

The description of the protein target is a receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase that is involved in various cellular processes, including protein dephosphorylation, cell adhesion, and neuronal development.

The expression atlas shows that this protein is expressed in various tissues, including brain, heart, and lung. The component ontology shows that it is located in the plasma membrane, membrane, neuron projection, and neuronal cell body. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein dephosphorylation, cell adhesion, and neuronal development.

The function ontology shows that it has various molecular functions, including phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, heparin binding, hydrolase activity, and phosphatase activity.
