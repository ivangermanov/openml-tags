QSAR-TID-102576 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero two five seven six, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero two five seven six. The data has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September two thousand fifteen. The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero two five seven six. The data has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is related to UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. UniProt has one accession, InterPro has three relationships, and Pfam has one relationship.
