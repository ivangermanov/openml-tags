The Andromeda dataset is a multivariate regression data set that concerns the prediction of future values for six water quality variables in the Thermaikos Gulf of Thessaloniki, Greece. These variables include temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, oxygen, and turbidity. Measurements of the target variables are taken from underwater sensors with a sampling interval, and then averaged to get a single measurement for each variable over each day. 

The specific dataset used here corresponds to using a window of days and a lead of days. This means that the features attributes correspond to the values of the six water quality variables up to days in the past, and we predict the values of each variable days ahead.

The dataset includes features such as window attributes, which are not human-readable. 

The target variables include temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, oxygen, and turbidity.
