Machine Learning Dataset: Helena 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Helena dataset, which has been reduced in size to facilitate machine learning model training and testing. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns from the original dataset, while ensuring that the resulting dataset remains representative of the original.

The subsampling process began by selecting classes uniformly at random, with the goal of retaining a maximum number of classes. This was done to ensure that the resulting dataset retains a good representation of the original class distribution. Next, columns were selected uniformly at random, with the goal of retaining a maximum number of columns. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and facilitate faster model training and testing.

Once the classes and columns had been selected, the dataset was further reduced in size by sampling rows uniformly at random. This was done to reduce the overall size of the dataset, making it more manageable for machine learning models. Throughout the subsampling process, stratification was used to ensure that the resulting dataset retains a good representation of the original class distribution.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, which have been carefully selected to retain a good representation of the original dataset.
