Grass grubs are one of the major insect pests of pasture in Canterbury and can cause severe pasture damage and economic loss. Pastoral damage may occur periodically over wide-ranging areas. Grass grub populations are often influenced by biotic factors (diseases) and farming practices (such as irrigation and heavy rolling). The objective of the report was to report on grass grub population and damage levels to provide objective estimates of the annual losses caused by grass grubs. The original machine learning objective was to find a relationship between grass grub numbers, irrigation, and damage ranking for the period between the late eighties to early nineties.

Attribute Information:
- Year zone: Years divided into three zones: foothills, midplain, coastal
- Year: year of trial
- Strip: strip of paddock sampled
- Paddock: paddock sampled
- Damage rank RJT: damage ranking
- Damage rank ALL: other researchers' damage ranking
- Dry or irrigated: indicates if paddock was dry or irrigated (Dryland, Irrigated overhead, Irrigated border dyke)
- Zone: position of paddock (Foothills, Midplain, Coastal)
- Grass grubs new: based on grass grubs per metre squared
