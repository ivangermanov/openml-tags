Law School Admission Dataset 

Tags: Computational Universe, Life Science 

This dataset is based on a survey conducted among students attending law school in the United States. The dataset was obtained from the R package fairml. In this dataset, the response variable has been transformed into a binary format, specifically whether an individual's undergraduate grade point average is greater than three. Furthermore, the race category has been binarized into two distinct labels: White and Non-White.

The dataset comprises various features, including the student's age, decile rankings, family income, Law School Admission Test scores, undergraduate grade point average, gender, racial category, cluster assignments, full-time enrollment status, and bar passage results.
