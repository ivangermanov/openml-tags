Subsampling of the dataset Christine with seed equals zero arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals True. 

Generated with the following source code: 

The function subsample takes in self, seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and stratified as parameters. It returns a dataset. 

First, it sets up a random number generator with the given seed. Then, it gets the features and target from the dataset. 

It uniformly samples classes from the target. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes based on their frequency in the target. 

It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates the features and target accordingly. 

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the maximum number of columns randomly. 

After that, it checks if the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows. If so, it stratifies the data accordingly and splits it into a subset of the maximum number of rows. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string for OpenML, creates a new dataset with the updated features, target, categorical mask, and columns, and returns it.
