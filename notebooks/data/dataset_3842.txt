The QSAR-TID-12413 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12413. This dataset has sixty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI50.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12413.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12413.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is an identifier for each molecule, and the median pseudo-pCI50 is the activity value of each compound.

The fingerprints are molecular descriptors that characterize the structure of each molecule. They are used to predict the activity of each compound.

This dataset is useful for predicting the activity of new compounds on drug target TID: 12413.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecule, fingerprint, SMILES, activity value, prediction.
