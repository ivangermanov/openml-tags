QSAR-TID-12413 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12413. The dataset has sixty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the chemical structure of compounds.

The features in the dataset are primarily composed of molecular fingerprints, which are binary vectors that encode the presence or absence of specific substructures in a molecule. These fingerprints are used as inputs to machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a valuable resource for building and testing QSAR models.
