QSAR-TID-101460 Dataset: Economics, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101460. It has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
