The QSAR-TID-10364 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10364. This dataset has sixty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Alpha two B Adrenergic Receptor, also known as Adra two B, Alpha two B Adrenoceptor, Alpha two B Adrenoreceptor, and Alpha two BAR.

The Alpha two B Adrenergic Receptor is a single protein, preferred name, with synonyms including Adra two B, Alpha two B Adrenoceptor, Alpha two B Adrenoreceptor, and Alpha two BAR. It belongs to the species group Rattus norvegicus, and its protein target classification is one point Membrane receptor slash Family A G protein-coupled receptor slash Small molecule receptor family A GPCR slash Monoamine receptor slash Adrenergic receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, angiogenesis, regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle contraction, regulation of smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, female pregnancy, regulation of vasoconstriction, platelet activation, activation of protein kinase B activity, receptor transactivation, positive regulation of MAPK cascade, positive regulation of neuron differentiation, positive regulation of blood pressure, and positive regulation of uterine smooth muscle contraction.

It is also involved in the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway and adenylate cyclase-activating adrenergic receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, it has been annotated in various databases, including canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
