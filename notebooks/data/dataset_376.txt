The SyskillWebert-Sheep dataset is a collection of HTML sources of web pages along with their corresponding ratings given by a single user. The web pages fall into four distinct categories - Bands (recording artists), Goats, Sheep, and Biomedical. Each user viewed fifty to one hundred pages within a specific domain and rated them on a three-point scale - hot, medium, or cold.

The goal of this dataset is to predict user ratings for web pages within a particular subject category. The accuracy of rating predictions has been reported in earlier publications, while later studies employed metrics such as precision at top N or the F-measure.

This dataset does not contain any missing values. It features include the ID and text of the web page, along with its class label.
