Please cite: Syskill and Webert Web Page Ratings

This database contains the HTML source of web pages plus the ratings of a single user on these web pages. The web pages are on four separate subjects: Bands (recording artists), Goats, Sheep, and BioMedical. The HTML source of a web page is provided. Users examined each web page and indicated their preference on a three point scale (hot, medium, cold) for fifty to one hundred pages per domain. This approach is realistic because the goal is to learn user profiles from as few examples as possible, providing users with an incentive to rate pages. The primary challenge is to predict user ratings for web pages within a specific subject category. Early publications reported on the accuracy of predicting ratings, while later publications utilized precision at top N or the F measure.

The dataset includes the HTML source of web pages along with user ratings. Users evaluated each page on a three point scale ranging from hot to cold, covering fifty to one hundred pages per domain. This approach aims to learn user preferences efficiently, encouraging user participation in rating pages. The main objective is to predict how users will rate web pages within particular subject areas. Initial research focused on rating prediction accuracy, with subsequent studies employing metrics such as precision at top N and the F measure to evaluate performance.

Features include identification, text content, and classification. The HTML source code for each web page is provided in the dataset. Users assessed web pages across various domains, assigning ratings on a scale from hot to cold. This method is designed to create user profiles with minimal input, motivating users to engage in the rating process. The central task involves forecasting user ratings for web pages within specific categories. Research progressed from examining prediction accuracy to utilizing more sophisticated evaluation metrics.
