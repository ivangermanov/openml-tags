Wine Dataset Tags: Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the Classification on Numerical Features benchmark. Original source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wine Quality Dataset. Please give credit to the original source if you use this dataset.

This dataset contains various features of wine, including acidity levels, sugar content, and chemical composition, which are used to predict the quality of the wine. The features include acidity levels, such as fixed acidity and volatile acidity, as well as citric acid and residual sugar content. Additionally, the dataset includes measures of chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, and total sulfur dioxide, which are important indicators of wine quality. The dataset also includes measures of density and pH levels, which can affect the taste and overall quality of the wine. Furthermore, the dataset includes sulphates and alcohol content, which are important factors in determining the quality of the wine. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to predict the quality of the wine based on these numerical features.
