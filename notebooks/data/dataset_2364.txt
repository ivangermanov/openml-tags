Spoken Arabic Digit Dataset 

Tags: Abstract 

This dataset contains time series of mel frequency cepstrum coefficients corresponding to spoken Arabic digits. It includes data from eighty-eight native Arabic speakers, forty-four males and forty-four females, who were asked to repeat each digit ten times. 

Source 
The data was collected by the Laboratory of Automatic and Signals, University of Badji-Mokhtar Annaba, Algeria.

Data Set Information 
The dataset consists of eight thousand eight hundred time series of thirteen frequency cepstral coefficients had taken from eighty-eight Arabic native speakers to represent ten spoken Arabic digits.

Attribute Information 
Each line on the database represents thirteen mel frequency cepstral coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame. The thirteen mel frequency cepstral coefficients were computed with the following conditions: sampling rate of eleven thousand twenty-five hertz, sixteen bits window applied, hamming filter pre-emphasized.
