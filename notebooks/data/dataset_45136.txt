**Child Bayesian Network. Sample Five.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a valuable resource for this dataset.

This Child Bayesian Network consists of twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three, and the average degree is two point five. The maximum in-degree is two.

This dataset is a representation of a probabilistic expert system, which is a type of system that deals with uncertainty and incomplete information.

The network features several variables, including the distribution of hypoxia, duct flow, cardiac mixing, disease, lung flow, and CO2 report, among others.
