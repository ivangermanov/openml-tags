The Child Bayesian Network is a sample network that has been widely used in the field of machine learning and life science research. This network repository contains twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with two hundred thirty parameters and an average Markov blanket size of three. The average degree of the network is two point five, with a maximum in-degree of two.

This network was developed to model the complex relationships between various factors related to childhood disease diagnosis. It takes into account a range of variables, including age, symptoms, test results, and medical history. By analyzing these factors, the network can provide insights into the likelihood of different diseases and help medical professionals make more accurate diagnoses.

Some of the key variables included in the network are age, disease symptoms, lung function, cardiac mixing, and oxygen levels. The network also incorporates the results of various medical tests, such as chest x-rays and co2 reports.
