The DNA dataset is a collection of 3,186 data points, each representing a splice junction in a DNA sequence. The data points are described by 180 binary indicator variables, which are used to recognize three classes: exon-intron boundaries (ei), intron-exon boundaries (ie), and neither. The dataset is a processed version of the original Irvine database, where symbolic variables representing nucleotides (A, C, G, and T) were replaced by three binary indicator variables. This transformation changed the original 60 symbolic attributes into 180 binary attributes. The names of the examples were removed, and examples with ambiguities were also removed.

The dataset was produced as part of the StatLog project, and it is a widely used benchmark for machine learning algorithms. The main difference between the StatLog version and the original Irvine database is the replacement of symbolic variables with binary indicator variables. This transformation allows for easier processing and analysis of the data.

The dataset consists of 180 features, each representing a binary indicator variable. These features are used to describe the DNA sequence and recognize the boundaries between exons and introns. The features are arranged in a specific order, with the attributes closest to the junction being the most informative.

Using attributes closest to the junction is generally recommended, as they provide more information about the boundary between exons and introns. In the StatLog version, this means using attributes sixty-one to one hundred twenty only.
