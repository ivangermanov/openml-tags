QSAR-TID-100863 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100863. The dataset has three hundred fifty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

Features include molecule chembl id, fingerprint features, and median pxc fifty.
