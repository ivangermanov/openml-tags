Tags: Drug design, Molecular descriptors, Structure-activity relationships

This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset contains information related to quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for various chemical compounds. It includes data on molecular descriptors, physicochemical properties, and biological activities of different molecules. The original studies cover a wide range of topics such as melting point prediction, ligand binding to receptors, toxicity assessment, and biodegradability of chemical compounds.

The dataset incorporates information from multiple sources, including journal articles and books on medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and chemometrics. It encompasses diverse chemical classes like carbolenes, benzodiazepines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and halogenated compounds.

The features in the dataset are generated using specialized software and represent various molecular properties and descriptors. These may include topological indices, electronic parameters, geometric features, and other calculated properties that can be used to predict or model the behavior of chemical compounds.

This compilation of data is valuable for researchers working on drug design, toxicology, environmental chemistry, and related fields. It allows for the development and validation of predictive models for various endpoints of interest in pharmaceutical and chemical research.
