The sulfur recovery unit, which plays a crucial role in removing environmental pollutants from acid gas streams before they are released into the atmosphere, also recovers elemental sulfur as a valuable byproduct.

This dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in the same way as the other datasets in the tabular data benchmark.

The sulfur dataset has five input variables related to gas and air flows. The two output variables to be predicted are Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide concentrations.

For more information about this dataset, refer to the appendix of Soft Sensors for Monitoring and Control of Industrial Processes.
