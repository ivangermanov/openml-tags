Description:
This dataset contains information on one hundred plant species leaves, focusing specifically on leaf margin characteristics. The data was collected from leaf samples at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, United Kingdom. The original dataset includes binary images (masks) of the leaf samples, though the color images are not provided.

Dataset Information:
The dataset comprises three main features for each leaf image: shape, margin, and texture. Each feature is represented by a sixty four element vector per leaf sample. These vectors are either contiguous descriptors (for shape) or histograms (for texture and margin). The data file provided here focuses on the margin feature.

Each row in the dataset contains a sixty four element feature vector followed by the class label. There are one thousand six hundred samples in total, with sixteen samples per leaf class across one hundred classes. The dataset is complete with no missing values.

Attributes Information:
The dataset consists of three sixty four element feature vectors per sample, representing different aspects of the leaf characteristics.

Relevant Papers:
Several papers have been published utilizing this dataset, focusing on plant leaf classification using various features including shape, texture, and margin characteristics. These studies have employed techniques such as probabilistic integration, gabor co occurrences, and combined shape and texture analysis for classification purposes.

The dataset has applications in botanical research, plant species identification, and computer vision tasks related to leaf classification. It provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners working on plant recognition systems and leaf based classification algorithms.
