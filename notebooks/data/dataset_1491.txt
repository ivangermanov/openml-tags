The One Hundred Plants Margin dataset is classified under the tags Chemistry, Life Science, and OpenML100. This dataset was sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI).

The description of this dataset is that it contains one hundred plant species leaves data set, specifically focusing on the margin of the leaves.

The sources of this dataset include the original owners of the color leaves samples, who collected the leaves at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK.

This dataset provides information about the leaves, including their shape, texture, and margin features. Each feature is represented by a sixty-four element vector per leaf sample, which are taken as a contiguous descriptor for shape or histograms for texture and margin. There are three separate files, each corresponding to a specific feature problem: data based on shape, data based on texture, and data based on margin.

Each row in the dataset contains a sixty-four-element feature vector followed by the class label. There are a total of sixteen hundred samples, with sixteen samples per leaf class, and no missing values.

The attributes of this dataset include three sixty-four element feature vectors per sample.

Relevant papers related to this dataset include Plant Leaf Classification Using Probabilistic Integration of Shape, Texture and Margin Features, Plant Texture Classification Using Gabor Co-Occurrences, and Shape and Texture-Based Plant Leaf Classification.
