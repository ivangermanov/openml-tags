The purpose of this dataset is to predict poker hands.

Data Set Information:
Each record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of fifty-two. Each card is described using two attributes, suit and rank, for a total of ten predictive attributes. There is one class attribute that describes the poker hand. The order of cards is important, which is why there are many possible royal flush hands as compared to only four, one for each suit.
