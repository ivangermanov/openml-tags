The River Flow dataset concerns the prediction of river network flows for forty-eight hours in the future at specific locations. The dataset contains data from hourly flow observations for eight sites in the Mississippi River network in the United States and were obtained from the US National Weather Service. Each row includes the most recent observation for each of the eight sites as well as time-lagged observations from six, twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-eight, and sixty hours in the past. In RF1, each site contributes eight attribute variables to facilitate prediction. There are a total of sixty-four variables plus eight target variables.

The RF2 dataset extends the RF1 data by adding precipitation forecast information for each of the eight sites, expected rainfall reported as discrete values. For each observation and gauge site, the precipitation forecast for six-hour windows up to forty-eight hours in the future is added. The two datasets both contain over a year of hourly observations collected from September to September. The domain is a natural candidate for multi-target regression because there are clear physical relationships between readings in the contiguous river network.
