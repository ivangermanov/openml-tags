Robot Execution Failures Data Set

Abstract:
This data set contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

Data Set Information:
The donation includes five data sets, each of which defines a different learning problem. The five learning problems include failures in approach to grasp position, failures in transfer of a part, position of part after a transfer failure, failures in approach to ungrasp position, and failures in motion with part.

To improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies was defined and evaluated. These strategies were based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, and other methods. This enabled an average improvement of twenty percent in accuracy.

Attribute Information:
All features are numeric, although they are integer-valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection. Each failure instance is characterized in terms of fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection. The total observation window for each failure instance was three hundred fifteen milliseconds. 

Relevant Papers:
Feature Transformation Strategies for a Robot Learning Problem was published in Feature Extraction, Construction and Selection. A Data Mining Perspective. Integration and Learning in Supervision of Flexible Assembly Systems was published in IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation.
