Robot Failures LP Dataset

Tags: mf less than, study, study, study, study

This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

The dataset includes multiple subsets, each defining a different learning problem:

- Failures in approach to grasp position
- Failures in transfer of a part
- Position of part after a transfer failure
- Failures in approach to ungrasp position
- Failures in motion with part

To improve classification accuracy, several feature transformation strategies were defined and evaluated, based on statistical summary features and discrete Fourier transform. This enabled a significant improvement in accuracy.

All features are numeric, though integer-valued. Each feature represents a force or torque measured after failure detection. Failure instances are characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular intervals immediately after failure detection. The total observation window for each failure instance was milliseconds.

Examples are described with class and force/torque measurements (Fx, Fy, Fz, Tx, Ty, Tz) at multiple time points, resulting in a total of features.

The dataset originates from research in robot learning at the task level, particularly in the assembly domain. It has been used in studies on feature transformation strategies for robot learning problems and integration of learning in supervision of flexible assembly systems.

This dataset provides valuable information for researchers working on robotic systems, particularly in areas of failure detection, task learning, and assembly operations. The multiple learning problems and feature transformation strategies offer opportunities for developing and testing various machine learning approaches in the context of robotic applications.
