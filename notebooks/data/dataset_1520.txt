QSAR-TID-100854 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, molecular fingerprints, and median pseudo pCI50.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase is a single protein also known as hMELK, hPK38, KIAA0175, and belongs to the species Homo sapiens. It is classified under enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK1 family/CAMK protein kinase MELK subfamily.

It is expressed in cytoplasm, plasma membrane, cell cortex, and membrane. Its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity, calcium ion binding, protein binding, ATP binding, lipid binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

Its biological processes include G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, cell cycle, cell population proliferation, intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to oxidative stress, phosphorylation, hemopoiesis, intracellular signal transduction, positive regulation of apoptotic process, protein autophosphorylation, and neural precursor cell proliferation.
