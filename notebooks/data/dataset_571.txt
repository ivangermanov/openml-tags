This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The classification results in two distinct classes: Positive and Negative. This process allows for a more straightforward analysis of the data. The dataset includes various features, including the Year and the Group.
