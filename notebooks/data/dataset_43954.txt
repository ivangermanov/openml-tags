Covertype Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark.

Original description: This dataset was retrieved from the LibSVM repository. Please cite the original source for the binarization.

This is the famous Covertype dataset in its binary version. The dataset was created by loading the original Covertype dataset, unscaled, and then normalizing each file column-wise according to the following rules: if a column only contains one value, it is set to zero and thus removed by sparsity; if a column contains two values, the value occurring more often is set to zero, and the other is set to one; if a column contains more than two values, the column is divided by its standard deviation. Duplicate lines were finally removed.

Preprocessing involved transforming the dataset from multiclass into binary class.
