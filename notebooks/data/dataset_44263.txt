Title of Database: Annealing Data

This dataset contains information about the annealing process of various materials.

The database contains 38 attributes, including six continuously valued, three integer-valued, and 29 nominal-valued attributes.

Attribute Information:

* Family: Various families of materials, including GB, GK, GS, TN, ZA, ZF, ZH, ZM, and ZS.
* Product Type: Three types of products, namely C, H, and G.
* Steel: Different types of steel, including R, A, U, K, M, S, W, and V.
* Carbon Content: Continuous valued attribute representing the percentage of carbon in the material.
* Hardness: Continuous valued attribute representing the hardness of the material.
* Temper Rolling: Whether the material has undergone temper rolling or not.
* Condition: The condition of the material, which can be one of several options.
* Formability: A rating of the material's formability on a scale of one to five.
* Strength: Continuous valued attribute representing the strength of the material.
* Non-Ageing: Whether the material is non-ageing or not.
* Surface Finish: The type of surface finish, which can be one of several options.
* Surface Quality: A rating of the material's surface quality on a scale of D, E, F, or G.
* Enamelability: A rating of the material's enamelability on a scale of one to five.
* Blue/Bright/Varnish/Clean: Whether the material has undergone any of these processes or not.
* Lustre: Whether the material has a lustre or not.
* Jurofm: Whether the material meets certain standards or not.
* S and P: Two separate attributes indicating whether certain conditions are met or not.
* Shape: The shape of the material, which can be either coil or sheet.
* Thickness, Width, and Length: Continuous valued attributes representing the dimensions of the material.
* Oil: Whether the material has been oiled or not.
* Bore: The diameter of the material's bore, which can be one of several options.
* Packing: A rating of the material's packing on a scale of one to three.

Classes:
The database contains five classes, namely one, two, three, four, five, and U.
