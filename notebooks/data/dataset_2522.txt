The primary objective of this challenge is to introduce the research community to real-world datasets of significant interest to Four Paradigm. All datasets have been uniformly formatted, despite varying in terms of their inherent nature. In order to facilitate participant focus on classification tasks, the data has been preprocessed into matrices; however, participants are more than welcome to employ additional feature extraction methodologies, as long as they adhere to the rules and regulations outlined for the challenge.

Each problem presented constitutes a binary classification task, which shall be evaluated using the Normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The identities of the datasets, as well as their inherent data types, have been concealed; however, their structural composition has been revealed. The final score in the second phase shall be calculated as the average ranking across all testing datasets, thereby generating a comprehensive ranking system to determine the winners.

In order to maintain a level playing field, each code submission shall be executed within a predetermined time constraint. The Codalab platform provides shared computational resources, comprising two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, forty gigabytes of solid-state drive storage, and an Ubuntu operating system. This ensures fair evaluation of submissions, wherein execution time is strictly limited.

Features include class labels, alongside twenty-two variables, namely Class, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twenty-One, and Twenty-Two.
