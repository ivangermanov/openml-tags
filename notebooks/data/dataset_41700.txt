This is an extension of the Pre Marshalling dataset that includes more features and a set of test instances. There are three sets of features: the full set of features from the latent feature analysis process, a reduced set of features from the first iteration of the latent feature analysis process, and the original features used in the previous dataset. 

The features for the Pre Marshalling Problem are all extremely easy and fast to compute, thus the feature costs file has been omitted, as it would be time zero for every feature regardless of using original, first iteration, or full features. The feature computation code is available online.

The dataset contains instance id, repetition, stacks, tiers, stack to tier ratio, container density, percentage of empty stacks, percentage of overstowing stacks, percentage of overstowing two container stacks, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of groups with the same characteristics, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of top good containers, percentage of overstowage, bottom floor left behind, left density, tier weighted groups, average L1 top left large group, containers empty greater than estimated stack, percentage of bottom percentage on top, algorithm, runtime, and run status.
