Subsampling of the dataset Albert with a random seed, resulting in a subset of the original data. This subsampled dataset has been generated with the following parameters: the maximum number of rows has been set, the maximum number of columns has been limited, and the maximum number of classes has been restricted. Additionally, the stratification of the data has been taken into account during the subsampling process.

The original dataset has been uniformly sampled to select a subset of classes, and then the indices where one of these classes is present have been selected. The columns have also been uniformly sampled if required, and the resulting dataset has been stratified accordingly.

The dataset features a selection of variables, including variables one through seventy eight, and a class variable.
