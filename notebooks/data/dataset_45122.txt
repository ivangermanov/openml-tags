**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample 2.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education. The Barley Bayesian Network is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides".

The network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree of the network is four.

This Bayesian network is a model for barley production, focusing on the factors that influence the quality and yield of barley. It is a complex system, with many variables interacting and influencing each other.

The network features a range of variables, including protein content, sort size, and nitrogen levels, among others.
