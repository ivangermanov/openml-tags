**Data Description**

This is the historical price data of the Foreign Exchange Australian Dollar/New Zealand Dollar from Dukascopy. One instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans a specific date range and does not include weekends, as the Foreign Exchange market is not traded on weekends.

The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the Close Bid and the Close Ask of the following day, relative to the Close Bid and Close Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean Close price is increasing the following day, and false when the mean Close price is decreasing or remains the same the following day.
