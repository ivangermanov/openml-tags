Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Age, Civil, Can/US, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Disclosure Z, is a modified version of an original dataset. The primary transformation involves converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization process effectively turns a regression problem into a two-class classification task.

The dataset includes several features, such as Age, Civil status, and a Can/US indicator, along with the newly created binary class feature. This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques to what was originally a continuous target variable problem.

Researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification, feature engineering, or comparative studies between regression and classification approaches may find this dataset particularly useful. The binarization process exemplifies a common technique in data preprocessing and problem reformulation in machine learning and statistical analysis.
