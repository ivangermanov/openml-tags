This dataset is part of a collection of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are generated using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target variable.

The datasets cover various aspects of drug design and molecular modeling, including melting point prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), and biodegradability prediction. They encompass a wide range of chemical compounds such as carbolenes, benzodiazepines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and protein kinase inhibitors.

The data sources include journal articles from medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and toxicology fields. These studies explore topics such as molecular diversity, pharmacological evaluation, and the development of predictive models for biological activity and physicochemical properties.

Some datasets focus on specific chemical classes or biological targets, while others investigate broader applications of molecular descriptors and statistical methods in predictive toxicology and drug discovery. The research spans various modeling approaches, including linear regression, artificial neural networks, and multivariate pattern recognition techniques.

The datasets provide valuable resources for researchers studying structure-property and structure-activity relationships, as well as those developing new computational methods for drug design and chemical informatics.
