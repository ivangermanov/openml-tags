Subsampling of the Helena dataset with a seed value. This dataset was generated with the following source code.

The subsample function takes in a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean value. It returns a dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes using a random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of each class. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns using a random choice.

Finally, the function samples rows accordingly. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, it uses a train test split with stratification based on the target variable.

The resulting dataset is then returned with the selected features, target variable, and categorical mask.
