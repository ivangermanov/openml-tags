This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one seventy-four, and it has two thousand twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September two thousand fifteen.

Preferred name is estrogen receptor beta. Synonyms include ER-beta, ESR two, ESTRB, estrogen receptor beta, NR three A two.

Organism is homo sapiens. Species group is no protein target classification. One transcription factor nuclear receptor nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three group A nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three group A member two.

Description relationship accession estrogen receptor beta single protein.

Target classification one transcription factor nuclear receptor nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three group A nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three group A member two.
