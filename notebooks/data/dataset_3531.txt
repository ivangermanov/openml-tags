QSAR-TID-174 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Estrogen Receptor Beta, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Estrogen Receptor Beta. Estrogen Receptor Beta is a single protein and its preferred name is Estrogen Receptor Beta. It has synonyms such as ER-beta, ESR2, ESTRB, Estrogen Receptor Beta, and NR3A2. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and its protein target classification is Transcription factor/Nuclear receptor/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three group A/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three group A member two.

The dataset has multiple features including MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
