The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

These datasets are among the most widely used functions for data generation, as they include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, along with a normalized noise added to the output.

The Friedman function includes five features for input and is defined as: output equals ten times sine of pi times input one times input two plus twenty times input three minus point five squared equals ten times input four plus five times input five plus error.

To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features were added to the datasets, which are independent from the output. Furthermore, to evaluate the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets were generated with varying collinearity degrees. Collinearity degree refers to the number of features dependent on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are as follows: the number of features varies, with only the first five features being related to the output, while the remaining ones are completely random; the number of samples also varies; and collinearity degrees range from zero to four.

For datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features was generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. Consequently, eighty artificial datasets were generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file represents the target.
