The background to the datasets is described in a specific section; this file relates the computer-readable files to that description.

Viruses: This dataset contains information on viruses with rod-shaped particles that affect various crops including tobacco, tomato, cucumber, and others. The dataset comprises measurements on each virus, specifically the number of amino acid residues per molecule of coat protein. The viruses are organized in the following order: Hordeviruses, Tobraviruses, Tobamoviruses, and 'furoviruses'. These categories were added as the last (target) attribute.

Features: The dataset includes multiple columns representing various measurements related to the viruses' amino acid composition. The final feature indicates the virus type.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying the molecular structure and classification of plant-affecting viruses. It offers insights into the amino acid composition of viral coat proteins across different virus families and their potential impact on various crops. The data can be utilized for pattern recognition and neural network analyses in the field of virology and plant pathology.
