**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex Australian Dollar/Singapore Dollar exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one hourly candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January to December and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is closed during these periods. The timestamp feature is based on the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent hour relative to the current hour's mean high price. In other words, if the mean high price is expected to increase in the next hour, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.

**Note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions. Realistic trade strategies require predicting Close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.**
