QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Ephrin type A receptor, also known as EEK, EK, EPHA, EPH and ELK related kinase, EPH like kinase. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Eph family classification.

The Ephrin type A receptor is associated with various cellular components including endosomes, plasma membranes, dendrites, and neuron projections. Its functions encompass nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, tyrosine kinase activity, ATP binding, and growth factor binding. The receptor is involved in numerous biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, cell migration, cell adhesion, axon guidance, neuron remodeling, and regulation of cell adhesion mediated by integrin.

This protein is referenced in multiple databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is associated with several Gene Ontology terms related to its cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. The Ephrin type A receptor plays crucial roles in nervous system development, MAPK cascade regulation, and ephrin receptor signaling pathways.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship studies, potentially aiding in drug discovery and development targeting the Ephrin type A receptor.
