QSAR-TID-30010 

Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Physical Sciences, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30010, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, followed by multiple fingerprint features.

The dataset was scraped from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains information about the Ephrin type-A receptor eight, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, description, relationship, accession, and gene ontology components, functions, processes, and other related information.
