Name: Analcatdata Apnea

Tags: Mythbusting, Study

Source: Unknown - Date unknown

Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Automatic, Scorer Two, Subject, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Apnea, is a modified version of an original dataset with an unknown source and publication date. The primary modification involves binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This conversion is achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset includes features such as Automatic, Scorer Two, Subject, and Binary Class, which may be relevant to the study of sleep apnea or related conditions. The tags associated with this dataset suggest its potential use in mythbusting and various studies, indicating its versatility in research applications.
