This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen.

Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha is a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as Alpha Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor, Alpha-Type Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor, CD one hundred forty a Antigen, and CD one hundred forty Antigen-Like Family Member A.

It belongs to the Enzyme Kinase Protein Kinase Tyrosine Protein Kinase PDGFR family and is classified as a protein target.

The protein is involved in various biological processes such as luteinization, in utero embryonic development, cell activation, hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, protein phosphorylation, chemotaxis, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

It is also involved in positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, estrogen metabolic process, female gonad development, anatomical structure morphogenesis, animal organ morphogenesis, negative regulation of platelet activation, and positive regulation of phospholipase C activity.

The protein has various cellular components such as nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, microvillus, cilium, external side of plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, cell junction, protein-containing complex, and receptor complex.

It has molecular functions such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor activity, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activity, platelet-derived growth factor receptor binding, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, growth factor binding, vascular endothelial growth factor binding, and protein homodimerization activity.
