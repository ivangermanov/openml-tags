QSAR-TID-12627 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha is a single protein and a preferred name for the target. It has synonyms such as Alpha Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor, Alpha-Type Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor, CD140a Antigen, CD140 Antigen-Like Family Member A, and CD Antigen equals CD140a.

The target is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase, and PDGFR family. It is involved in various biological processes, including luteinization, in utero embryonic development, cell activation, hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, protein phosphorylation, chemotaxis, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

The target is also involved in various cellular components, including nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, microvillus, cilium, external side of plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, cell junction, protein-containing complex, and receptor complex.
