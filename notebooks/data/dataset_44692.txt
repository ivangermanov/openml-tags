Name: Wine Quality White

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Wine Quality White with seed four, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the Wine Quality White dataset. It takes in a seed value, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample. 

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum number of columns. 

Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the sample according to the target variable, ensuring that the sample is representative of the original dataset.
