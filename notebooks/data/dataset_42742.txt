The Porto Seguro dataset is a training dataset from the Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction Kaggle challenge. The goal of this challenge is to predict whether a driver will file an insurance claim in the next year. According to the official rules of the challenge, the data can be used for academic research and education, as well as other non-commercial purposes.

For a detailed description of all variables, please refer to the Kaggle dataset repository. It is worth noting that numeric features with integer values that do not contain "bin" or "cat" in their variable names are, in fact, ordinal features, which could be treated as ordinal factors in R.

For further information on effective preprocessing and feature engineering, please check out the Kernels section of the Kaggle challenge website. Many participants in the challenge removed all "calc" variables as they do not seem to carry much information.

The dataset features include the target variable, as well as various individual and vehicle-related features, such as ps_ind_01, ps_ind_02 category, ps_ind_03, and so on. There are also several ps_reg and ps_car features, which are related to the region and car, respectively.
