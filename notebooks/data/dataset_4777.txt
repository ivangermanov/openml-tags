Solar Flare Tags: **Data Description**

The Solar Flare dataset aims to predict the number of common solar flares based on various characteristics of active regions on the sun. This dataset contains three classes, each representing the frequency of a specific type of solar flare occurring within a twenty-four-hour period.

**Attribute Description**

The dataset includes thirteen attributes that describe different aspects of active regions on the sun. These attributes are:

Class, which represents the modified Zurich classification; Largest Spot Size, which codes for the size of the largest spot; Spot Distribution, which codes for the distribution of spots; Activity, which indicates whether the region's activity is reduced or unchanged; Evolution, which describes the region's evolution as either decaying, not growing, or growing; Previous Activity, which codes for the level of flare activity in the preceding twenty-four-hour period; Complex, which indicates whether the region is historically complex; Complex Path, which indicates whether the region became historically complex during its passage across the sun's disk; Area, which categorizes the region's size as small or large; Area of the Largest Spot, which measures the area of the largest spot; and finally, the target features: C-Class Flares, M-Class Flares, and X-Class Flares, which represent the number of common, moderate, and severe flares produced by the region in the subsequent twenty-four hours, respectively.
