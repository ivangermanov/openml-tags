QSAR-TID-10696 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10696. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1070 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase AKT3, also known as Protein Kinase Akt-3 or Protein Kinase B Gamma. It is a single protein and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase AKT family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including mitochondrial genome maintenance, positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and phosphorylation. It is also involved in the regulation of cell size, cell migration, and angiogenesis.

The protein has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and has been targeted by several small molecule inhibitors.
