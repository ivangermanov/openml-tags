QSAR-TID-10696 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10696. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature, representing FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA, and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 1024 bits.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September 2015.

Scraped Data:

The preferred name of the target protein is Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase AKT Three, also known as AKT Three PKBG PKB Gamma Protein Kinase Akt-Three Protein Kinase B Gamma. 

The protein belongs to the species Homo sapiens, classified under the enzyme kinase protein kinase AGC protein kinase group AGC protein kinase AKT family.

Description:

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including mitochondrial genome maintenance, positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and phosphorylation.

It is also involved in multiple molecular functions, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, and transferase activity.

Expression Atlas shows one record, while Go Component lists three components, including nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane. 

Go Function lists eight functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

Go Process lists seventeen processes, including mitochondrial genome maintenance, positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, phosphorylation, and multiple others.
