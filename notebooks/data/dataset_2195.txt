QSAR-TID-194 Dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 194. The dataset has multiple rows and features including molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It has multiple applications in computer systems, machine learning, and multi-task learning QSAR.

Coagulation Factor X is a single protein target also known as activated factor Xa heavy chain, factor X heavy chain, and factor X light chain. It belongs to the serine protease PA clan and the serine protease S1A subfamily.

Coagulation Factor X is involved in various biological processes including proteolysis, blood coagulation, hemostasis, and positive regulation of cell migration. It also plays a role in the extrinsic pathway of fibrin clot formation, intrinsic pathway of fibrin clot formation, and common pathway of fibrin clot formation.

This protein target has multiple synonyms including activated factor Xa heavy chain, coagulation factor X, factor X heavy chain, and factor X light chain. It is classified under the enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily category.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, multi-task learning, coagulation factor X, serine protease, biological processes, fibrin clot formation.
