Fri C Two is a binarized regression problem dataset in the field of Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset consists of various features, including Oz One, Oz Two, up to Oz Fifty, which are used to predict the binary class.

This dataset is related to Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, and Study Eighty-Eight.
