Breast Cancer Gene Expression - CuMiDa

Tags: Dataset GSE45827 on Breast Cancer Gene Expression from CuMiDa, Six Classes, Fifty-Four Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-Six Genes, One Hundred Fifty-One Samples

The Curated Microarray Database, CuMiDa, is a repository containing seventy-eight handpicked cancer microarray datasets, extensively curated from thirty thousand studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus, solely for machine learning. The aim of CuMiDa is to offer homogeneous and state-of-the-art biological preprocessing of these datasets, together with numerous three-fold cross-validation benchmark results to propel machine learning studies focused on cancer research. The database makes available various download options to be employed by other programs, as well as for Principal Component Analysis and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding results.

CuMiDa stands out from existing databases for offering newer datasets, manually and carefully curated, from sample quality, unwanted probes, background correction, and normalization, to create a more reliable source of data for computational research.
