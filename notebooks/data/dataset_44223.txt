Diabetes Dataset
-----------------

The Diabetes dataset contains ten baseline variables, including age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, which were obtained for each of the diabetes patients. Additionally, the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, was also recorded.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

* The dataset consists of a total of instances.
* The dataset has a total of attributes, where the first ten columns represent numeric predictive values.
* The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, which is represented in the eleventh column.
* Attribute Information:
  * Age represents the patient's age in years.
  * Sex represents the patient's gender.
  * Body Mass Index (BMI) represents the patient's body mass index.
  * Average Blood Pressure represents the patient's average blood pressure.
  * Total Serum Cholesterol represents the patient's total serum cholesterol level.
  * Low-Density Lipoproteins represent the patient's low-density lipoprotein level.
  * High-Density Lipoproteins represent the patient's high-density lipoprotein level.
  * Total Cholesterol/HDL represents the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein.
  * Log of Serum Triglycerides Level represents the logarithm of the patient's serum triglyceride level.
  * Blood Sugar Level represents the patient's blood sugar level.

Note that each of these ten feature variables has been mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the square root of the number of samples. This means that the sum of squares of each column totals one.
