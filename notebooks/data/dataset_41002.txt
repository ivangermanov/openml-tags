This dataset, known as Jungle Chess Two Pieces Endgame Rat Panther, is part of a collection of datasets based on the game Jungle Chess, also referred to as Dou Shou Qi. For a detailed description of the rules, please refer to the accompanying paper. The paper also provides an explanation of the various constructed features.

As the tablebases are a disjoint set of several tablebases based on which two pieces are on the board, we have uploaded all tablebases that have explicit different content. These include Rat versus Rat, Rat versus Panther, Rat versus Lion, Rat versus Elephant, Panther versus Lion, Panther versus Elephant, Tiger versus Lion, Lion versus Lion, Lion versus Elephant, Elephant versus Elephant, Complete, which is a combination of the above, and RAW Complete, which is a combination of the above, containing only the rank, file, and strength information for both pieces.

This dataset presents a similar classification problem to, for example, the King and Rook versus King problem and is therefore suitable for classification tasks. Note that this dataset is one of the aforementioned datasets. Additionally, note that several subproblems are very similar, and having seen a given position from one of the tablebases arguably gives a lot of information about the outcome of the same position in the other tablebases.

Features include:

* White piece zero strength
* White piece zero file
