Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: symboling, normalized losses, make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, peak rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, price, binary class

This dataset, known as AutoHorse, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified two-class classification problem. The process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive, while those above were labeled as negative. This transformation allows for easier analysis and application of binary classification algorithms. The dataset encompasses a wide range of automotive characteristics, including various physical dimensions, engine specifications, and performance metrics. These features provide a comprehensive view of different automobile attributes, enabling researchers and data scientists to explore relationships between vehicle characteristics and the binary classification outcome.
