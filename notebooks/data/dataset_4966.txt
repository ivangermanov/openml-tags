**Hailfinder Bayesian Network**

The Hailfinder Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex model.

The Hailfinder network has been designed to forecast severe weather conditions, and it takes into account various factors that contribute to hail formation.

The network structure comprises multiple nodes and arcs, which represent the relationships between different variables. The average Markov blanket size indicates the complexity of the relationships between the variables.

This Bayesian network is a powerful tool for predicting severe weather events, including hailstorms. It has been developed using a comprehensive approach, taking into account multiple factors that influence weather patterns.
