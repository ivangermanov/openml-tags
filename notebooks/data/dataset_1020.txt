Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi class target feature is converted to a two class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes labeled as "att" followed by numbers, ranging from att to att. The final feature is labeled as binaryClass.

The mfeat karhunen dataset is a modified version of an original multi-class dataset, where the target feature has been transformed into a binary classification problem. This conversion was achieved by designating the majority class as positive and grouping all other classes as negative. The dataset likely contains various numerical attributes that serve as input features for the classification task. The binary nature of the target variable makes this dataset suitable for studying and evaluating binary classification algorithms and techniques.
