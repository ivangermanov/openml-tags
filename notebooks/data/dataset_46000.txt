Fly Craft Demonstrations

Tags: Demonstrations

This dataset features a collection of demonstrations generated by a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for Fly Craft. The demonstrations include a range of flight scenarios, showcasing the controller's ability to navigate and stabilize the aircraft.

The dataset includes a variety of features, such as:

* State timestamp, representing the time at which each state was recorded
* State roll, pitch, and yaw angles, describing the aircraft's orientation
* State velocity, representing the aircraft's speed
* State mu and chi values, related to the aircraft's movement and direction
* State p and h values, describing the aircraft's position and altitude
* Goal velocity, mu, and chi values, representing the desired flight trajectory
* Action p, nz, and pla values, corresponding to the control inputs applied to the aircraft
