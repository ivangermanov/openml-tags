QSAR TID Dataset

Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Somatostatin receptor type, also known as SRIF, SSR, SS R. This receptor belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the peptide receptor and short peptide receptor subgroups within the somatostatin receptor classification.

The somatostatin receptor is found in Rattus norvegicus and is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, neuropeptide signaling, spermatogenesis, cerebellum development, peristalsis, forebrain development, cellular responses to hormones and lipids, and the somatostatin signaling pathway.

Its molecular functions include G protein coupled receptor activity, somatostatin receptor activity, PDZ domain binding, and neuropeptide binding. The receptor is located in multiple cellular components such as the cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and neuron projections.

This receptor is associated with several database entries including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is involved in peptide ligand binding receptors and G alpha signaling events according to Reactome pathways.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship studies, particularly in the context of drug discovery and development targeting the somatostatin receptor system.
