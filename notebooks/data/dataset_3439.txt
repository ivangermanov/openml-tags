QSAR-TID-100912 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor TYRO3, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor TYRO3. The data has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September two thousand fifteen. The dataset should be cited as the source of the QSAR data.

The Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor TYRO3 is a single protein, also known as BYK, DTK, RSE, SKY, TIF, and other synonyms. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TK protein kinase group, and tyrosine protein kinase Axl family. The protein is found in Homo sapiens and is classified into a species group of no protein target.

The protein has multiple functions, including nucleotide binding, virus receptor activity, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and phosphatidylinositol three-kinase binding. It is involved in multiple biological processes, including neuron migration, natural killer cell differentiation, protein phosphorylation, phagocytosis, cell adhesion, signal transduction, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, spermatogenesis, nervous system development, phosphatidylinositol three-kinase signaling, phosphorylation, cell migration, forebrain cell migration, platelet activation, secretion by cell, positive regulation of kinase activity, negative regulation of toll-like receptor signaling pathway, substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading, ovulation cycle, apoptotic cell clearance, protein kinase B signaling, negative regulation of neuron apoptotic process, negative regulation of innate immune response, lymphocyte activation, viral entry into host cell, protein autophosphorylation, negative regulation of inflammatory response, negative regulation of lymphocyte activation, neuron apoptotic process, establishment of localization in cell, vagina development, neuron cellular homeostasis, platelet aggregation, and positive regulation of viral life cycle.
