**Electricity**

This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark. 

The Electricity dataset is a widely used dataset described and analyzed in various papers. This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market. In this market, prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to alleviate fluctuations. 

The dataset contains instances dated from May to December. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of thirty minutes, i.e., there are instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has fields, the day of the week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label. 

The class label identifies the change of the price in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours and removes the impact of longer-term price trends. The data was normalized.
