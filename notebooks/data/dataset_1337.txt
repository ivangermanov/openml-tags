This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand forty-four, and it has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty.

The features represent Fingerprints molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and many others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically the study number three.

The target of this dataset is Serine threonine protein kinase PAK seven, also known as KIAA twelve sixty-four, p twenty-one activated kinase five, p twenty-one activated kinase seven, PAK five, PAK hyphen five. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens.
