This dataset, named Phen, is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset is derived from various sources, including studies on carbolenes, melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro and bromoalkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, stability of purposely modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The studies cover a wide range of topics in medicinal chemistry, including drug design, molecular modeling, toxicology, biodegradability, and structure-activity relationships. They employ various computational and experimental methods to investigate the properties and behaviors of different chemical compounds and their interactions with biological systems.
