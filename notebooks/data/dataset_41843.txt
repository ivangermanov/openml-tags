**Data Description**
This is the historical price data of the Foreign Exchange Australian Dollar versus United States Dollar from Dukascopy. One instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one hour. The entire dataset spans a specific date range and does not include weekends, since the Foreign Exchange market is not traded on weekends.

The time zone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following hour, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is increasing in the following hour, and false when the mean High price is decreasing or remains unchanged in the following hour.

**Note** that this is a hypothetical task, intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trade strategies can only be applied to predictions based on Close attributes, which are also available.
