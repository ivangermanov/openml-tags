The QSAR-TID-18044 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Plasmepsin One, a single protein from the species group Plasmodium falciparum.

This dataset has been generated from ChEMBL version Seventeen and consists of One Hundred Thirteen rows and One Thousand Twenty-Six features, including molecule identifiers and class features. The features represent extended connectivity fingerprints, which were generated from simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The target protein, Plasmepsin One, is an aspartic hemoglobinase also known as Aspartic Hemoglobinase One, Plasmepsin One, Plasmepsin I, or PMI. It belongs to the enzyme/protease/aspartic protease/AA clan/aspartic protease A1A subfamily classification.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and acquisition of nutrients from the host. It is localized in the food vacuole and has aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.

Keywords: QSAR, Plasmepsin One, drug target, ChEMBL, extended connectivity fingerprints, SMILES, aspartic hemoglobinase, proteolysis, nutrient acquisition.
