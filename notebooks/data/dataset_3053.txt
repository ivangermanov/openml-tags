QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Plasmepsin, a single protein target also known as Aspartic hemoglobinase I, Plasmepsin I, and PMI. This enzyme is found in Plasmodium falciparum and belongs to the Aspartic protease AA clan, specifically the Aspartic protease AA subfamily. It is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Aspartic protease.

Plasmepsin is associated with various cellular components, including vacuoles, vacuolar membranes, vacuolar lumen, general membranes, food vacuoles, and cytostomes. Its molecular functions encompass aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. The biological processes it participates in include proteolysis and acquisition of nutrients from the host.

The protein is referenced in multiple databases, including canSAR-Target, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is associated with several Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to its cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and serves as a valuable resource for studying the activity of compounds on this specific drug target. Researchers can utilize this information for further analysis and drug discovery efforts targeting Plasmepsin in Plasmodium falciparum.
