QSAR-TID-19623 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19623. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, which is a protein target involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and immune response. The protein is a key player in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and is activated by lipopolysaccharide, a component of the bacterial cell wall.

The dataset provides a detailed description of the protein's structure, function, and interactions, including its role in the regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, immune system processes, and response to lipopolysaccharide. The dataset also includes information about the protein's expression, localization, and post-translational modifications.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases related to the Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1.
