Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: case number, number of days, status, drug, age, sex, day, presence of ascites, presence of hepatomegaly, presence of spiders, presence of edema, serum bilirubin, serum cholesterol, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, platelets, prothrombin time, binary class

This dataset represents a binarized version of an original medical dataset, focusing on a regression problem that has been converted into a binary classification task. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean value. This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a continuous prediction problem. The dataset includes various medical features related to patient characteristics, symptoms, and laboratory test results, which are used to predict the binary outcome.
