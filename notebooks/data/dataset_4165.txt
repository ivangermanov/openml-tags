Elevators

This dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark. It is part of the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same manner as the other datasets. 

The original dataset is derived from the task of controlling an F sixteen aircraft, although the target variable and attributes differ significantly from those found in the ailerons domain. In this particular instance, the goal variable is directly related to an action taken on the elevators of the aircraft.

Features include climb rate, vertical acceleration, roll, pitch, current roll, absolute roll, climb rate difference, roll rate difference, second order climb rate difference, time stamps for stick angle one through four, differences in stick angle time stamps one and three, and finally, stick angle.
