The Steel Plates Faults Data Set 

A dataset of steel plates' faults, classified into seven different types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition. This data set consists of twenty-seven features describing each fault, including location, size, and other characteristics, and one feature indicating the type of fault, which is one of seven categories: Pastry, Z Scratch, K Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, or Other Faults. The target is the type of fault.
