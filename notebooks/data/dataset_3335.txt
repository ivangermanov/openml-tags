QSAR-TID-11624 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11624. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 742 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

Caspase-1 is a single protein, also known as CASP1, CASP-1, Caspase-1, Caspase-1 subunit p10, Caspase-1 subunit p20. It is an enzyme, a protease, a cysteine protease, and a cysteine protease CD clan, specifically a cysteine protease C14 family.

Caspase-1 is involved in various biological processes, including pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway, proteolysis, apoptotic process, signal transduction, osmosensory signaling pathway, protein autoprocessing, positive regulation of interleukin-1 beta production, positive regulation of interleukin-18 production, defense response to bacterium, regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process, positive regulation of neuron apoptotic process, icosanoid biosynthetic process, regulation of inflammatory response, positive regulation of inflammatory response, protein maturation, defense response to virus, pyroptosis, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cellular response to mechanical stimulus, cellular response to organic substance, cellular response to type II interferon, positive regulation of release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, cytokine precursor processing, signaling receptor ligand precursor processing, AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly, positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway.

Caspase-1 is also involved in various molecular functions, including endopeptidase activity, cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, cysteine-type endopeptidase activator activity involved in apoptotic process, hydrolase activity, kinase binding, identical protein binding, CARD domain binding, caspase binding.
