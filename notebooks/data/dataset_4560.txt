Eucalyptus Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This is a subsampled version of the Eucalyptus dataset, which has been reduced to facilitate easier handling and analysis. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows.

The class selection process ensured that the resulting dataset retained a diverse range of classes, while the column sampling reduced the dimensionality of the data. The row sampling further reduced the size of the dataset, making it more manageable for analysis.

The resulting dataset retains the key characteristics of the original Eucalyptus dataset, including the relationship between variables such as Abbreviation, Replication, Locality, Map Reference, Latitude, Altitude, Rainfall, Frosts, Year, Species, Planting Material Certificate Number, Diameter at Breast Height, Height, Survival, Vigor, Insect Resistance, Stem Form, Crown Form, Branch Form, and Utility.
