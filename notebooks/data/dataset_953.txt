This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset originally consisted of multiple classes, but for the purpose of this study, they have been simplified into two categories. This conversion allows for a more straightforward analysis and comparison of the data.

The dataset contains several features, including attributes related to chemical properties and life science characteristics. These attributes have been carefully selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

The primary goal of this dataset is to facilitate research and analysis in the fields of chemistry and life science. By providing a simplified and binarized version of the original data, researchers can focus on identifying patterns and relationships between the different attributes.
