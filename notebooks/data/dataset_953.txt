Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: Instance name, various attributes, binary class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the target feature has been transformed from multiple classes into a binary classification problem. The majority class is labeled as positive, while all other classes are combined and labeled as negative. This binarization process simplifies the original multi-class problem into a two-class regression task.

The dataset contains numerous attributes, each potentially representing different characteristics or measurements relevant to the classification task. The specific nature of these attributes is not provided, but they likely encompass a range of factors that contribute to the classification outcome.

The binary class feature serves as the target variable for predictive modeling, allowing for the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms focused on binary classification tasks.

This dataset may be particularly useful for researchers and data scientists interested in exploring binary classification problems, comparing algorithm performance, or investigating the effects of data transformation on model outcomes.
