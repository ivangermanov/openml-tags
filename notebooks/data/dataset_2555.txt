The Yeast dataset is a multi-label dataset consisting of micro-array expression data as well as phylogenetic profiles of yeast. This comprehensive dataset encompasses a wide range of genetic information, featuring a vast number of genes and predictors. In total, fourteen different labels can be assigned to a gene, although due to label sparsity, only thirteen labels were utilized.

The dataset boasts an impressive array of features, including various attributes that provide valuable insights into the genetic makeup of yeast. Although some of these features may appear technical and complex, they collectively contribute to a richer understanding of this fascinating organism.

The Yeast dataset is an invaluable resource for researchers and scientists seeking to explore the intricacies of genetics and genomics. Its unique combination of micro-array expression data and phylogenetic profiles makes it an ideal platform for investigating the complex relationships between genes and their functions.
