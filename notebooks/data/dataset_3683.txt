QSAR-TID-18033 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase YES, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase YES. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset.

The Tyrosine-Protein Kinase YES is a single protein, also known as Proto-oncogene c-Yes, p61-Yes, and YES1. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TK protein kinase group, and tyrosine protein kinase Src family.

The dataset contains information about the protein target, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also contains information about the compounds, including their mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval.

The protein target is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, regulation of glucose transmembrane transport, and cellular response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulus.
