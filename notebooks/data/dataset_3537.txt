QSAR-TID-10649 Dataset

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10649. It has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.
