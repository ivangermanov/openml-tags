This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Death Associated Protein Kinase Three. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Death Associated Protein Kinase Three.

Death Associated Protein Kinase Three is a single protein preferred name, also known as DAP Kinase Three, DAP-Like Kinase, and Death Associated Protein Kinase Three. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase groups.

The description of Death Associated Protein Kinase Three includes its relationship with other proteins, its function, and the processes it is involved in. It is involved in nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, and many other functions.
