The Meta-Album Plant Document Dataset (Micro) is a collection of images of leaves from healthy and unhealthy plants. These images were downloaded from Google Images and Ecosia, and later cropped by the creators, ensuring that one complete leaf fits in one image. The original, uncropped images vary in scale, light conditions, and pose. However, within one category, images of leaves that came from the same original image can be found. The images correspond to twenty-seven classes, including plant disease names and plant species names.

The dataset was created for benchmarking classification models and was published in a research paper. The Plant Document dataset in the Meta-Album benchmark is extracted from a preprocessed version of the original Plant Document dataset. To obtain independent and identically distributed samples, only one leaf image per each original image is randomly picked. Then, leaves images are cropped and made into squared images, which are then resized into 128x128 pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
