Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset includes multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers, representing various measurements or attributes. The final feature is binaryClass, which indicates the classification outcome.

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem. The transformation process involved calculating the mean value of the original numeric target and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value falls below or above this mean threshold. This binarization approach allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset's purpose appears to be related to mythbusting and various studies, as indicated by the tags. It likely contains experimental or observational data that has been processed to facilitate binary classification tasks. The original source and date of creation are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper citation and acknowledgment of the dataset's provenance.
