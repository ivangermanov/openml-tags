Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled with alphanumeric codes. These features likely represent various marketing-related attributes or variables used in the study.

The Analcatdata Marketing dataset is a modified version of an original marketing-related dataset. It has been transformed to simplify the classification task by converting a multi-class problem into a binary classification problem. This conversion was achieved by grouping the majority class into a positive category and combining all other classes into a negative category.

The dataset is intended for use in marketing studies and analysis, potentially focusing on customer behavior, market segmentation, or product preferences. The binary classification approach may be useful for predictive modeling or hypothesis testing in marketing contexts.

Researchers and data scientists working with this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The original source and date of the dataset are unknown, which may limit some aspects of its contextual interpretation.
