QSAR-TID-12955 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12955. The dataset has 532 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Calpain 1 protein, which is a calcium-activated neutral proteinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. Calpain 1 is involved in proteolysis, cell proliferation, and autophagy, and is also implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening to identify potential inhibitors of Calpain 1. The data can also be used to study the structure-activity relationships of compounds and to identify the key molecular features that determine their activity.
