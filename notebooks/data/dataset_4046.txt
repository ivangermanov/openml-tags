The QSAR-TID-12955 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12955. This dataset has five hundred thirty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs) molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The dataset shows activity values in units of pseudo-pCI50 of several compounds on drug target Calpain One, also known as Calcium-activated Neutral Proteinase One, Calpain-One Catalytic Subunit, Calpain-One Large Subunit, and Canp One.

Calpain One is an enzyme that belongs to the Cysteine Protease Ca Clan and Cysteine Protease C Two Family. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, regulation of macroautophagy, and receptor catabolic process.

This protein is expressed in various cellular components, including the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, lysosome, plasma membrane, and focal adhesion. It has various molecular functions, including calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, protein binding, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.
