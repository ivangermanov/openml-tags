Sub-sampling of the dataset Bank Marketing with seed equal to two, arguments number rows max equals two thousand, arguments number cols max equals one hundred, arguments number classes max equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function sub-sample takes five parameters: self, seed, number rows max, number cols max, number classes max, and stratified. It returns a dataset.

First, it initializes a random number generator using the given seed. Then, it selects the features and target variable from the dataset.

If the number of unique classes in the target variable exceeds the maximum allowed number of classes, it uniformly samples the classes based on their frequency. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, if the number of columns in the feature matrix exceeds the maximum allowed number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns and filters the feature matrix accordingly.

Finally, if the number of rows in the filtered dataset exceeds the maximum allowed number of rows, it performs stratified sampling on the dataset to ensure class balance.

The resulting sub-sampled dataset is then returned along with its metadata.
