Wine Quality

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. The original dataset was created in 2009 and is related to the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, with two variants: red and white wine samples.

The inputs include objective tests, such as pH values, and the output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between zero (very bad) and ten (very excellent).

Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed, including mean absolute deviation and confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance.

The relative importances of the input variables were also measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks, with ordered and unbalanced classes. Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines.

It is also possible that not all input variables are relevant, making it interesting to test feature selection methods. The datasets have eleven input variables, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.

The output variable is the quality of the wine, which is a score between zero and ten. There are no missing attribute values in the dataset.
