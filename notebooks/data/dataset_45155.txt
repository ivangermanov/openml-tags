Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network consists of thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, and the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a model for the management of mildew in winter wheat. It is a complex system that takes into account various factors, including microclimate, leaf area index, and temperature.

The network features a range of variables, including microclimate, leaf area index, and temperature, among others.
