This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes several features that provide valuable information for analysis. These features include Treatment, Cell Type, Status, Karnofsky Performance Status, Months, Age, and Therapy. Each of these features plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset.
