This dataset contains results from the Statlog project, which conducted a comparative study of statistical, neural, and symbolic learning algorithms for classification. The Statlog project (Esprit Project) evaluated approximately twenty different algorithms on over twenty diverse datasets. These evaluations produced numerous interesting findings that are comprehensively described in a published book.

The project aimed to provide advice on which classification methods are most appropriate for particular datasets. This work has been utilized in various publications and conferences focused on machine learning, neural networks, and statistical learning.

The dataset includes information on multiple classification algorithms applied to various datasets. Some of the algorithms featured are C four point five, NewId, CART, Cal five, CN two, Discriminant Analysis, k Nearest Neighbors, Bayesian Trees, and Neural Networks like Backpropagation and Kohonen networks. The datasets used cover a wide range of domains including credit scoring, medical diagnostics, image recognition, and technical fault detection.

The meta dataset consists of five hundred twenty eight instances with twenty two attributes plus a class attribute. Most attributes are continuously valued, with only two being categorical. The attributes capture various characteristics of the datasets and algorithm performance, such as number of examples, number of attributes, number of classes, entropy measures, and normalized error rates.

Some attributes like the second canonical correlation and second eigenvalue only apply to datasets with more than two classes. Missing values are present in the dataset, indicated by question marks for these attributes when they don't apply.

The dataset provides valuable insights into the comparative performance of different machine learning and statistical classification algorithms across a diverse range of problem domains. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating and selecting appropriate classification methods for specific types of datasets.
