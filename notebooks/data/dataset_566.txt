Past Usage: Meta-Data was used to give advice about which classification method is appropriate for a particular dataset. This work is described in various publications, including "Machine Learning, Neural and Statistical Learning" and "Characterizing the Applicability of Classification Algorithms Using Meta-Level Learning".

Relevant Information: This dataset is about the results of the Statlog project, which performed a comparative study between statistical, neural, and symbolic learning algorithms. The project evaluated twenty different algorithms on over twenty different datasets, producing many interesting results. These results are comprehensively described in a book.

Number of Instances: 
Number of Attributes: twenty-two (including an ID number) plus the class attribute – all but two attributes are continuously valued

Attribute Information:

    • Data Set Name: categorical – name of data set
    • Test Examples: continuous – number of examples in test set
    • Total Examples: continuous – total number of examples
    • Attributes: continuous – number of attributes
    • Classes: continuous – number of classes
    • Binary Attributes: continuous – number of binary attributes
    • Cost: continuous – cost (one equals yes, zero equals no)
    • Standard Deviation Ratio: continuous – standard deviation ratio
    • Correlation: continuous – mean correlation between attributes
    • First Canonical Correlation: continuous – first canonical correlation
    • Second Canonical Correlation: continuous – second canonical correlation
    • First Eigenvalue: continuous – first eigenvalue
    • Second Eigenvalue: continuous – second eigenvalue
    • Skewness: continuous – mean of absolute value of expectation of X minus mean cubed divided by standard deviation cubed
    • Kurtosis: continuous – mean of absolute value of expectation of X minus mean to the fourth power divided by standard deviation to the fourth power
    • Mean Entropy of Attributes: continuous – mean entropy of attributes
    • Entropy of Classes: continuous – entropy of classes
    • Mean Mutual Entropy of Class and Attributes: continuous – mean mutual entropy of class and attributes
    • Equivalent Number of Attributes: continuous – equivalent number of attributes
    • Noise-Signal Ratio: continuous – noise-signal ratio
    • Algorithm Name: categorical – name of algorithm
    • Normalized Error: continuous – normalized error (continuous class)

Missing Attribute Values: Note that fract2 and cancor2 only apply to data sets with more than two classes. When they appear as unknown values, this means do not care values.
