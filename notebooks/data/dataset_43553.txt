Cloud Dataset

Tags: Data from StatLib

These data are those collected in a cloud seeding experiment in Tasmania between mid nineteen sixty four and January nineteen seventy one. Their analysis, using regression techniques and permutation tests, is discussed in a publication that examines the results of a cloud seeding experiment in Tasmania. The rainfalls are period rainfalls in inches. The target areas are divided into east and west regions, while the control areas are divided into north, south, and north-west regions respectively. The seeding status is either seeded or unseeded. The rain in the eastern target region is being treated as the class attribute. The attribute for rain in the western target region has been deleted.
