**Child Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education.

The Child Bayesian Network has twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with a total of two hundred thirty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is three, and the average degree is two point five. The maximum in-degree is two.

This network represents a probabilistic model for diagnosing diseases in children, taking into account various factors such as age, medical history, and symptoms. It is designed to help medical professionals make informed decisions based on uncertain evidence.

The network includes variables related to medical conditions, test results, and symptoms, which are interconnected to represent their probabilistic relationships.
