The goal of this ChaLearn challenge is to expose the research community to real-world datasets of interest to Four Paradigm, providing an opportunity for participants to work on diverse and challenging problems. All datasets are formatted uniformly, although the type of data may differ. The data is provided as preprocessed matrices, allowing participants to focus on classification, while also having the option to use additional feature extraction procedures as long as they do not violate any rules of the challenge.

All problems are binary classification problems and are assessed using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, although its structure is revealed. The final score in the second phase will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets, generating a ranking from which winners will be determined.

Each task is constrained by a time budget, and the Codalab platform provides computational resources shared by all participants. Each code submission will be executed in a compute worker with specific characteristics, ensuring fair evaluation. When a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited to ensure fairness.

The ChaLearn challenge includes the Ada dataset, which is tagged as related to demographics and health. This dataset features a set of variables, including class and forty-three other variables, although their specific meanings are not disclosed.
