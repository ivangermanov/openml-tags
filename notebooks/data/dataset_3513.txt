QSAR-TID-101222 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101222. The dataset has seventy-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101222. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Casein Kinase I Isoform Alpha-Like protein, which is a single protein target.

The Casein Kinase I Isoform Alpha-Like protein is a member of the CK1 protein kinase group and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and Wnt signaling pathway. It is also known to play a role in the negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Casein Kinase I Isoform Alpha-Like protein.
