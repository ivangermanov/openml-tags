QSAR-TID-101222 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101222, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The features include molecule ChEMBL ID and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The data shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101222.

The dataset was created using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The features were obtained from SMILES strings.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101222.
