QSAR-TID-10906 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK is a single protein preferred name, also known as p72-Syk, Spleen Tyrosine Kinase SYK, and Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group/tyrosine protein kinase Syk family.

The dataset contains information on the mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval of various compounds, including R-406, LANRAPLENIB, R-343, MIVAVOTINIB, and SOVLEPLENIB, which are all tyrosine-protein kinase SYK inhibitors.

The dataset also includes information on the expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process of Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK, which is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, cell activation, immune response, and protein phosphorylation.
