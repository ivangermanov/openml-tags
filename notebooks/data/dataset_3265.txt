This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK.

The dataset has one thousand and four rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

Features represent FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK, also known as spleen tyrosine kinase, which is a single protein enzyme kinase protein kinase group tyrosine protein kinase Syk family.

It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, adaptive immune response, and positive regulation of cytokine production.

In addition, it is involved in stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways, positive regulation of receptor internalization, and regulation of superoxide anion generation.
