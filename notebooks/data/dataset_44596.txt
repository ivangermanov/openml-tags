Name: Blood Transfusion Service Center

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Blood Transfusion Service Center with seed, number of rows, number of columns, number of classes, and stratify arguments.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the classes, columns, and rows. The function first selects the classes, then the columns, and finally the rows. It uses stratified sampling to ensure that the classes are represented proportionally in the new dataset.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for random sampling, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratified sampling. It returns a new dataset with the specified characteristics.

The dataset is subsampled by first selecting the classes, then the columns, and finally the rows. The classes are selected using random sampling, with the probability of each class being selected proportional to its frequency in the original dataset. The columns are then selected randomly, and the rows are selected using stratified sampling to ensure that the classes are represented proportionally.

The resulting dataset has the specified number of rows, columns, and classes, and is suitable for use in machine learning algorithms.
