QSAR-TID-11441 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase Beta, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase Beta. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase Beta is a single protein preferred name, also known as Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Beta, PTPB, PTPRB, and R-PTP-beta. It is an enzyme, phosphatase, protein phosphatase, tyrosine protein phosphatase, and receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase. It is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, phosphatase, protein phosphatase, tyrosine protein phosphatase, and receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR data and models.
