This dataset, named QSAR-TID-30004, is tagged as Government, MTLQSAR, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30004. There are eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset provides information about the Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase sixteen, also known as hPSK, MPSK, MPSK one, Myristoylated and Palmitoylated Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase, PKL twelve. This enzyme is found in Homo sapiens species group. 

It is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, other protein kinase group, and other protein kinase NAK family. 

The dataset describes the expression atlas, component, function, process, and interactions of this enzyme. 

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase, enzyme, protein kinase.
