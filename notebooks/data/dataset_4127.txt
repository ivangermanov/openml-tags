QSAR-TID-30004 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30004. The dataset has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30004. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and other machine learning applications.

The target protein is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Sixteen, which is a single protein target. It is also known as hPSK, MPSK, MPSK1, Myristoylated and Palmitoylated Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase, and PKL Twelve. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein autophosphorylation, and cellular response to transforming growth factor beta stimulus.
