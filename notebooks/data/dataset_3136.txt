QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC values. Features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target protein is Vitamin K dependent protein C, also known as Anticoagulant protein C, Blood coagulation factor XIV, and Autoprothrombin IIA. It is classified as a serine protease enzyme in the S subfamily of the PA clan. The protein is found in humans and is involved in blood coagulation, hemostasis, and regulation of inflammatory responses. It functions in the extracellular region, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus.

Key molecular functions include endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, and protein binding. The protein participates in proteolysis, blood coagulation, and negative regulation of coagulation and apoptotic processes. It is associated with hereditary thrombophilia due to protein C deficiency.

The protein interacts with various pathways including the intrinsic and common pathways of fibrin clot formation, gamma carboxylation of protein precursors, and regulation of insulin like growth factor transport. It contains domains such as EGF type, GLA, trypsin, and peptidase S domains.

Structural information is available in the Protein Data Bank with multiple entries. The protein is also referenced in databases such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PharmGKB.
