**Data Description**

The dataset has been generated from a sophisticated simulator of a Gas Turbine, mounted on a Frigate characterized by a Combined Diesel Electric And Gas propulsion plant type. The propulsion system behavior has been described with three parameters: ship speed, which is a linear function of the lever position; compressor degradation coefficient; and turbine degradation coefficient. Each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of these three parameters. A series of measures, which indirectly represent the state of the system subject to performance decay, has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space. The goal is to estimate the gas turbine compressor decay state coefficient from the given measurements.

**Dataset Information**

The experiments have been carried out by means of a numerical simulator of a naval vessel, characterized by a Gas Turbine propulsion plant. The different blocks forming the complete simulator, including the propeller, hull, gas turbine, gear box, and controller, have been developed and fine-tuned over the years on several similar real propulsion plants. The available data are in agreement with a possible real vessel. The propulsion system behavior has been described with three parameters: ship speed, compressor degradation coefficient, and turbine degradation coefficient. Each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of these three parameters. The range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with a uniform grid of high precision, so as to have a good granularity of representation. In particular, the compressor decay state has been investigated in the domain of high to low degradation, and the turbine coefficient in the domain of high to moderate degradation. Ship speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speeds from low to high speeds with a granularity of representation equal to three knots. A series of measures, which indirectly represent the state of the system subject to performance decay, has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space.
