This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-10542, falls under the categories of Computer Systems, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR. It is part of the MetaQSAR project, released in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, which displays activity values of various compounds on drug target TID 10542. There are 351 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Since generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, all bits are generated.

Some of the features include molecule ID, fixed count fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four zero, fixed count fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four one, and so on.

Keywords: QSAR, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Computer Systems, MetaQSAR, Drug Target, Molecular Fingerprints.
