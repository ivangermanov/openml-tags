The QSAR-TID-30016 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30016. This dataset has ninety-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four features, and median pXC50.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand sixteen.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BMX is a single protein preferred name, also known as bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X protein, cytoplasmic tyrosine-protein kinase BMX, epithelial and endothelial tyrosine kinase ETK. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase Tec family classification.

This protein is found in Homo sapiens species group and has relationships with other proteins. It is involved in various biological processes, including adaptive immune response, protein phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic process, apoptotic process, cell adhesion, signal transduction, mesoderm development, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, protein autophosphorylation, and B cell receptor signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, tyrosine-protein kinase, BMX, MetaQSAR, ChEMBL, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction.
