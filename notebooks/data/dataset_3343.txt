QSAR-TID-14037 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14037. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.

The dataset contains information about the Dopamine D2 receptor, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is a G protein-coupled receptor and a small molecule receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, response to hypoxia, and neuron migration.

The receptor is also involved in various signaling pathways, including G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and dopamine receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset provides information about the receptor's function, including its role in neurotransmitter receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and dopamine binding. It also provides information about the receptor's involvement in various biological processes, including response to amphetamine, regulation of heart rate, and regulation of sodium ion transport.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying the Dopamine D2 receptor and its role in various biological processes.
