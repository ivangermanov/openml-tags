The Dow Jones Index Data Set

In our research, each record represents data for a week, and each record includes the percentage of return that stock has in the following week, which is denoted as percent change next weeks price. Ideally, you want to determine which stock will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week, and this can help you train and test your algorithm.

Some of these attributes might not be used in your research. They were originally added to our database to perform calculations. The attributes that were used in previous research include percent change price, percent change volume over last week, days to next dividend, and percent return next dividend. We left the other attributes in the dataset in case you wanted to use any of them. Of course, what you want to maximize is percent change next weeks price.

When it comes to training data versus test data, we used quarter one data for training and quarter two data for testing. An interesting data point to note is that if you use quarter two data for testing, you will notice that in the week ending May twenty-seventh, two thousand eleven, every Dow Jones Index stock lost money.
