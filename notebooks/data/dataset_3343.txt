QSAR-TID-14037 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14037.

The dataset has several features representing FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

Description
The Dopamine D2 Receptor is a single protein and is also known as D(2) Dopamine Receptor, Dopamine D2 Receptor, and Drd2. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, monoamine receptor, and dopamine receptor.

This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, response to hypoxia, neuron migration, negative regulation of protein phosphorylation, startle response, response to amphetamine, nervous system process involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, and regulation of heart rate.

It is also involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, negative regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting dopamine receptor signaling pathway, and dopamine receptor signaling pathway.

Additionally, this receptor plays a role in neuron-neuron synaptic transmission, neuroblast proliferation, axonogenesis, synapse assembly, sensory perception of smell, behavior, long-term memory, grooming behavior, locomotory behavior, adult walking behavior, feeding behavior, and protein localization.
