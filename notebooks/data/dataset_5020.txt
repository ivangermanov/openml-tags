**Link Bayesian Network**

The Link Bayesian Network is a repository of discrete very large Bayesian networks, which is a type of machine learning model used in agriculture. This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, with an average Markov blanket size and average degree.

The network has been used in various applications, including linkage analysis in large pedigrees with many loops. The blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm was developed specifically for this purpose.

Features of the network include various variables related to agriculture, such as crop yields, soil types, and weather conditions. These variables are interconnected, allowing for complex relationships to be modeled and analyzed.
