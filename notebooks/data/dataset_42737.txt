Achieved Frames per Second in Video Games

This dataset contains frames per second measurement of video games executed on computers. Each row of the dataset describes the outcome of frames per second measurement for a video game executed on a computer. A computer is characterized by its central processing unit and graphics processing unit. For both, the name is resolved to technical specifications.

The technical specification of central processing unit and graphics processing unit are technical specifications that describe the factory state of the respective component. The game is characterized by its name, the displayed resolution, and the quality setting that was adjusted during the measurement.

Source of Data

The measurements are gathered from the websites User Benchmark and FPS Benchmark. The source of each measurement is indicated by the attribute dataset, which takes the value User Benchmark or FPS Benchmark. For User Benchmark, the frames per second values are extracted from the published histograms. Hence, the frames per second values are binned to bins with a certain width starting at a certain value, and there are multiple measurements for the same computer and software configuration.
