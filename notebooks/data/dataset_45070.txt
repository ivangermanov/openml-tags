One of the biggest challenges of an auto dealership purchasing a used car at an auto auction is the risk of buying a vehicle that might have serious issues preventing it from being sold to customers. The auto community refers to these unfortunate purchases as "kick" cars. Kicked cars often result when there are tampered odometers, mechanical issues the dealer is not able to address, issues with obtaining the vehicle title from the seller, or some other unforeseen problem. These kick cars can be very costly to dealers after factoring in transportation costs, unnecessary repair work, and market losses incurred while attempting to resell the vehicle.

Modelers who can accurately identify which cars have a higher risk of being kicked can provide significant value to dealerships striving to offer the best possible inventory selection to their customers. The challenge of this competition is to predict whether the car purchased at the auction is a kick, thereby helping dealerships avoid costly mistakes.
