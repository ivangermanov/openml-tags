This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers forty-nine states of the United States of America. The accident data were collected from February to December over a period of five years, using two application programming interfaces that provide streaming traffic incident or event data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks.

The dataset currently contains approximately four point two million accident records. It is a valuable resource for researchers, academics, and professionals working in the fields of computer systems and machine learning.

If you use this dataset, please acknowledge the authors by citing their papers. The dataset was collected in real-time, using multiple traffic APIs. It contains accident data that were collected for the contiguous United States.

The US Accidents dataset can be used for numerous applications such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accidents hotspot locations, casualty analysis, and extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. The most recent release of the dataset can also be useful to study the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.
