QSAR-TID-11427 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11427. The dataset has 167 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dopamine D2 receptor, also known as D(2) dopamine receptor, Dopamine D2 receptor Drd2. The Dopamine D2 receptor is a single protein, and it is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, a Small molecule receptor, and a Monoamine receptor.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.

The Dopamine D2 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, response to hypoxia, neuron migration, negative regulation of protein phosphorylation, and startle response. It is also involved in the regulation of heart rate, sodium ion transport, and G protein-coupled receptor internalization.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the Golgi membrane, acrosomal vesicle, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, cilium, and synaptic vesicle membrane. It is also involved in various cellular components, including the postsynaptic membrane, presynaptic membrane, and dendritic spine.
