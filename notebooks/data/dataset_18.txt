The Multiple Features Dataset: Morphological is one of a set of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Each dataset corresponds to the same original character. Two thousand instances have been digitized in binary images, with two hundred instances per class.

This particular dataset represents these digits in terms of six morphological features, although the meaning of these features is mostly unknown. They are not explicitly named in the original files, and the relevant papers only discuss 'orphological features, such as the number of endpoints'.

A slightly different version of the database was used in a study on handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers. The current database has been utilized in a review of statistical pattern recognition.

The dataset consists of features of handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Two thousand patterns have been digitized in binary images, with two hundred patterns per class. These digits are represented in terms of six feature sets, including morphological features.

In each file, the two thousand patterns are stored in ASCII on two thousand lines. The first two hundred patterns are of class zero, followed by sets of two hundred patterns for each of the classes one through nine. Corresponding patterns in different feature sets correspond to the same original character. Unfortunately, the source image dataset is lost. However, using the pixel dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained.

There are no missing values in this dataset. Additionally, there are six files in total, each representing a different feature set.
