Multiple Features Dataset: Morphological is one of a set of datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (zero to nine) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. A substantial number of instances per class have been digitized in binary images, resulting in a total of thousands of instances. In this particular dataset, these digits are represented in terms of six morphological features.

Attribute Information:
The meaning of the features is largely unknown. They are not named in the original files, and the associated paper only mentions "morphological features, such as the number of endpoints" without providing further details.

Relevant Papers:
A slightly different version of the database is used in a paper discussing handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers, published in Kybernetika. The database in its current form is utilized in a review paper on statistical pattern recognition, published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

Dataset Information:
This dataset comprises features of handwritten numerals (zero to nine) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. A significant number of patterns per class have been digitized in binary images, resulting in thousands of patterns in total. These digits are represented in terms of several feature sets, including Fourier coefficients of the character shapes, profile correlations, Karhunen-Love coefficients, pixel averages in windows, Zernike moments, and morphological features.

In each file, the patterns are stored in ASCII format, with each line representing a single pattern. The patterns are grouped by class, with the first set belonging to class 'zero', followed by sets for each of the classes 'one' through 'nine'. Corresponding patterns in different feature sets correspond to the same original character.

It is worth noting that the source image dataset has been lost. However, using the pixel dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained at a resolution of fifteen by sixteen pixels.

This dataset does not contain any missing values.
