QSAR-TID-20166 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Histamine H3 Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Histamine H3 Receptor. The Histamine H3 Receptor is a single protein, also known as H3R, HH3R, and HRH3, and is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is a small molecule receptor. It is a monoamine receptor, and is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Histamine H3 Receptor is a protein target, classified as a membrane receptor, and is involved in multiple biological processes, including the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
