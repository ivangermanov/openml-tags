This classic dataset originally contained the prices and other attributes of almost fifty-four thousand diamonds. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that fourteen thousand one hundred eighty-four of these diamonds seem to be duplicates, measured from a different angle. This duplication can be discovered by checking for duplicate values while disregarding the variables of length, width, depth, and table, which are dependent on the angle.

Attribute Information:

The price attribute represents the content price of each diamond in United States dollars, ranging from three hundred twenty-six dollars to eighteen thousand eight hundred twenty-three dollars, and serves as the target feature.

The carat attribute represents the weight of each diamond, ranging from point two to five point zero one.

The cut attribute represents the quality of the cut of each diamond, categorized into five distinct levels: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal.

The color attribute represents the diamond color, graded on a scale from J, being the worst, to D, being the best.

The clarity attribute represents a measurement of how clear each diamond is, categorized into eight distinct levels: I1, being the worst, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, and IF, being the best.

The length, width, and depth attributes represent the dimensions of each diamond in millimeters.

The depth attribute represents the total depth percentage of each diamond, calculated as the ratio of the depth to the mean of the length and width.

The table attribute represents the width of the top of each diamond relative to its widest point.
