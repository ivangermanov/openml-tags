**Diamonds**
**Tags:** 

This classic dataset originally contained the prices and other attributes of almost fifty-four thousand diamonds. However, a significant portion of those seem to be the same diamonds, measured from a different angle. This can be discovered by checking for duplicated values when disregarding the variables length, width, depth, and table, which are dependent on the angle.

**Attribute Information**

The price of the diamond, which is the target feature, is measured in US dollars and ranges from three hundred twenty-six dollars to eighteen thousand eight hundred twenty-three dollars.

The carat of the diamond refers to its weight, which ranges from point two to five point zero one.

The cut of the diamond refers to its quality, which can be classified as Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, or Ideal.

The color of the diamond is measured on a scale from J, which is the worst, to D, which is the best.

The clarity of the diamond is a measurement of how clear it is, with classifications ranging from I1, which is the worst, to IF, which is the best.

The length, width, and depth of the diamond are measured in millimeters.

The depth percentage of the diamond is calculated as the total depth percentage, which is the depth divided by the mean of the length and width.

The table of the diamond refers to the width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.
