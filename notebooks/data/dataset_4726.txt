Subsampling of the dataset Riccardo with the following parameters: 

The function takes several parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether or not to use stratification. 

First, it uniformly samples the classes. If there are more than the specified maximum number of classes, it selects the desired number using a probability proportional to their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, it uniformly samples the columns if required. If there are more columns than the specified maximum, it randomly chooses the desired number.

Finally, it samples the rows accordingly. If there are more rows than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling based on the target variable.

The resulting dataset contains only the selected columns and rows, and the categorical mask is adjusted accordingly.
