This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes several features that describe the characteristics of the delta ailerons, including roll rate, pitch rate, current pitch, current roll, and difference in roll rate. These features have been carefully selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the delta ailerons.
