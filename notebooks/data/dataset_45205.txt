Win95pts Bayesian Network. Sample 8.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this dataset, which is characterized by a large number of nodes and arcs. This complex network consists of seventy-six nodes and one hundred twelve arcs, resulting in five hundred seventy-four parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately six, while the average degree is nearly three. Furthermore, the maximum in-degree reaches seven.
