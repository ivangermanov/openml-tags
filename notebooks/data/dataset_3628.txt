QSAR-TID-12294 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12294. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12294. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the Melanocortin receptor five, which is a single protein and a preferred name. It is also known as Mc five R and has synonyms such as Melanocortin receptor five. The organism is Mus musculus, and the species group is No. The protein target classification is one, which is a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the Melanocortin receptor five, including its expression in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and membrane. It also provides information on its function, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, melanocortin receptor activity, and hormone binding. Additionally, the dataset provides information on the biological process of the Melanocortin receptor five, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of metabolic process.
