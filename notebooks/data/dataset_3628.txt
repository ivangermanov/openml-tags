MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple fingerprint features.
