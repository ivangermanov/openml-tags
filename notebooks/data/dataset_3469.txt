The QSAR-TID-102770 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 102770. This dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide high-quality QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset contains information about the molecules, including their chemical structures and activity values, which can be used to develop predictive models for drug discovery.

The drug target TID: 102770 is a single protein known as Serine/threonine-protein kinase SIK three, which belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group, specifically the CAMK one family and the CAMK protein kinase QIK subfamily. It is involved in various cellular processes, including microtubule cytoskeleton organization, protein phosphorylation, and intracellular signal transduction.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, predictive modeling, drug discovery, Serine/threonine-protein kinase SIK three, CAMK protein kinase group.
