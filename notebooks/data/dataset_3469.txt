QSAR-TID-102770 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102770. The dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102770. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 102770, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase SIK three is a single protein that is also known as KIAA nine nine nine, QSK, Salt-inducible kinase three, and Serine/threonine-protein kinase QSK. It is a protein kinase that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group, CAMK one family, and CAMK protein kinase QIK subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including microtubule cytoskeleton organization, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, positive regulation of TORC one signaling, and positive regulation of TORC two signaling. It is also involved in the binding of nucleotides, magnesium ions, and ATP, and has protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and tau-protein kinase activity.
