Diabetes Dataset 2019
Tags: Context

This dataset was collected for research and non-commercial purposes only. The dataset is accompanied by an article that implements its use.

The dataset contains a total of instances with seventeen independent predictor variables and one binary target or dependent variable, which indicates whether an individual has diabetes or not.

We would like to extend our gratitude to all the participants who contributed towards the building of this dataset.

The primary inspiration behind creating this dataset is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of predicting whether a person has diabetes or not.

The features included in this dataset are age, gender, family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, physical activity level, body mass index, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, sleep patterns, quality of sound sleep, regularity of medication intake, junk food consumption, stress levels, blood pressure levels, number of pregnancies, presence of polydipsia, frequency of urination, and diabetic status.
