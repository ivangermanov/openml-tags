QSAR-TID-101078 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated protein kinase six, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated protein kinase six. The dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. The dataset should be cited as MetaQSAR project - September two thousand fifteen.

The target protein is Mitogen-activated protein kinase six, which is a single protein and has the preferred name Mitogen-activated protein kinase six. It also has synonyms such as ERK three, ERK-three, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase three, MAPK six, and MAPK six - All. The target protein is from the species Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CMGC protein kinase group, CMGC protein kinase MAPK family, and CMGC protein kinase ERK three.

The target protein has several functions including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein kinase binding, and protein heterodimerization activity. It is also involved in several processes including MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, signal transduction, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, and positive regulation of dendritic spine development.
