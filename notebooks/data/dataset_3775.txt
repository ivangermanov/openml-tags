QSAR-TID-88 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID eighty-eight.

The dataset has eight hundred ninety-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fingerprint six one zero two four zero, fingerprint six one zero two four one, and so on.
