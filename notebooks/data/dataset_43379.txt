In the world of Pokémon academia, one dataset stands out - Pokémon-Legendary-Data. This dataset is dedicated to understanding the relationship between Pokémon and their human trainers, with a focus on the unique characteristics of legendary Pokémon.

For this research project, we will be investigating the defining features of legendary Pokémon to improve our understanding of their temperament. Our journey begins at a research lab, where we will be using the Pokédex, an encyclopedic guide to Pokémon, to explore the variables that could explain what makes a Pokémon legendary.

The Pokédex contains a wealth of information, including numerical fighter stats such as attack, defense, and speed, as well as categorizations of Pokémon type, such as bug, dark, and dragon. The binary classification variable we will be predicting is whether a Pokémon is legendary or not.

Before we delve deeper into these variables, let's first find out how many Pokémon are legendary out of the total. This will give us a better understanding of the scope of our research.
