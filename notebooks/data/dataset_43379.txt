In the world of Pokémon academia, a particular area of study has garnered significant attention - the relationship between Pokémon and their human trainers. To delve deeper into this complex bond, a research project has been undertaken to investigate the defining characteristics of Legendary Pokémon, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of their temperament.

The research commences at the laboratory in Pallet Town, Kanto, where the Pokémon encyclopedia, known as the Pokédex, serves as the primary source of data. This comprehensive guide contains information on numerous variables that could potentially explain what makes a Pokémon Legendary. These variables include various numerical fighter statistics, such as Attack, Defense, Speed, and so on, as well as a categorization of Pokémon Type (Bug, Dark, Dragon, etc.).

The binary classification variable, Is Legendary, is tagged 'one' if a Pokémon is indeed Legendary and 'zero' if it is not. Before exploring these variables further, it is essential to determine the number of Legendary Pokémon among the total, utilizing the count function from the Dplyr package.
