The QSAR-TID-10074 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10074. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015. It is essential to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target is a single protein, specifically an enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily.

The dataset also includes Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, which provide information about the biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions associated with the target. These annotations include terms related to proteolysis, peptide metabolism, and protein processing.

Additionally, the dataset provides links to other databases, such as canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, and UniProt, which offer further information about the target and its biological context.
