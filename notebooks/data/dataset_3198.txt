QSAR-TID-10074 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10074. The dataset has rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10074. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The dataset is composed of several compounds, each with its corresponding activity value on drug target TID: 10074. The activity values are represented as pseudo-pCI50, which is a measure of the compound's potency. The dataset also includes features that represent the molecular structure of each compound, which were generated using the FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints method.

The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints method is a widely used technique for generating molecular fingerprints, which are used to represent the molecular structure of a compound. The method generates a binary vector of length 1024, where each bit corresponds to a specific molecular feature. The resulting fingerprints can be used to compare the molecular structure of different compounds and to predict their activity on a given drug target.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a collaborative effort between several research groups and institutions, with the goal of providing a valuable resource for the scientific community.
