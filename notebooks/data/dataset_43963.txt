**Data Description**
The Cross-Section Data originates from the March Current Population Survey by the US Census Bureau. The data is a sample of men aged eighteen to seventy with positive annual income greater than fifty dollars, who are not self-employed nor working without pay. Wages are deflated by the deflator of Personal Consumption Expenditure. A problem with Current Population Survey data is that it does not provide actual work experience. It is therefore customary to compute experience as age minus education minus six, as was done by previous researchers, this may be considered potential experience. As a result, some respondents have negative experience.
