The Round Blue Cell Tumors (SRBCT) dataset is a machine learning dataset related to microarray analysis. This dataset is particularly useful for classification and diagnostic prediction of cancers using gene expression profiling and artificial neural networks.

The SRBCT dataset contains a large number of features, including genes that are relevant to cancer diagnosis and treatment. These features are essential for developing machine learning models that can accurately predict cancer types and outcomes.

The dataset has been widely used in research studies focused on improving cancer diagnosis and treatment. One notable study published in Nature Medicine demonstrated the effectiveness of using gene expression profiling and artificial neural networks for classifying and diagnosing cancers.
