This dataset provides information about Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CSK, also known as CSK or C-Src Kinase, which is a single protein belonging to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group/tyrosine protein kinase Csk family.

It is involved in various biological processes, including adaptive immune response, immune system process, protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, and many others.

Additionally, it participates in several cellular components, such as cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, cell-cell junction, and extracellular exosome.
