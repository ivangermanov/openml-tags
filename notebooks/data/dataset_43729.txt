Context: I wanted a highly imbalanced dataset to share with others, and this one fits the bill perfectly. Imbalanced data typically refers to a classification problem where the number of observations per class is not equally distributed; often, you'll have a large amount of data or observations for one class, referred to as the majority class, and much fewer observations for one or more other classes, referred to as the minority classes. For example, in this dataset, there are way more samples of fully paid borrowers versus not fully paid borrowers.

The Lending Club Loan Data is a highly imbalanced dataset that contains historical data from a specific time period. For companies like Lending Club, correctly predicting whether or not a loan will default is crucial. This dataset provides an opportunity to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

The dataset includes features such as credit policy, purpose, interest rate, installment, log annual income, debt-to-income ratio, FICO score, days with a credit line, revolving balance, revolving utilization, inquiries in the last six months, delinquencies in two years, and public records.
