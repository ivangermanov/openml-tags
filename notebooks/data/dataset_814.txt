Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset, known as CHSCase Vine, is a modified version of an original dataset from an unknown source. The modification process involved binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with target values below the mean were classified as positive and denoted with 'P', while those at or above the mean were classified as negative and marked with 'N'. This binarization process simplifies the classification task and allows for binary analysis of the data.

The dataset is associated with various study tags, suggesting its potential use in multiple research contexts. It may be particularly relevant for mythbusting exercises and various types of studies across different domains. The original source and date of creation remain unknown, highlighting the importance of proper citation and acknowledgment of this binarized version when used in research or analysis.

Features included in the dataset are col_1 and col_2, along with the binarized class feature. These column names suggest a simplified or anonymized structure, possibly to protect the privacy of the original data or to focus on the core analytical aspects without revealing specific attribute names.
