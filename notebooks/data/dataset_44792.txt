Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Upselling

Generated with the following source code:

This dataset is a subsample of the original KDD Cup 09 Upselling dataset, which has been reduced in size to facilitate faster processing and analysis. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns from the original dataset, while ensuring that the resulting dataset remains stratified and representative of the original data.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset, with the goal of reducing the number of classes to a maximum of ten. This was achieved by uniformly sampling the classes, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class in the original dataset.

Once the classes were selected, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce the number of features to a maximum of one hundred. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and make it more manageable for analysis.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were stratified and sampled to reduce the total number of samples to a maximum of two thousand. This was done to ensure that the resulting dataset remains representative of the original data, while also reducing the computational resources required for analysis.
