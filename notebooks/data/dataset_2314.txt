Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SRC is a single protein, also known as Proto-Oncogene c-SRC or simply Src. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and is classified under the tyrosine protein kinase src family.

This protein is primarily found in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, lysosome, late endosome, cytosol, and other cellular components. Its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, and non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SRC is involved in various biological processes, including primary ovarian follicle growth, immune system process, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, cell adhesion, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, and many others.
