The QSAR-TID-103433 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103433. This dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes various features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. It also includes information about the target classification, which belongs to the enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, STE protein kinase group, STE protein kinase STE twenty family, and STE protein kinase FRAY subfamily.

The target is a single protein known as Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase OSR One, which is also referred to as OSR One, OSR One GN, Oxidative Stress-Responsive One Protein, and OXSR One. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens.

The dataset provides information about the expression atlas, gene ontology component, gene ontology function, and gene ontology process. It also includes information about the protein target classification, target type, and synonyms.

The scraped data includes information about the ID, type, preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, description, relationship, accession, and expression atlas.
