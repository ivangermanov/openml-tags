Amazon Ratings (Beauty Products)

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Amazon.com is one of the largest electronic commerce and cloud computing companies. The company has experienced significant losses due to technical issues, such as the forty-minute website downtime in August, which resulted in substantial financial losses. Additionally, Amazon holds the patent on One-Click buying and licenses it to other major technology companies like Apple. The company's fulfillment centers, such as the massive Phoenix center, are sprawling facilities that cover an enormous area.

Amazon relies heavily on its recommendation engine, which reviews customer ratings and purchase history to suggest items and improve sales. This system plays a crucial role in enhancing customer experience and driving revenue growth.

This dataset relates to over two million customer reviews and ratings of beauty-related products sold on the Amazon website. It contains unique user identifiers, product identifiers, ratings ranging from one to five based on customer satisfaction, and timestamps of the ratings in Unix time.

Acknowledgments:
A description of the entire Amazon products dataset is available, which contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including reviews, ratings, text, helpfulness votes, product descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features, as well as links to also-viewed and also-bought graphs.

Can a good recommendation engine be created from this minimal dataset? This is an intriguing question that invites exploration and experimentation.
