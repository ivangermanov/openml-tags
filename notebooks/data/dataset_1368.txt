QSAR-TID-101448 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101448. The dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen.
