The Meta-Album PlantNet Dataset is a subset of the Pl@ntNet-300k dataset, which is itself a sampling of the Pl@ntNet Project's repository. This dataset is created by sampling the Pl@ntNet-300k dataset, retaining only the twenty-five most populous classes, belonging to twenty-one genera, for a total of images. Each image contains a colored one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight image of a plant or a part of a plant from the corresponding class.

This dataset is sourced by citizen botanists from around the world, and then confirmed using a weighted reliability score from other users, such that each image has been reviewed by an average of citizen botanists. The images are scaled from their initial variable width using the Inter-Area anti-aliasing filter from OpenCV. Almost all images were initially square; cropping by taking the largest possible square with the center at the middle of the initial image was applied otherwise.
