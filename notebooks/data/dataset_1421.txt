MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-12894 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12894. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and contains data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows the activity values of various compounds on a specific drug target.

Features include molecular identifiers and molecular fingerprints. These molecular fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is related to the metabotropic glutamate receptor one, which is a single protein target. This receptor is also known as GPRC one A, GRM one, metabotropic glutamate receptor one, mGLUR one, and MGluR one.

The metabotropic glutamate receptor one is primarily found in the rat species, specifically Rattus norvegicus. It belongs to the membrane receptor family and is classified under the category of small molecule receptors.

This receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, and chemical synaptic transmission. It is also involved in regulating locomotory behavior, glutamate secretion, and sensory perception of pain.

Keywords: metabotropic glutamate receptor, QSAR data, molecular fingerprints, drug target, biological processes.
