Scraped Data:
Dataset Information
Additional Information
The dataset was acquired and annotated by professional physicians at Hospital Universitario de Caracas.
The subjective judgments (target variables) were originally done in an ordinal manner (poor, fair, good, excellent) and was discretized in two classes (bad, good).
Images were randomly sampled from the original colposcopic sequences (videos).
The original images and the manual segmentations are included in the 'images' directory.
The dataset has three modalities (i.e. Hinselmann, Green, Schiller).
The target variables are expert::X (X in 0,...,5) and consensus.

Has Missing Values? No

Additional Variable Information
Three modalities: Hinselmann, Green, Schiller.
Number of Attributes: 69 (62 predictive attributes, 7 target variables)

Keywords: digital colposcopy, green, cervix, image analysis, color information, shape features, expert assessment, consensus.
