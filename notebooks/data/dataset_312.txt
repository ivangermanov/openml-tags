Scene Recognition Dataset

Tags: multi label, mythbusting, OpenML, study

Description:
This dataset focuses on scene recognition and contains characteristics about images and their classes. Originally designed as a multi label classification problem with six different labels (Beach, Sunset, Fall Foliage, Field, Mountain, Urban), the current version has been simplified to a binary classification problem considering only the 'Urban' label.

Dataset Information:
The Scene Recognition Dataset is a multi label classification problem based on real world images. It comprises instances with numerous numerical features, each ranging in value from zero to one. The classification task involves two classes: Urban and Not Urban. Notably, there are no missing values in this dataset.

The dataset originates from research in pattern recognition and machine learning, specifically in the domain of multi label scene classification. It has been utilized in various studies and is part of the OpenML collection.

Features:
The dataset includes a large number of attributes, each representing different characteristics of the images. These features are numerical in nature and have been normalized to fall within a specific range. While the exact meaning of each attribute is not provided, they likely represent various visual and statistical properties of the images that are relevant for scene classification.

Applications:
This dataset can be valuable for researchers and practitioners working on image classification, scene recognition, and multi label learning problems. It provides a real world example of how complex visual information can be encoded into numerical features for machine learning tasks.

The binary nature of the current version (Urban vs. Not Urban) makes it suitable for studying urban scene detection algorithms, which could have applications in areas such as urban planning, geographic information systems, and automated image tagging.
