QSAR-TID-12131 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12131. It has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature, namely MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset includes information about Renin, also known as Angiotensinogenase, which is an enzyme belonging to the Aspartic protease family. It plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system, a physiological pathway involved in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance. 

Expression Atlas provides information about gene expression across different tissues and organisms. Gene Ontology annotations provide insights into the biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions associated with this protein. 

Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe provide additional information about protein function, structure, and interactions.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, Renin, Angiotensinogenase, Aspartic protease, gene expression, protein function.
