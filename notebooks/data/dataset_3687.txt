QSAR-TID-11281 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11281. The dataset has forty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11281. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in metabotropic glutamate receptor eight.

The metabotropic glutamate receptor eight is a single protein that belongs to the family C G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including cell communication, signal transduction, and synaptic transmission. The receptor is also involved in several diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for the metabotropic glutamate receptor eight. The models can be used to predict the activity of new compounds and to identify potential leads for drug development.
