This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 8, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous other molecular fingerprints.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The target is Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor eight, also known as GPRC one H, GRM eight, mGluR eight, and MGLUR eight, which is a single protein preferred name. It is a member of the family C G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in signal transduction pathways.

It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes including cell communication, signal transduction, and response to stimulus.
