The Diggle Table A One dataset has been modified into a binarized version of the original data set. This alteration involves converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean was calculated, and subsequently, all instances with a lower target value were classified as Positive, denoted by 'P', whereas all others were classified as Negative, denoted by 'N'. 

This dataset falls under the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study, and is particularly relevant for studies one, fifteen, twenty, and forty-one.
