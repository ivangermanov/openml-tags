The DNA dataset is a collection of three thousand one hundred eighty-six data points, each representing a splice junction, which is described by one hundred eighty indicator binary variables. The primary goal is to identify three distinct classes - exon-intron, intron-exon, and neither - that define the boundaries between exons, the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing, and introns, the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out.

This dataset originated from the StatLog project and was later processed to create a version suitable for machine learning applications. The original symbolic variables representing the four nucleotides - adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine - were replaced by three binary indicator variables, resulting in a transformation of sixty symbolic attributes into one hundred eighty binary attributes. Furthermore, the names of the examples were removed, and the examples with ambiguities were eliminated, leaving a clean and refined dataset.

A notable aspect of this dataset is that much better performance can be achieved by utilizing attributes closest to the junction, specifically attributes sixty-one to one hundred twenty. This is because these attributes contain more relevant information about the splice junctions, allowing for more accurate classification.

The dataset has been widely used in various studies, including study ninety-eight, study ninety-nine, and study one hundred thirty-five, among others. It is an excellent resource for researchers and practitioners working on molecular biology and gene sequencing problems.
