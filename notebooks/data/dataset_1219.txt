Click Prediction Small
Tags: derived

This dataset is derived from the KDD Cup, specifically the Track from Kaggle. The data has been subsampled to a fraction of the original number of instances, with the majority class (click equals zero) downsampled to create a more balanced target feature ratio. The dataset focuses on advertisements displayed alongside search results in a search engine, aiming to predict whether users will click on these ads.

A search session contains information about the user identifier, the query issued by the user, ads displayed to the user, and a target feature indicating whether a user clicked at least one of the ads in the session. The number of ads shown to a user in a session is referred to as 'depth', while the order of an ad in the displayed list is called 'position'. Each ad is presented as a short text called 'title', followed by a slightly longer text called 'description', and a URL called 'display URL'.

To construct this dataset, each session was divided into multiple instances. Each instance describes an ad displayed under certain settings (depth and position). Instances with the same user identifier, ad identifier, query, and setting are merged. Both ads and users have additional properties located in separate data files that can be accessed using identifiers in the instances.

The dataset includes various features such as:
- Click: a binary variable indicating whether a user clicked on at least one ad
- Impression: the number of search sessions in which an ad was impressed by a user who issued a query
- URL hash: URL is hashed for anonymity
- Ad identifier
- Advertiser identifier: some advertisers consistently optimize their ads, making their titles and descriptions more attractive
- Depth: number of ads displayed to a user in a session
- Position: order of an ad in the displayed list
- Query identifier: key to access additional query data
- Keyword identifier: key to access purchased keyword data
- Title identifier: key to access title data
- Description identifier: key to access description data
- User identifier: key to access user profile data, with zero denoting an unidentified user
