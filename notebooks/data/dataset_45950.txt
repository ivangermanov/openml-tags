Heart Failure Prediction

Tags: Heart Failure, Clinical Records, Mortality Prediction

This dataset, named "Heart Failure Clinical Records", consists of clinical records of patients with heart failure. It includes various attributes such as the patient's age, presence of anemia, creatinine phosphokinase levels, diabetes status, ejection fraction, presence of high blood pressure, platelet count, serum creatinine levels, serum sodium levels, gender, smoking habits, follow-up time, and a binary indicator for death event.

Attribute Description:

* Age of the patient
* Presence of anemia (no or yes)
* Level of creatinine phosphokinase in the blood
* Presence of diabetes (no or yes)
* Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction
* Presence of high blood pressure (no or yes)
* Platelet count in the blood
* Level of serum creatinine in the blood
* Level of serum sodium in the blood
* Gender of the patient (female or male)
* Smoking status of the patient (no or yes)
* Follow-up time
* Indicator of death occurrence during the follow-up period (no or yes)

Use Case:
This dataset can be used for analyzing the relationship between various clinical attributes and the occurrence of death events in patients with heart failure. It can help in predicting the risk factors associated with heart failure mortality, enabling healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients and provide targeted interventions to improve their outcomes.
