Timing Attack Dataset: Ten Microsecond Delay Created on September Eighteenth, Two Thousand Twenty-Two

Tags: Bleichenbacher Timing Attack

This dataset contains features extracted from network traffic related to the Bleichenbacher timing attack. The attack is a type of side-channel attack that targets the RSA decryption process.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset includes attributes related to the Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect messages. These attributes describe various aspects of the TCP and TLS protocols, such as source and destination ports, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, window sizes, and flags.

The Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and various flags.

The TLS Alert attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and various flags, as well as the TLS record content type, length, alert message level, and description.

The TCP Disconnect attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and various flags.

Features:

* Label
* Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes
* TLS Alert attributes
* TCP Disconnect attributes

Fold ID and vulnerable classes are also included in the dataset.
