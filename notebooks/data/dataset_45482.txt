Tags: Bleichenbacher Timing Attack

Attribute Descriptions:

This dataset contains various attributes related to Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect messages.

The attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream index, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flags, nonce flags, congestion window reduced flags, explicit congestion notification echo flags, urgent flags, acknowledgment flags, push flags, reset flags, synchronize flags, finish flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, message order, record content type, record length, alert message level, and alert message description.

These attributes provide detailed information about the packets exchanged during the Bleichenbacher timing attack.

The dataset is divided into three main categories: CCS0 (Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement), TLS0 (TLS Alert), and DISC0/DISC1 (TCP Disconnect).

Each category has its own set of attributes, providing a comprehensive view of the packet exchange process.

Keywords: Bleichenbacher timing attack, Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, TLS Alert, TCP Disconnect, packet analysis, network security.
