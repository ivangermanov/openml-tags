QSAR-TID-100853 Tags: Mathematics, MTLQSAR, Physical Sciences, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand eight hundred fifty three, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and many others.

This dataset was created during the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The drug target is homeodomain interacting protein kinase three, also known as androgen receptor interacting nuclear protein kinase, anpk, dyrk six, fas interacting serine threonine protein kinase, fist, and other synonyms.

It belongs to the species homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, cmgc protein kinase group, cmgc protein kinase dyrk family, cmgc protein kinase hipk subfamily.

It has various functions and processes including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

It is involved in various biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, mRNA transcription, phosphorylation, peptidyl serine phosphorylation, peptidyl threonine phosphorylation, negative regulation of apoptotic process, and negative regulation of JUN kinase activity.
