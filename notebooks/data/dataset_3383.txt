QSAR-TID-12718 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12718. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features of the dataset include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Sgk1, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as Serum/Glucocorticoid-Regulated Kinase 1 and is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of cell growth, protein phosphorylation, and sodium ion transport.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane, and is involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of cell migration, phosphorylation, and signal transduction.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery, particularly those interested in the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Sgk1 target.
