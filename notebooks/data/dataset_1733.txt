The QSAR-TID-12071 dataset is a collection of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data related to the life science field of study. It consists of activity values of various compounds on the drug target Cyclin-Dependent Kinase One, which is a single protein preferred name. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

The dataset contains one thousand eight hundred fifty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature named Median PXc50. These features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Cyclin-Dependent Kinase One is a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly in the G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle. It plays a vital role in the phosphorylation of proteins, leading to the activation of downstream targets.

The expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase One is regulated by various mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation, post-translational modification, and protein-protein interactions. Its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

Keywords: QSAR, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase One, MetaQSAR, cell cycle regulation, phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions, disease implication.
