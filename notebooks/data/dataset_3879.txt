QSAR-TID-11426 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11426. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Dopamine D2 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as the D(2) dopamine receptor and is a member of the monoamine receptor family. It is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and regulation of dopamine secretion.

The receptor is localized to the Golgi membrane, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and membrane, and is involved in the glutamatergic synapse. It has various functions, including dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity, coupled via Gi/Go, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity.

The receptor is also involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, signal transduction, regulation of dopamine secretion, and regulation of potassium ion transport.
