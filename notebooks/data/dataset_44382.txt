Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratified argument determines whether the sampling should be stratified or not.

The function starts by getting the unique classes in the dataset and selecting a random subset of them. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the data. Next, it selects a random subset of columns and uses these columns to subset the data. Finally, it selects a random subset of rows and uses these rows to subset the data.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
