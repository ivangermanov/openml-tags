QSAR-TID-11280 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11280. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has 1584 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The target protein, Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5, is a single protein that belongs to the family C G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including neurotransmitter receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential.

The receptor is primarily located in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity.

Several compounds have been identified as modulators of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5, including Basimglurant, STX107, AZD2066, AZD2516, and Mavoglurant, which have been shown to have varying degrees of efficacy in modulating the receptor's activity.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5.
