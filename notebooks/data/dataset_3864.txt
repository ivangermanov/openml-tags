Myanmar Air Quality (2019 to 2020 October)
Tags: Context

Since Myanmar is one of the developing countries, a large number of factories have been set up and the number of cars has increased rapidly over the past few years. As a consequence, Myanmar's air quality has also been deteriorating dramatically during recent years. In fact, Myanmar's air quality reached fourth place among the worst air qualities globally.

Therefore, I created this dataset to analyze and attempt some predictions regarding this pressing issue. The data utilized in this dataset originates from PurpleAir.com and has been thoroughly cleaned using Power BI.

This dataset is part of a project initiated to participate in Myanmar's air quality visualization competitions. I would like to extend gratitude to those who collaborated with me on this endeavor.

It is my sincere hope that this dataset will contribute significantly to the field of data science and ultimately improve the air quality of Myanmar.
