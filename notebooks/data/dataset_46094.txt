Parkinson Dataset
Tags: Description

This dataset, named "Parkinson's Data", encompasses a collection of voice measurement data from individuals, some of whom have Parkinson's disease. It includes a diverse range of voice signal attributes aimed at assisting in the early diagnosis and tracking of Parkinson's disease through non-invasive methods. The dataset contains several columns, including voice frequency measurements, such as average vocal fundamental frequency, maximum vocal fundamental frequency, and minimum vocal fundamental frequency, as well as measures of variation in voice frequency and amplitude, including jitter and shimmer. Additionally, the dataset includes metrics relevant to voice disorders, covering various aspects of voice quality and dynamics, such as noise components in the voice and nonlinear dynamical measurements. A binary indicator, status, denotes the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease.

Attribute Description:

Average vocal fundamental frequency, maximum vocal fundamental frequency, and minimum vocal fundamental frequency are measures of voice frequency. Various measures of variation in frequency, including jitter and jitter absolute, are also included. Different measures of variation in amplitude, such as shimmer and shimmer in decibels, are also part of the dataset. Ratios depicting noise components in the voice, including noise to harmonics ratio and harmonics to noise ratio, are included. Nonlinear dynamical measurements, such as recurrence period density entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis, and pitch period entropy, are also part of the dataset.

Use Case:

This dataset can serve multiple purposes, ranging from academic research in biomedical voice signal processing to the practical development of diagnostic tools for early detection of Parkinson's disease. It can be utilized by data scientists and researchers to devise machine learning models capable of distinguishing between healthy individuals and those affected by Parkinson's disease based on voice measurements alone. Furthermore, the dataset can contribute to enhancing our understanding of how Parkinson's disease impacts voice characteristics, aiding in the development of new therapies and treatments.
