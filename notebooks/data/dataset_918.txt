Hepatitis C Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset contains samples characterized by values of various attributes, which represent measurements from DNA microarrays. The attributes are all numeric and have been normalized in some way, resulting in similar distributions of attribute values throughout the dataset.

The dataset consists of multiple classes, with each sample assigned to one of these classes. The number of classes varies, ranging from two to ten.

All attributes in this dataset are numeric, providing a comprehensive set of measurements from DNA microarrays. These measurements have been normalized to ensure consistency throughout the dataset.

The Hepatitis C dataset is part of the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge, which includes various datasets containing between one hundred and four hundred samples, characterized by thousands of attributes.
