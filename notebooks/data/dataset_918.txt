Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled as oz followed by a number. The final feature is labeled binaryClass.

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the original target feature. Instances with values below this mean are classified as positive ('P'), while those above or equal to the mean are classified as negative ('N'). This binarization transforms the problem from a regression task to a binary classification task.

The dataset is intended for use in various studies and mythbusting exercises, as indicated by its tags. It likely contains experimental or observational data across multiple dimensions, represented by the fifty 'oz' features. The binary classification feature allows for analysis of how these various factors contribute to a positive or negative outcome.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The original source and date of creation are unknown, which may be important contextual information for some analyses.
