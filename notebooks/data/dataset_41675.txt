The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. It is entirely fictitious and supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game.

In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features, or attributes, that measure different aspects of the instance. In this case, there are several attributes that describe the weather conditions. These attributes include the Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Windy conditions. The outcome of these attributes determines whether it is suitable to Play or Not.
