Abstract: Communities within the United States. The data combines socioeconomic data from the US Census, law enforcement data from the US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the FBI UCR.

Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate
Attribute Characteristics: Real
Associated Tasks: Regression
Number of Instances: 
Number of Attributes: 
Missing Values? Yes
Area: Social
Date Donated: 

Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime, plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units.

The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.

Data is described based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range using an Unsupervised, equal interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value because most communities are small). An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized version of that value. The normalization preserves rough ratios of values within an attribute (double the value for double the population within the available precision except for extreme values). However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values between attributes (it would not be meaningful to compare the value for white per capita with the value for black per capita for a community).

A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.

Features include: state, county, community, community name, fold, population, household size, race percentages, age percentages, urban statistics, income metrics, employment data, family statistics, immigration information, housing characteristics, education levels, and various law enforcement metrics.

The dataset aims to predict violent crimes per capita based on these community and law enforcement variables. It provides a rich set of features for analyzing factors potentially related to crime rates across different communities in the United States.
