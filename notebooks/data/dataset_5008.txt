**Diabetes Bayesian Network**

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a machine learning model that represents complex relationships between various factors influencing diabetes. This network has been learned using the bnlearn algorithm.

**Repository Reference**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository.

**Network Characteristics**

The Diabetes Bayesian Network consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, indicating a high level of complexity. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, suggesting that each node has a limited number of parents. The average degree of each node is moderate, indicating a decent level of connectivity within the network.

**Dataset Description**

This dataset is related to diabetes and consists of various features that are relevant to understanding the disease. Some of these features include meal, cholesterol, insulin absorption, glucose production, and renal clearance.

**Features**

Some of the key features of this dataset include meal composition, cholesterol levels, insulin absorption rates, glucose production rates, and renal clearance rates. These features are essential for modeling the complex dynamics of diabetes.
