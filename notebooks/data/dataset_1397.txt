QSAR-TID-30008 Dataset: Computational Universe, MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID three thousand eight. It has eight hundred thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four one, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four two, ..., FCFP six one thousand twenty-four nine hundred twenty-five, and nine hundred twenty-six more...

Ephrin type-A receptor two is a single protein preferred name, also known as Eck, Epithelial Cell Kinase, Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor Eck, and others. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and has a classification of enzyme kinase protein kinase TK protein kinase group tyrosine protein kinase Eph family.
