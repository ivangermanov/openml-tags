QSAR-TID-12708 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12708. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12708. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Melanocortin Receptor 1, which is a single protein target involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and melanin biosynthetic process.

The Melanocortin Receptor 1 is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor family and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including feeding behavior, pain perception, and tumor necrosis factor production. The receptor is also involved in the regulation of protein kinase A signaling, protein kinase B signaling, and protein kinase C signaling.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Melanocortin Receptor 1. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data that can be used to develop predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.
