Data Set Information: Each record represents an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of fifty-two cards. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), resulting in a total of ten predictive attributes. There is one Class attribute that describes the "Poker Hand". The order of cards is significant, which explains why there are four hundred and eighty possible Royal Flush hands as compared to four (one for each suit).

Attribute Information:
S "Suit of card" Ordinal representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}
C "Rank of card" Numerical representing (Ace, Two, Three, ... , Queen, King)

These attributes are repeated for each of the five cards in the hand.

CLASS "Poker Hand" Ordinal
Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand
One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards
Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards
Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards
Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps
Flush; five cards with the same suit
Full house; pair plus different rank three of a kind
Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards
Straight flush; straight plus flush
Royal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} plus flush
