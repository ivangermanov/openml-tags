Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem. The transformation process involved calculating the mean value of the original target feature and then categorizing instances based on whether their target value falls above or below this mean. Instances with target values lower than the mean are classified as positive ('P'), while those with values equal to or greater than the mean are classified as negative ('N').

The purpose of this binarization process is likely to simplify the original problem or to make it suitable for certain types of analysis or machine learning algorithms that work specifically with binary classification tasks. By converting a continuous or multi-class problem into a binary one, researchers can apply a different set of analytical techniques or compare results with other binary classification problems.

It's important to note that this dataset is derived from an earlier version, and users should refer to the original source for more detailed information about the data collection process, feature descriptions, and potential applications.
