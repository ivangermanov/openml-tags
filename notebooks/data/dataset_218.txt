Name: House L Tags: Census Data, Housing Prices, Demographics

This database was designed using data provided by the US Census Bureau, available through their Lookup Access service from the Summary Tape File. The data were collected as part of the US census and primarily consist of cumulative counts at various survey levels. For this dataset, the State-Place level was utilized, incorporating data from all states. Most counts were converted into appropriate proportions.

Multiple datasets were derived from this database, all focused on predicting the median house price in a region based on demographic composition and housing market conditions. The datasets vary in the number of attributes and the difficulty of the modeling task. Those labeled with "L" indicate lower task difficulty, where more correlated attributes were selected based on univariate smooth fit of the input on the target. Datasets labeled "H" present higher difficulty, with attributes chosen to increase modeling complexity due to higher variance or lower correlation between inputs and the target.

The original source of this data was the DELVE repository. It was later included in a collection of regression datasets.

This particular dataset, House L, contains cases with continuous attributes. The features include various demographic and housing-related proportions, culminating in the target variable of house price.
