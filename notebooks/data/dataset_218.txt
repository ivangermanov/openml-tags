House Eight L Dataset: Demographics, Economics 

This database was carefully crafted based on information provided by the United States Census Bureau, specifically from the Summary Tape File One, which was collected as part of the Nineteen Ninety US census. The data consists mainly of counts accumulated at various survey levels, with a focus on the State-Place level. Information from all fifty states was gathered for this dataset. To make the data more meaningful, most of the counts were transformed into suitable proportions.

There are four distinct datasets derived from this database: House Eight H, House Eight L, House Sixteen H, and House Sixteen L. All of these datasets share a common goal â€“ to predict the median price of houses in a given region based on its demographic makeup and the state of its housing market. The number in each dataset's name indicates the number of attributes present, while the letter suffix provides a rough estimate of the task's difficulty level. Datasets labeled as Low have attributes that are more closely correlated, making the task easier, whereas those labeled as High have attributes with higher variance or lower correlation, making the task more challenging.

The original source of this dataset is the DELVE repository of data, which has been made available through a collection of regression datasets.

Characteristics of this dataset include twenty-two thousand seven hundred eighty-four cases and nine continuous attributes.

Features of interest include population characteristics and housing market indicators.
