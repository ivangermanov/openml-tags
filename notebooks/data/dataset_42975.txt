Features: Ambient Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Ambient Humidity, Air Filter Difference Pressure, Gas Turbine Exhaust Pressure, Turbine Inlet Temperature, Turbine After Temperature, Compressor Discharge Pressure, Turbine Energy Yield, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides

The dataset contains instances of eleven sensor measures aggregated over one hour from a gas turbine located in Turkey's northwestern region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions, namely Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Oxides. The data comes from the same power plant as the dataset used for predicting hourly net energy yield. By contrast, this data is collected in another data range and includes gas turbine parameters, such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge Pressure, in addition to the ambient variables.

Note that the dates are not given in the instances, but the data are sorted in chronological order. See the attribute information and relevant paper for details. Kindly follow the protocol mentioned in the paper, using the first three years' data for training and cross-validation and the last two for testing, for reproducibility and comparability of works.

The dataset can be well used for predicting Turbine Energy Yield using ambient variables as features.
