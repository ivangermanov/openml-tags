QSAR-TID-10907 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10907. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1443 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein, Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PLK1, is a key regulator of mitosis and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PLK1 inhibitors, which have potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment.
