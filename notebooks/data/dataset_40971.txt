The Collins dataset is a collection of data used in the analysis of the Brown and Frown corpora for a doctoral dissertation titled Variations in Written English: Characterizing Authors' Rhetorical Language Choices Across Corpora of Published Texts.

The source of the corpora was the International Computer Archive of Modern English CD-ROM. The data were generated from the texts using tagging and visualization software called Docuscope.

The dataset includes variables such as the genre of each text assigned by the Brown corpus compilers, which is listed in the Genre column, and the corpus, which is listed in the Corpus column with one indicating the Brown corpus and two indicating the Frown corpus.

The dataset also includes features such as Text, First Person, Inner Thinking, Thinking Positively, Thinking Negatively, Thinking Ahead, Thinking Back, Reasoning, Sharing Social Ties, Direct Activity, Interacting, Notifying, Linear Guidance, Word Picture, Space Interval, Motion, Past Events, Time Interval, Shifting Events, and Text Coverage.

Note that the Genre and Corpus values together make up the target, and the Counter just counts documents within each category, so they should probably be ignored.

This dataset may be freely used and distributed for non-commercial purposes.
