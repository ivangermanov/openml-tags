The Collins dataset is a collection of data used in an analysis of the Brown and Frown corpora for a doctoral dissertation titled "Variations in Written English: Characterizing Authors' Rhetorical Language Choices Across Corpora of Published Texts". The source of the corpora was the ICAME CD-ROM, and the data were generated from the texts using tagging and visualization software, Docuscope.
