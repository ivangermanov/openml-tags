Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed Four Dataset 

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset, followed by stratified sampling of rows.

The subsampling function used to generate this dataset takes several arguments, including a seed value for reproducibility, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean flag indicating whether to use stratification. In this case, the seed value was four, the maximum number of rows was two thousand, the maximum number of columns was one hundred, the maximum number of classes was ten, and stratification was used.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, which were selected uniformly at random from the available columns. The class labels were also sampled uniformly, with probabilities proportional to their frequencies in the original dataset. The stratification step ensured that the resulting dataset retained an approximately equal distribution of class labels.

The dataset includes a set of features, although they are not easily interpretable due to their naming convention. These features are accompanied by a phase label, which represents the target variable for machine learning models.
