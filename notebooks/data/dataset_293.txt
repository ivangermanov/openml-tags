Covertype Dataset

Tags: Forest Cover Type Prediction, Cartographic Variables, Ecological Processes

This dataset, known as the covertype dataset, is a binary version of the famous forest cover type prediction problem. It was retrieved from the LibSVM repository and has undergone preprocessing to transform it from a multiclass to a binary classification task.

The dataset aims to predict forest cover type using only cartographic variables, without relying on remotely sensed data. The actual forest cover type for each observation (a 30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey and US Forest Service sources.

The study area encompasses four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human caused disturbances, allowing the existing forest cover types to be more reflective of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

The wilderness areas included in the study are Neota, Rawah, Comanche Peak, and Cache la Poudre. Each area has distinct characteristics in terms of elevation and primary tree species. Neota likely has the highest mean elevation, followed by Rawah and Comanche Peak, with Cache la Poudre having the lowest. The primary tree species vary across the areas, with spruce/fir dominating in Neota, lodgepole pine in Rawah and Comanche Peak, and a mix of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and cottonwood/willow in Cache la Poudre.

The dataset contains both quantitative and qualitative variables. Quantitative variables include elevation, aspect, slope, distance to hydrology, distance to roadways, hillshade indices, and distance to fire points. Qualitative variables are represented by binary columns indicating wilderness area designation and soil type.

The forest cover types to be predicted are Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood/Willow, Aspen, Douglas fir, and Krummholz. The data is provided in raw form, without scaling, and includes binary columns for qualitative independent variables.

This dataset is valuable for studying the relationship between cartographic features and forest cover types in areas with minimal human intervention. It allows for the exploration of ecological processes and their impact on forest composition across different wilderness areas with varying elevations and environmental conditions.
