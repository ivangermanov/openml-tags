This dataset, known as BNG (wine), is an artificial dataset used for study purposes. It contains various features related to wine composition and characteristics, including alcohol content, malic acid levels, ash content, alcalinity of ash, magnesium concentration, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, optical density ratios of diluted wines, and proline content. These features provide a comprehensive profile of different wine samples, allowing for analysis and classification of wine types based on their chemical properties.
