Vertebra Column - 2 Classes

Abstract:
This data set contains values for six biomechanical features used to classify orthopedic patients into two classes, namely normal or abnormal.

Data Set Information:
This biomedical data set was built during a medical residence period in the Group of Applied Research in Orthopedics of the Centre Medico-Chirurgical de Readaptation des Massues, Lyon, France. The data has been organized in two different but related classification tasks. The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of three categories: normal, disk hernia, or spondylolisthesis. For the second task, the categories disk hernia and spondylolisthesis were merged into a single category labeled as abnormal. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of two categories: normal or abnormal.

Attribute Information:
Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine. These attributes include pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is used for the class labels: normal, disk hernia, spondylolisthesis, and abnormal.

Relevant Papers:
The analysis of the sagittal balance of the spine and pelvis using shape and orientation parameters has been previously studied. Additionally, the application of ensembles of classifiers to the diagnosis of pathologies of the vertebral column has been comparatively analyzed. Furthermore, diagnostic of pathology on the vertebral column with embedded reject option has been explored.
