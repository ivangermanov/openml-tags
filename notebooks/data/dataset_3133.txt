QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Melanocortin receptor, a single protein target found in Mus musculus. This receptor is classified under various Gene Ontology categories, including cytoplasm, plasma membrane, G protein coupled receptor activity, melanocortin receptor activity, and peptide hormone binding. It is involved in numerous biological processes such as regulation of heart rate, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, regulation of blood pressure, circadian regulation of gene expression, and regulation of feeding behavior.

The Melanocortin receptor is associated with several database entries and classifications, including Expression Atlas, canSAR Target, Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. It plays roles in peptide ligand binding receptors and G alpha signaling events.

This QSAR dataset provides valuable information for studying the activity of compounds on the Melanocortin receptor, which could be useful for drug discovery and understanding various physiological processes regulated by this receptor.
