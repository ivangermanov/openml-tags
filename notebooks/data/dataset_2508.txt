The Spellman Yeast dataset is a collection of two-color spotted cDNA array data from a series of experiments designed to identify which genes in yeast are cell cycle regulated. This dataset explores the complex relationships between various genes and their roles in regulating the cell cycle.

The dataset includes features related to different genes, including CLN3, CLB, CDC15, and CDC28, which play critical roles in regulating the cell cycle. The dataset also includes features related to Alpha Factor, Elutriation, and other processes involved in the cell cycle.

By analyzing this dataset, researchers can gain insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern the cell cycle and identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
