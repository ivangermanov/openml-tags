The QSAR-TID-10273 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One B Angiotensin II Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including identifiers and class features.

The features represent FCFP Six One Zero Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains information about the Type One B Angiotensin II Receptor, a single protein preferred name, also known as Agtr One B, Angiotensin Two Type One Receptor B, and At One B. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR angiotensin receptor.

This receptor is responsible for various biological processes including blood vessel development, response to hypoxia, kidney development, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by circulatory renin-angiotensin, and many others. It is also involved in several cellular components including plasma membrane and membrane.
