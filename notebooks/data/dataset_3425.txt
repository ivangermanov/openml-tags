IEEE 80211 AA GATS Dataset 

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset showcases the downlink goodput for unicast and multicast transmissions with varying group sizes and network loads on an IEEE 802.11 ac network simulated using NS-3. The simulations utilize different IEEE 802.11 AA Group Address Translation Service (GATS) protocols.

The dataset features include the following parameters: 
Level, Number of Multicast Stations, Number of Unicast Stations, Index, Average Downlink Data Rate, Average Uplink Data Rate, Downlink Multicast Delay, Downlink Unicast Delay, Uplink Delay, Goodput Downlink Multicast, Goodput Downlink Unicast, Goodput Uplink, Injected Multicast Traffic, Injected Unicast Downlink Traffic, Injected Unicast Uplink Traffic, Multicast Mode, Occupancy Ratio, Downlink Occupancy Ratio, Uplink Occupancy Ratio, Number of Retries, Retransmitted Bytes over Unicast Downlink, Retransmitted Bytes over Unicast Uplink, Retransmission Share over Downlink, Retransmission Share over Uplink, Received Bytes over Downlink Multicast, Received Bytes over Downlink Unicast, Received Bytes over Uplink, Throughput over Multicast Downlink, Throughput over Unicast Downlink, Throughput over Uplink, Time, Transmitted Bytes over Multicast Downlink, Transmitted Bytes over Unicast Downlink, and Transmitted Bytes over Uplink.
