Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample 1.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 

This network represents a probabilistic causal model in medicine, specifically focused on the diagnosis of liver disorders. It consists of a large number of variables related to patient symptoms, medical history, and laboratory test results.

The network has a complex structure, with many variables influencing each other through conditional probability distributions. This allows for the modeling of complex relationships between different factors affecting liver health.

Some of the variables included in the model represent patient symptoms, such as anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and pain. Others represent laboratory test results, including triglyceride levels, amylase levels, and bilirubin levels. The model also takes into account demographic information, such as age and sex.

The Hepar2 network has been used to study the diagnosis of various liver diseases, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. It provides a powerful tool for medical researchers and clinicians to better understand the complex interactions between different factors affecting liver health.

Features: jaundice, itching, steatosis, joint pain, spider naevi, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, edema, and ascites.

Keywords: Bayesian network, liver disease, diagnosis, medicine, probability, conditional probability, symptoms, laboratory tests, demographics.
