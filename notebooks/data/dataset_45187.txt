Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample 1.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network consists of seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, with a total of one thousand four hundred fifty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, and the average degree is approximately three point five one. The maximum in-degree is six.

The Hepar2 Bayesian Network is a probabilistic causal model in medicine, specifically designed for the diagnosis of liver disorders.

The network features a range of variables, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint pain, platelet count, very high ammonia levels, spider naevi, spleen size, age, jaundice, hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody, chronic hepatitis, itching, steatosis, sex, history of injections, hepatitis B surface antigen, cirrhosis, palmar erythema, pain, hepatitis C antibody, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase, rheumatic hepatitis, gallstones, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, primary biliary cirrhosis, alanine transaminase, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, aspartate transaminase, hepatitis B e antigen, skin manifestations, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, hepatitis B core antibody, right upper quadrant pressure, alcohol consumption, lupus erythematosus cells, antimitochondrial antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites, hospitalization, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, liver density, blood transfusion, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, edge, edema, fatty liver, alcoholism, and surgery.
