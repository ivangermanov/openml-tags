Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes based on their frequency in the data. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of columns uniformly at random. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. The function returns a dataset with the selected data and the corresponding categorical mask.
