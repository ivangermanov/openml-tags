Fish Catch Dataset: A Binarized Version for Study Purposes

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The Fish Catch dataset comprises various features that describe different aspects of fish species. These features include the species type, three different length measurements, height, width, and sex.

This dataset is suitable for studies in chemistry and life science, particularly those focused on understanding the characteristics of different fish species.
