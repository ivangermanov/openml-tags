QSAR-TID-11635 Dataset Description:

The QSAR-TID-11635 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data for several compounds targeting drug target TID: 11635. This dataset has one thousand three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset shows activity values in terms of pseudo-pCI fifty for several compounds on drug target TID: one one six three five.

The target classification for this dataset is enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, AGC protein kinase group, AGC protein kinase PKC family, and AGC protein kinase PKC alpha subfamily.

The preferred name for this target is Protein Kinase C Alpha, and its synonyms include PKCA, PKC-A, PKC-alpha, PRKACA, and PRKCA.

The organism species for this target is Homo sapiens.

Expression Atlas information is available for this target, including component information for nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, plasma membrane, membrane, mitochondrial membrane, alphav-beta three integrin-PKC alpha complex, ciliary basal body, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm.
