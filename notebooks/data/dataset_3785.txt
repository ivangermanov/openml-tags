QSAR-TID-100852 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100852. The dataset has seven hundred forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are useful for predicting the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The features in the dataset are primarily molecular fingerprints, which are binary vectors that represent the presence or absence of specific molecular substructures. These fingerprints are generated using the FCFP algorithm, which is a widely used method for generating molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing predictive models for drug targets, particularly those involved in the Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase two pathway. The dataset provides a large collection of compounds with activity values, which can be used to train and validate machine learning models.

Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase two is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcription, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. It is a key regulator of the transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset is part of the Expression Atlas, which is a comprehensive collection of gene expression data from various sources. It is also part of the GoComponent, which provides information on the cellular components of biological processes. Additionally, the dataset is linked to various other databases, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam, which provide information on protein sequences, structures, and functions.
