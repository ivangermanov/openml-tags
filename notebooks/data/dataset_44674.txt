Phishing Websites Dataset Seed One

This dataset is a subsample of the Phishing Websites dataset, generated with a seed of one. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns to reduce the dataset size.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several arguments, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample. The function uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility.

The subsampling process first involves selecting a subset of classes. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, the function selects a random subset of classes, weighted by their frequency in the dataset. The function then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns. The function selects a random subset of column indices, sorts them, and filters the data accordingly.

Finally, the function stratifies the sample according to the target variable if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows. The function uses the train-test split function from scikit-learn to split the data into a subset of the desired size, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, including whether the URL has an IP address, the URL length, the presence of a shortening service, and the presence of an at symbol, among others.
