QSAR-TID-12720 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12720. The dataset has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12720. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Vasopressin V2 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as Antidiuretic hormone receptor, AVPR2, AVPR V2, Renal-type arginine vasopressin receptor, and V2R. The receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The dataset provides information about the expression of the Vasopressin V2 receptor in different tissues and cells. The receptor is expressed in the endosome, plasma membrane, membrane, endocytic vesicle, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by vasopressin, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, positive regulation of gene expression, cellular response to hormone stimulus, response to cytokine, and positive regulation of vasoconstriction.

The dataset also provides information about the receptor's function, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, vasopressin receptor activity, and peptide binding. The receptor is involved in various pathways, including Vasopressin-like receptors, G alpha (s) signalling events, Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins, Cargo recognition for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and Clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
