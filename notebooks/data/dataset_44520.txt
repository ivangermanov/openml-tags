Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It does this by first uniformly sampling classes from the dataset, then uniformly sampling columns, and finally uniformly sampling rows. The function uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility.

The function first gets the unique classes in the dataset and selects a specified number of classes to keep. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns from the dataset, selecting a specified number of columns to keep. Finally, it uniformly samples rows from the dataset, selecting a specified number of rows to keep.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
