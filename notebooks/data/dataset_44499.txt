Credit-G Dataset Subsampling with Seed One

This dataset is a subsample of the credit-g dataset, generated with a seed of one. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns to reduce the dataset size. The resulting dataset has a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes.

The subsampling process began by selecting classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded ten, a random sample of ten classes was chosen, with the probability of selection proportional to the value counts of each class. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to subset the data.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled if the number of columns exceeded one hundred. A random sample of one hundred column indices was chosen, and the corresponding columns were selected. The column indices were sorted to maintain the original column order.

Finally, if the number of rows exceeded two thousand, the data was stratified and split using the train test split function from scikit-learn. The stratification was based on the target variable, and the random state was set to the seed value.

The resulting dataset contains the following features: checking status, duration, credit history, purpose, credit amount, savings status, employment, installment commitment, personal status, other parties, residence since, property magnitude, age, other payment plans, housing, existing credits, job, number of dependents, own telephone, foreign worker, and class.
