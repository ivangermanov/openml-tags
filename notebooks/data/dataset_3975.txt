This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: eleven thousand one hundred twenty-six, and it has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target eleven thousand one hundred twenty-six. It has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.

Subtilisin/kexin type seven is a single protein preferred name, also known as lymphoma proprotein convertase, PC eight, and others. It is an enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease SB clan/serine protease S eight B subfamily.

It is involved in proteolysis, protein processing, and peptide hormone processing. It has serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug target, single protein, enzyme, protease, serine protease.
