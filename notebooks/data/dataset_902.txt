Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This process transforms the continuous data into a binary classification problem, allowing for more straightforward analysis and interpretation of results. The binarization technique employed here provides a simplified representation of the original dataset while preserving the essential characteristics of the underlying data distribution.

Features: The dataset includes several features, some of which may be abbreviated or encoded. The final feature, binary Class, represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process described above.
