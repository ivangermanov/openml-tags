The QSAR-TID-17107 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17107. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. The features represent fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

The dataset contains information about cathepsin D, which is a single protein with preferred name cathepsin D. It has synonyms such as cathepsin D CTSD. The organism associated with this protein is Bos taurus, and it belongs to the species group no protein target classification one enzyme/protease/aspartic protease/aspartic protease AA clan/aspartic protease A1A subfamily.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis. It has molecular functions such as aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It is located in cellular components such as extracellular region, extracellular space, lysosome, and melanosome.
