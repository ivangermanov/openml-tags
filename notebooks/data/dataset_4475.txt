Subsampling of the dataset Steel Plates Fault with a specified seed value generates a new dataset.

This generated dataset has been created using the following source code:

The function `subsample` takes in several parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification.

Within this function, the dataset is first filtered to select a specified number of classes. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, a subset of classes is randomly selected based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset.

Next, the dataset is filtered to include only the columns corresponding to the selected classes. The column selection process is also randomized to ensure uniform sampling.

If the resulting dataset still has more rows than the specified maximum, a stratified sampling approach is employed to reduce the number of rows while maintaining class balance.

Finally, the categorical columns are converted to strings, and the resulting dataset is returned along with its corresponding metadata.

Features included in this dataset include various attributes related to steel plates.
