**Meta Album Subcellular Human Protein Dataset (Micro)**

This dataset is a subset of the Subcellular dataset in the Protein Atlas project. The original dataset stems from the Human Protein Atlas Image Classification Kaggle competition. The dataset comprises images of human cells, each of which belongs to one or more out of twenty-eight classes. The labels correspond to protein organelle localizations.

For Meta Album, we performed two modifications: we turned the dataset into a multi-class dataset by dropping all images belonging to more than a single class and also those images that belong to classes with less than forty members; we converted the remaining images into RGB simply by dropping the yellow channel; this was also a common practice in the competition. Finally, and as for all datasets in Meta Album, the images from the original dataset were resized to a smaller image size.
