Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 3.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 

This dataset is a massive discrete Bayesian network, comprising a large number of nodes and arcs. The network has a significant number of parameters, with an average Markov blanket size and average degree. The maximum in-degree of the network is also notable.

The Munin dataset is an expert EMG assistant, designed to provide assistance in electromyography. It is a comprehensive system that integrates multiple features and variables to provide a detailed analysis.

Features of the dataset include muscle activity, electromyography signals, and various other physiological and clinical parameters. These features are used to analyze and diagnose muscle disorders and diseases.
