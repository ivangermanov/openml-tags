QSAR-TID-11056 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Descriptors which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pIC Fifty.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September Two Thousand Fifteen.

The preferred name for this target is Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Six, also known as G Protein-Coupled Receptor One F, Grm Six, Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Six, mGluR Six, and Mglur Six.

It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified as a single protein belonging to family C G protein-coupled receptors, specifically neurotransmitter receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors.

Keywords: QSAR, Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor, Fingerprint Molecular Descriptors, Pipeline Pilot, MetaQSAR.
