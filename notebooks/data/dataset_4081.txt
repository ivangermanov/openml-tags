QSAR-TID-100949 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100949. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature, representing FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for machine learning and cheminformatics research.

The dataset contains information about the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Seven, a single protein also known as Big MAP Kinase One, BMK One, ERK Five, and ERK-Five. It is an enzyme that belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase MAPK family.

The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Seven plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle, signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and cell differentiation. It is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammation.
