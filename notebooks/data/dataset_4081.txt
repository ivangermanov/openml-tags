QSAR-TID-100949 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Seven, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Seven. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Seven is a single protein, also known as Big MAP Kinase One, BMK One, ERK Five, and ERK-Five. It is a protein kinase that belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and MAPK family. It is involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle, signal transduction, and protein phosphorylation.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction of biological activities of small molecules.
