QSAR-TID-30036 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30036. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30036. The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each molecule, and Median PXc50, which is a measure of the molecule's activity.

The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the structure of molecules. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is a software tool used for generating molecular fingerprints and other molecular descriptors.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. This means that the fingerprints are complete and do not contain any missing values.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which is a collection of QSAR datasets used for machine learning and data analysis.

Scraped Data:
