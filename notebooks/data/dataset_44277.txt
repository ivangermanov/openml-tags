**Meta-Album RSD Micro Tags**

The Meta-Album RSD Micro dataset is a collection of remote sensing images gathered from Google Earth and Tianditu. This dataset comprises forty-six scene categories, with a total of numerous images. Each scene category contains between five hundred and three thousand images. The original resolutions are two hundred fifty-six by two hundred fifty-six pixels or five hundred twelve by five hundred twelve pixels. We have created a preprocessed version of RSD for Meta-Album by resizing the original dataset to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels.
