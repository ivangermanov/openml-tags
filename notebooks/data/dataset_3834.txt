This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase II Alpha Prime, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset provides information about the Casein Kinase II Alpha Prime, which is a single protein and an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group/other protein kinase CK2 family. It is found in Homo sapiens species and belongs to the protein target classification one.

The dataset also includes information about the expression atlas, gene ontology components, functions, and processes related to the Casein Kinase II Alpha Prime. These include chromatin, acrosomal vesicle, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, protein kinase CK2 complex, PcG protein complex, and many others.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about the gene ontology functions, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

Furthermore, the dataset includes information about the gene ontology processes, such as protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, cell cycle, spermatogenesis, Wnt signaling pathway, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation, cerebral cortex development, regulation of cell cycle, liver regeneration, regulation of autophagy of mitochondrion, positive regulation of protein targeting to mitochondrion, regulation of chromosome separation, negative regulation of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, and negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway.
