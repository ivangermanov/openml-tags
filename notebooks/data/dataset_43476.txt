Three Million Sudoku Puzzles with Ratings

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset contains three million Sudoku puzzles along with their corresponding solutions. The level of difficulty varies significantly - some puzzles can be solved effortlessly by a beginner, whereas others will pose a formidable challenge even to the most experienced solvers. Most puzzles have between twenty-three and twenty-six clues. The minimum number of clues present in this dataset is nineteen, and the maximum is thirty-one. It has been demonstrated that seventeen is the minimum number of clues required for a valid, uniquely solvable Sudoku puzzle. However, these puzzles are extremely rare and difficult to find, which is why they are not included in this dataset.

Each row of the dataset comprises the number of clues and an estimated difficulty rating. The difficulty rating is computed by an automated solver, and it is based on the average search tree depth over ten attempts. Forty-three of the puzzles have a difficulty rating of zero, implying that they can be solved utilizing a simple scanning technique. The highest difficulty rating present in this dataset is eight point five. 

The puzzles were generated using a Sudoku generator and solver.
