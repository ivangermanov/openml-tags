This dataset, Three Million Sudoku Puzzles with Ratings, contains a vast collection of Sudoku puzzles and their corresponding solutions. The level of difficulty varies greatly, ranging from puzzles that can be easily solved by a beginner to those that will challenge even the most experienced solvers. Most puzzles have a moderate number of clues, but some have as few as nineteen or as many as thirty-one. It has been demonstrated that a minimum of seventeen clues is required for a valid, uniquely solvable Sudoku puzzle, although such puzzles are extremely rare and not included in this dataset.

Each row of the dataset includes information about the number of clues and an estimated difficulty rating. The difficulty rating is computed by an automated solver, based on the average search tree depth over multiple attempts. A small number of puzzles have a difficulty rating of zero, indicating that they can be solved using a simple scanning technique. The highest difficulty rating is also included, representing the most challenging puzzles in the dataset.

The puzzles were generated using a sophisticated Sudoku generator and solver. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of puzzles, each with its unique characteristics and level of difficulty.
