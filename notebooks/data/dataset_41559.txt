The YouTube Personality Dataset consists of a collection of behavioral features, speech transcriptions, and personality impression scores for a set of YouTube vloggers who explicitly show themselves in front of a webcam, talking about a wide range of topics including personal issues, politics, movies, books, and more. There is no content-related restriction, and the language used in the videos is natural and diverse.

The dataset includes various features, such as pitch, confidence in pitch, spectral entropy, amplitude peak, energy, voiced segments, segment length, time spent speaking, voice rate, number of turns, and entropy of horizontal optical flow. Additionally, it includes demographic information, such as gender, as well as personality traits, including extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness.
