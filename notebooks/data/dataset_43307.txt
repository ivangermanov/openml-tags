Hello, my name is Ben, and I am pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics at Jain University in Bangalore. As part of our practical sessions, we work with datasets in Python and R. Our faculties provide us with these datasets to work on, and I would like to share one of the datasets our class worked on.

This dataset consists of placement data of students in a campus, which includes their secondary and higher secondary school percentages and specializations. It also includes their degree specializations, types, and work experience, as well as the salary offers they received after being placed.

I would like to acknowledge the efforts of our professor in providing this dataset for us to train in R programming.

The questions that arise from this dataset are: Which factor influences a candidate in getting placed? Does the percentage of marks obtained in school and college matter for one to get placed? Which degree specialization is in high demand by corporate companies?

To answer these questions, we can play with the data by conducting various statistical tests.

The dataset features include: student identification number, gender, secondary school percentage, secondary school board, higher secondary school percentage, higher secondary school board, higher secondary school stream, degree percentage, degree type, work experience, entrance test percentage, specialization, MBA percentage, status, and salary.

Keywords: campus recruitment, placement data, business analytics, Python, R programming, dataset analysis, statistical tests, degree specialization, work experience, salary offers.
