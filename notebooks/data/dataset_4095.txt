This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-10355, falls under the categories of Chemistry, Culture, and MTLQSAR, specifically study three. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values in units of pseudo-pCI50 for various compounds related to the drug target identified as TID: 10355. This dataset comprises fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature labeled as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Typically, generating fingerprints does not require missing value imputation since all bits are produced.

The drug target associated with this dataset is the melatonin receptor one B, also referred to as Mel-one-B-R, Mel-one-b receptor, or melatonin receptor type one B. This receptor is classified as a single protein belonging to the family A G-protein coupled receptor group, small molecule receptor subcategory, and monoamine-derivative receptor subclass.

In terms of biological processes, this receptor is involved in signal transduction and G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways. Its molecular function includes G-protein coupled receptor activity and melatonin receptor activity. The cellular component associated with this receptor is the plasma membrane.
