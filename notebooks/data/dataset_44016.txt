Brazilian Houses

Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset contains houses to rent with thirteen different features. Please note that some values in the dataset can be considered as outliers for further analyses. Bear in mind that the Web Crawler was used only to get the data, so it's possible that errors in the original data exist.

Changes in data between versions of the dataset may occur since the Web Crawler was run in different days for each version of the dataset, resulting in differences like added or deleted houses, as well as added cities.

This dataset corresponds to the second version of the original dataset. The value 'hyphen' in the attribute floor was replaced by 'zero' as the data contributor stated that this refers to houses with just one floor.

Features: area, rooms, bathroom, parking spaces, homeowners association, rent amount, property tax, fire insurance, total.

Keywords: Brazilian houses, rent, features, outliers, web crawler, dataset versions.
