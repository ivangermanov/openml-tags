**Electricity**

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. The Electricity dataset is a widely used dataset that contains forty-five thousand three hundred twelve instances dated from May seventh nineteen ninety-six to December fifth nineteen ninety-eight. In this market, prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to alleviate fluctuations.

The dataset contains each example referring to a period of thirty minutes, i.e., there are forty-eight instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has eight fields: the day of the week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label. The class label identifies the change of the price in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours and removes the impact of longer-term price trends.

The data was normalized. The dataset contains the following information: the date, which is normalized between zero and one; the day of the week; the period, which is the time of the measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours, normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity price, normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity demand, normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity price, normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity demand, normalized between zero and one; and the scheduled electricity transfer between both states, normalized between zero and one.
