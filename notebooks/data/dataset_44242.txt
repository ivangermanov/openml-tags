**Meta Album Plant Village Dataset (Micro)**

The Plant Village dataset contains camera photos of seventeen crop leaves. The original image resolution is two hundred fifty-six by two hundred fifty-six pixels. This collection covers twenty-six plant diseases and twelve healthy plants. The leaves are removed from the plant and placed on gray or black background, in various lighting conditions. All images are captured on a variety of gray backgrounds, except Corn Common Rust which has a black background. For the curated version, we exclude the irrelevant Background and Corn Common Rust classes from the original collection. Plant Village has a two-level label hierarchy, the supercategory is the crop type and the category is the disease type. We have preprocessed Plant Village for Meta Album by resizing a subset from the original dataset to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight image size.
