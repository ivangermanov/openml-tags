Isolet Dataset

Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

The Isolet dataset was generated as follows: subjects spoke the name of each letter of the alphabet twice. Hence, there are training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of speakers each, four groups can serve as training set, the last group as the test set. A total of examples are missing, the authors dropped them due to difficulties in recording. This is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task. It is also a very good domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms. For example, an algorithm on this domain is slower than backpropagation!

Description
Isolet (Isolated Letter Speech Recognition) dataset is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task. It is also a very good domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms.

Attributes Information
All attributes are continuous, real-valued attributes scaled into the range from negative one point zero to one point zero. The features are described in the paper by the creators cited below. The features include spectral coefficients, contour features, sonorant features, pre-sonorant features, and post-sonorant features.
