The QSAR-TID-100942 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100942. This dataset has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains information about a single protein, Cathepsin L one, also known as Cathepsin L, Cathepsin L one heavy chain, Cathepsin L light chain, and others. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus and is classified as an enzyme, protease, cysteine protease, cysteine protease CA clan, and cysteine protease C one A family.

Cathepsin L one is described as being involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, apoptotic process, immune response, cell communication, spermatogenesis, male gonad development, cellular response to starvation, response to glucose, negative regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, positive regulation of peptidase activity, response to organic cyclic compound, nerve development, protein catabolic process, collagen catabolic process, hair follicle morphogenesis, zymogen activation, enkephalin processing, response to gonadotropin, CD four-positive, alpha-beta T cell lineage commitment, keratinocyte proliferation, decidualization, antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen, autophagic cell death, response to glucocorticoid, proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process, Sertoli cell differentiation, elastin catabolic process, epithelial tube branching involved in lung morphogenesis, and positive regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway.
