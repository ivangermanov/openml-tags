**Child Bayesian Network**

The Child Bayesian Network is a sample network that showcases the capabilities of Bayesian networks in modeling complex relationships between variables. This network has twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with two hundred thirty parameters, making it a moderately sized network.

The average Markov blanket size for this network is three, indicating that each node has approximately three neighboring nodes that directly affect its probability distribution. The average degree of the nodes is two point five, which suggests that most nodes have two or three edges connecting them to other nodes.

This network models various aspects of a child's health, including their age, medical history, and physical examination results. It also incorporates factors related to lung function, oxygen levels, and cardiac health.

The network's structure reflects the conditional dependencies between these variables, allowing for probabilistic inference and prediction. By analyzing the network, experts can gain insights into how different factors contribute to a child's overall health and well-being.
