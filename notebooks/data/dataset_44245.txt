**Meta Album Cars Dataset (Micro)**

The original Cars dataset was collected in the year two thousand thirteen, and it contains more than sixteen thousand images from one hundred ninety-six classes of cars. Most images are on the road, but some have different backgrounds, and each image has only one car. Each class can have a variable number of images of variable resolutions. The preprocess version for this dataset was obtained by creating square images either duplicating the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right most three columns based on the orientation of the original image. In this case, cropping was not applied to create the square images since following this technique results in losing too much information from the cars. Then, the square images were resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
