The Meta-Album Cars Dataset (Micro)

The original Cars dataset was collected in the year two thousand thirteen and it contains more than sixteen thousand images from one hundred ninety-six classes of cars. Most images are on the road, but some have different backgrounds, and each image has only one car. Each class can have forty-eight to one thirty-six images of variable resolutions.
