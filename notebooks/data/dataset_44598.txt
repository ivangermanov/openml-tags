Name: QSAR Biodeg Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the QSAR Biodeg dataset with seed equal to zero

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using uniform random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples the columns if required, selecting a specified number of columns from the original dataset. If the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is maintained.

The function returns a new dataset with the selected data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
