Dataset Title: AutoUniv Dataset data problem: AutoUniv

Abstract: AutoUniv is an advanced data generator for classification tasks. The aim is to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. Data can be generated in CSV, ARFF or C formats.

Source: AutoUniv was developed by a researcher. AutoUniv website: http://sites.google.com/site/autouniv/.

Data Set Information: The user first creates a classification model and then generates classified examples from it. To create a model, the following are specified: the number of attributes (up to one thousand) and their type (discrete or continuous), the number of classes (up to ten), the complexity of the underlying rules and the noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have up to three thousand rules. Rare class models can be designed. A sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. AutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples; a user friendly statement of the classification rules in an 'if ... then' format; a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate.

Attribute Information: Attributes may be discrete with up to ten values or continuous. A discrete attribute can be nominal with values v, v, v ... or integer with values , , , ... .

Relevant Papers: Several papers have been published discussing the modeling of example life cycle in online classification learners, the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift, and the structure and majority classes in decision tree learning using AutoUniv.
