This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Glucocorticoid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and multiple FCFP molecular fingerprints.
