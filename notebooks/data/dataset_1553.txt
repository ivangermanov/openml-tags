AutoUniv is an advanced data generator for classification tasks, aiming to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. Data can be generated in various formats, including comma-separated values, Attribute Relation File Format, and C4.5.

The user initially creates a classification model and then generates classified examples from it. To create a model, the following specifications are required: the number of attributes and their type, either discrete or continuous; the number of classes; the complexity of the underlying rules; and the noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have multiple rules, and rare class models can be designed. A sequence of models can also be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift.

AutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples; a user-friendly statement of the classification rules in an if-then format; and a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate.

Attributes may be discrete with various values or continuous. A discrete attribute can be nominal with distinct values or integer with sequential values.

The relevance of this dataset lies in its ability to model the example life cycle in an online classification learner, as well as the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift. Additionally, the structure and majority classes in decision tree learning are also explored.
