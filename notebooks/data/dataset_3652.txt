This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred forty one five, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one twenty four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target single protein preferred name Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase D two, also known as nPKC-D two, PKD two, PRKD two, and synonyms.
