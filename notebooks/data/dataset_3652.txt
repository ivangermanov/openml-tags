QSAR-TID-100415 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100415. The dataset has 804 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and includes activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in serine/threonine-protein kinase D2 as a drug target.

Serine/threonine-protein kinase D2 is a single protein target that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group and PKD family. It is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, immune system process, and protein phosphorylation.

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, plasma membrane, and membrane. It has various functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and protein kinase C activity.
