This dataset, One Million Reddit Comments from Forty Subreddits, is tagged with Computer Systems and Machine Learning Content. It is an extract from a larger Reddit dataset containing both more comments and additional information such as timestamps, authors, and flairs. To facilitate ease of use, the first twenty-five thousand comments were selected from each of the forty most frequently visited subreddits, ensuring a balance in volume for those who wish to utilize the subreddit as categorical data.

The dataset excludes removed comments, comments from authors whose accounts have been deleted, and comments deemed too brief, having fewer than four tokens. The format has been converted from JSON to CSV. Primarily a natural language processing dataset, it includes the three most important features, offering a variety of feature types. The retained information consists of the subreddit where the comment was posted, the comment content itself, a measure of controversy based on a Reddit aggregated metric, and a score calculated by subtracting downvotes from upvotes.

Acknowledgments are due to Pushshift.io, which collects this type of data on a monthly basis. Those seeking to work with additional features and larger datasets may readily access the full information.

The diverse range of feature types enables users to gain insightful perspectives or construct simple models. Users are encouraged to explore and have fun!

Features included in this dataset are subreddit, body, controversy, and score.
