QSAR-TID-100942 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100942. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains ten rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The drug target, Cathepsin L1, is a single protein that belongs to the enzyme/protease/cysteine protease/cysteine protease CA clan/cysteine protease C1A family. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, immune response, and cell communication.

Cathepsin L1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and lung, and is involved in the degradation of collagen and other proteins. It is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers studying the structure-activity relationships of compounds on Cathepsin L1 and for the development of new inhibitors for this enzyme.
