Shuttle Seed One Number of Rows Two Thousand Number of Classes Ten Number of Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Shuttle with seed equal to one, number of rows equal to two thousand, number of columns equal to one hundred, number of classes equal to ten, and stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as parameters. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly and subsets it. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subsetted data and the corresponding categorical mask and columns.
