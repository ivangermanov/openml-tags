Diabetes Dataset 

The Diabetes dataset consists of ten baseline variables, including age, gender, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, which were obtained for each patient, along with the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Data Set Characteristics**

This dataset contains a total number of instances and a number of attributes. The first ten columns consist of numeric predictive values, while the eleventh column represents the target, which is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Attribute Information**

The attributes include age, gender, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, namely Serum One, Serum Two, Serum Three, Serum Four, Serum Five, and Serum Six. It is worth noting that each of these ten feature variables has been mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation.
