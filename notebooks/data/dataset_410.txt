Name: Carbolenes
Tags: Drug Design, Molecular Descriptors, Structure-Activity Relationships

This dataset is part of a collection of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are generated using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target variable.

The Carbolenes dataset is derived from a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. Other datasets in the collection include melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for polyaromatic hydrocarbons, platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors, and various toxicity and biodegradability models.

These datasets cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, including molecular descriptors influencing melting points, ligand binding to receptors, toxicity of halogenated compounds, biodegradability of chlorinated and brominated compounds, and stability of purposely modified proteins.

The datasets are valuable resources for developing and validating computational models in drug design, toxicology, and environmental science. They provide opportunities for researchers to explore structure-activity relationships, predict physicochemical properties, and understand molecular mechanisms underlying biological activities.

Features include various molecular descriptors generated by the Adriana.Code software, which capture different aspects of molecular structure and properties relevant to drug design and chemical informatics.
