Bank Thirty-Two NH

This dataset is part of a family of datasets synthetically generated from a simulation of how bank customers choose their banks. The primary task is to predict the fraction of bank customers who leave the bank due to full queues. This dataset was created using a simplistic simulator, specifically designed to generate a family of datasets for a particular purpose. This simulator models the queues in a series of banks, taking into account various factors such as customer behavior, bank location, and task complexity.

Customers in this simulation come from multiple residential areas and select their preferred bank based on distance and other factors. They have tasks of varying complexity and different levels of patience. Each bank has multiple queues that open and close according to demand, and the tellers have varying levels of effectiveness. If a customer's patience expires, they may switch queues.

In the rejection protocol tasks, the goal is to predict the rate of rejections, i.e., the fraction of customers who are turned away from the bank because all open tellers have full queues. This dataset is part of a larger collection of regression datasets and is originally sourced from the DELVE repository of data.

Characteristics of this dataset include a large number of cases and numerous continuous attributes. These attributes include information about the banks and their locations, customer characteristics, and queue dynamics.
