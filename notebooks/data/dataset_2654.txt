This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EurHkd pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during those days. The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam.

The class attribute signifies the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask prices of the subsequent day, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is expected to rise the following day, and false when the mean High price is anticipated to decline or remain stagnant the following day.
