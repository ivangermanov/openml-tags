Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of columns using a uniform random choice. It then subsets the data accordingly. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses a stratified train test split to select a subset of the data. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subsetted data and the corresponding categorical mask and columns.
