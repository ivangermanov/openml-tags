This dataset is a subsampling of the original Sylvine dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset. It also ensures that the resulting dataset has a maximum number of rows, columns, and classes.

The subsampling process starts by selecting a fixed number of classes from the original dataset using a random number generator. This is done to ensure that the resulting dataset has a good representation of all classes. Then, the columns are uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

If the number of rows in the resulting dataset exceeds a certain threshold, stratified sampling is applied to reduce the number of rows while maintaining the class balance. This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using a stratified approach.

Finally, the categorical columns are converted to strings to conform to OpenML standards. The resulting dataset is then returned with its features, target variable, and categorical mask.
