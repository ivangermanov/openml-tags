QSAR-TID-12641 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12641. The dataset has thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor. This receptor is a single protein, also known as Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor, GRP-preferring Bombesin Receptor, and Grpr. It belongs to the species Rattus norvegicus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, learning or memory, and regulation of cell population proliferation. It is also involved in response to external biotic stimulus, motor behavior, and positive regulation of respiratory gaseous exchange.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
