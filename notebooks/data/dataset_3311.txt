QSAR-TID-100127 Dataset: A Comprehensive Collection of QSAR Data for Drug Target TID 100127

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 100127. It consists of one hundred one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers studying the structure-activity relationships of compounds targeting TID 100127, enabling them to develop predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.

TID 100127, also known as Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FGR, is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Gardner-Rasheed Feline Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog, p55-Fgr, p58c-Fgr, and p58-Fgr. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TK protein kinase group/tyrosine protein kinase Src family.
