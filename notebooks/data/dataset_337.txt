SPECTF Tags: mythbusting, study

This dataset describes the diagnosis of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Patients are classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. The database consists of 267 SPECT image sets (patients) that were processed to extract features summarizing the original SPECT images. This resulted in a 44 continuous feature pattern for each patient. The CLIP3 algorithm was employed to generate classification rules from these patterns, achieving 77.0% accuracy compared to cardiologists' diagnoses.

SPECTF is an excellent dataset for testing machine learning algorithms, containing 267 instances described by 45 attributes. The predicted attribute is OVERALL DIAGNOSIS, which is binary. It's worth noting that the SPECT heart data provides binary data for the same classification task.

The dataset does not contain any missing values. The attributes include the class attribute (OVERALL DIAGNOSIS) and 44 continuous attributes representing counts in various regions of interest (ROI) during rest and stress conditions. All continuous attributes have integer values ranging from 0 to 100.

The dataset is divided into training data (80 instances) and testing data (187 instances). This merged version combines the separate train and test sets that are usually distributed. On OpenML, this train test split can be found as one of the possible tasks.

The SPECTF heart data provides valuable insights into cardiac imaging and diagnosis, offering researchers and machine learning practitioners a robust dataset for developing and testing classification algorithms in the medical domain.
