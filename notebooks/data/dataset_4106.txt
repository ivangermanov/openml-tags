The QSAR-TID-17113 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17113. This dataset has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent extended connectivity fingerprints of six atoms (FCFP6) 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically the study number three, and it falls under the categories of machine learning, QSAR, social media, statistics, and molecular targets. 

The preferred name for this protein target is Vitamin D Receptor, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group I Member One, VDR, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species Bos Taurus, and its classification is Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily One/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily One Group I/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily One Group I Member One.

This protein target is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, cell differentiation, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, and vitamin D receptor signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, Vitamin D Receptor, transcription factor, nuclear receptor, biological processes.
