QSAR-TID-17113 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17113. The dataset has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17113. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Vitamin D receptor, which is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression.

The Vitamin D receptor is a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including transcription, cell differentiation, and vitamin D response. It is a transcription factor that binds to specific DNA sequences and regulates the expression of target genes.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It can be used to develop predictive models that can identify potential compounds that interact with the Vitamin D receptor, which can lead to the development of new therapeutic agents.
