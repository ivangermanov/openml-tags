House Sixteen H Seed Four Dataset

This dataset is a subsampled version of the House Sixteen H dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The dataset has been tagged with Economics and Government categories, indicating its relevance to these fields. The subsampling process aimed to preserve the most important features of the original dataset while reducing its size to facilitate faster processing and analysis.

The subsampling algorithm employed a stratified approach to ensure that the sampled data retained the original distribution of classes. This involved selecting a fixed number of classes based on their frequency in the original dataset and then sampling rows and columns accordingly.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of features, including those related to Property and Household characteristics. These features have been carefully selected to represent the most important aspects of the original dataset.
