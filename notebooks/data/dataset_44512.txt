APS Failure Seed Four Dataset

This dataset is a subsampled version of the APS Failure dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The dataset has been stratified according to the target variable, ensuring that the class distribution remains consistent throughout the sampling process. This approach helps maintain the integrity of the dataset and prevents any particular class from dominating the others.

The feature selection process involved selecting a specified number of columns, which were chosen randomly from the original dataset. The selected columns were then used to create the subsampled dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of a specified number of rows and columns, with each column representing a feature and each row corresponding to a single instance or example. The target variable has been included in the dataset, along with the categorical mask, which indicates the categorical nature of certain features.
