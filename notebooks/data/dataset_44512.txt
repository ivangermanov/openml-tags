APS Failure Seed Four Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the APS Failure dataset, generated with a seed of four. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset with a maximum of two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns. The stratified sampling method was used to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The dataset features a selection of variables, including acceleration, angular velocity, and other sensor readings. These features were chosen to represent a diverse range of characteristics in the data.

The subsampling process was performed using a random number generator with a seed of four. This ensures that the resulting dataset is reproducible and can be used for benchmarking and comparison purposes.

The dataset is suitable for machine learning and data analysis tasks, particularly those involving classification and regression problems.
