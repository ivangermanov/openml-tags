Dataset Description Story:

To enhance my portfolio as a Data Science student, I aimed to create a web application capable of predicting airline flight prices based on user-selected origin and destination cities. In pursuit of this goal, I obtained a comprehensive dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, comprising over twenty-seven million rows and forty-two columns, covering quarters one through four of 2018.

After refining the dataset for consistency and eliminating unnecessary columns, I was left with approximately nine million rows and thirteen columns, which better suited my pricing prediction objectives.

Column Descriptions:

The dataset contains thirteen columns, excluding the unnamed column, which is a duplicate index column and can be disregarded. The remaining columns include:

* Itinerary Identification and Market Identification, which roughly demonstrate the sequence in which tickets were ordered;
* Market Coupons, representing the number of available coupons for a given flight;
* Quarter, indicating the quarter of 2018 during which the flight took place;
* Origin City, specifying the departure city;
* Origin World Area Code, denoting the US state or territory where the flight originated;
* Destination City, specifying the arrival city;
* Destination World Area Code, denoting the US state or territory where the flight concluded;
* Miles Traveled, indicating the distance covered during the flight;
* Contiguous United States, a binary column signifying whether the flight remained within the forty-eight contiguous states or not; 
* Number of Tickets Ordered, representing the quantity of tickets purchased; 
* Airline Company, specifying the two-letter airline company code utilized throughout the journey;
* Price Per Ticket, serving as the target prediction column.

Airline Company Codes, listed in order of frequency, consist of:
Southwest Airlines Co., Delta Air Lines Inc., American Airlines Inc., United Air Lines Inc., JetBlue Airways, Alaska Airlines Inc., Spirit Air Lines, Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines Inc., Hawaiian Airlines Inc., Sun Country Airlines, and Virgin America.

US State/Territory World Area Codes encompass various regions, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, US Pacific Trust Territories and Possessions, as well as numerous states across the country.
