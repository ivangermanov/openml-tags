QSAR-TID-10527 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10527. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it includes a large number of features that describe the molecular properties of these compounds.

The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are a type of feature that is commonly used in QSAR modeling. They are generated from the SMILES strings of the compounds, which are a way of representing the molecular structure of a compound as a string of characters. The fingerprints are then used as input features for a machine learning model, which predicts the activity of the compounds on the drug target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It provides a large and diverse set of compounds with activity data, which can be used to train and test machine learning models. The dataset is also part of a larger collection of QSAR data, which can be used to explore the relationships between molecular structure and activity across different drug targets.
