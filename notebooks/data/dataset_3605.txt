Cosmetics Datasets 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Whenever I want to try a new cosmetic item, it is extremely difficult to choose. In fact, it is often intimidating because new items that I have never tried before frequently end up causing me skin problems. We all know that the information we need is readily available on the back of each product, but it is genuinely challenging to decipher those complicated ingredient lists unless one has a strong background in chemistry. Many individuals may be able to relate to this frustrating situation.

We are going to develop a content-based recommendation system where the core content will revolve around the chemical components of cosmetics. Specifically, we will meticulously process ingredient lists for various cosmetics available on Sephora via word embedding, and subsequently visualize the striking similarities between ingredients utilizing a cutting-edge machine learning technique known as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and an innovative interactive visualization library referred to as Bokeh. To initiate this project, let us thoroughly examine our data.
