QSAR-TID-10207 Dataset: Images, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10207. The dataset has eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

MOLECULE CHEMBL ID is an identifier for each molecule.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

Please cite this dataset when using it.
