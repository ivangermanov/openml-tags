Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The function also ensures that the sampling is stratified, meaning that the proportion of each class in the original dataset is maintained in the new dataset.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset. Next, it selects a specified number of columns from the subsetted dataset using random sampling. Finally, it selects a specified number of rows from the subsetted dataset using stratified sampling.

The resulting dataset is returned with the specified number of rows, columns, and classes.
