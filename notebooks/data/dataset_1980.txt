This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Prostanoid EP One Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID 

The dataset contains information about the Prostanoid EP One Receptor, also known as PGE Two Receptor EP One Subtype, PGE Receptor EP One Subtype, Prostaglandin E Two Receptor EP One Subtype, and Prostanoid EP One Receptor Ptger One.
