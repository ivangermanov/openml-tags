The dataset named AP Prostate Kidney includes gene expression data that can be used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. The data is sourced from the expO (Expression Project For Oncology) repository by International Genomics Consortium, which provides clinically annotated tumor samples for research purposes. The repository was created to address the need for standardized gene expression datasets in the bioinformatics and machine learning communities. The gene expression samples in the dataset are processed consistently and analyzed using the same microarray platform. Researchers are encouraged to acknowledge the use of the dataset in their publications to facilitate reproducibility of experiments. The dataset features a large number of genes, including 1007_s_at, 121_at, 1405_i_at, and many more. By citing the dataset properly, researchers can contribute to the advancement of gene expression analysis techniques. Keywords: gene expression, machine learning, bioinformatics, expO repository, benchmarking, microarray platform, standardized samples, reproducibility.
