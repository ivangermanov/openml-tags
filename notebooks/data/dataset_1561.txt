Data Set Information:
This dataset consists of e-mails collected from the DBWorld newsletter. These e-mails were used to train various algorithms for the purpose of classifying messages into two categories: "announces of conferences" and "everything else". The data representation utilized a binary bag-of-words approach, with stopword removal performed as a pre-processing step.

Attribute Information:
Each attribute in the dataset corresponds to a specific word or stem found in the entire vocabulary of the data set. The representation method employed is the bag-of-words model.

Features:
The dataset includes numerous features, each representing a distinct word or stem from the corpus vocabulary. These features are labeled as V followed by a number, ranging from V to V and beyond, totaling over three thousand features.
