Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that has been subsampled. It uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset. Next, it uniformly samples columns from the dataset, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. Finally, it stratifies the dataset according to the target variable and returns the subsampled dataset.
