QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Dual specificity mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK), also known as MAPK/ERK kinase or MAP kinase kinase. This protein is classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE family. It is found in Homo sapiens and is involved in various cellular processes.

The protein has multiple Gene Ontology annotations, including:

Components: nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, membrane

Functions: nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein kinase binding, protein serine kinase activity

Processes: MAPK cascade, regulation of cytokine production, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, response to ischemia, protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response, signal transduction, heart development, phosphorylation, stress activated protein kinase signaling cascade, negative regulation of hippo signaling, cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus, pMAPK cascade, positive regulation of MAPK cascade, positive regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell migration, positive regulation of protein kinase activity, positive regulation of DNA templated transcription, positive regulation of nitric oxide synthase biosynthetic process, cardiac muscle contraction, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cellular response to sorbitol, cellular senescence

The protein is referenced in various databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, and Reactome.
