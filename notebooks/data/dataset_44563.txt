Philippine Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

Sub sampling of the Philippine dataset with a total of forty-one thousand one hundred forty-five entries, using a seed of zero, maximum number of rows of two thousand, maximum number of columns of one hundred, maximum number of classes of ten, and stratification set to true.

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset based on various parameters. It first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. Then, it selects a uniform sample of classes from the dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, selecting a specified number of columns randomly without replacement. It then filters the dataset based on the selected columns.

If the resulting dataset has more than the maximum allowed number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a specified number of rows, ensuring that the class distribution remains the same. Finally, it returns a new dataset object with the subsampled data.

Features: The dataset contains a variety of features, including variables one, two, three, four, six, eight, nine, fifteen, seventeen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-six, thirty-two, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty-three, fifty-eight, sixty-four, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-nine, seventy-four, seventy-five, eighty, eighty-seven, ninety-two, ninety-four, ninety-nine, one hundred, one hundred one, and so on.
