The QSAR-TID-101048 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101048. This dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

The features do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. However, some features may be difficult to read due to their technical nature.

This dataset is related to the single protein preferred name Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase ULK three, also known as Unc Fifty-One-Like Kinase three. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme kinase protein kinase other protein kinase group other protein kinase ULK family.

According to the description, Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase ULK three is involved in various biological processes, including autophagosome assembly, autophagy of mitochondrion, protein phosphorylation, and response to starvation. It is also associated with cellular components such as phagophore assembly site, cytoplasm, autophagosome, cytosol, phagophore assembly site membrane, and ciliary tip.
