ASP POTASCO Classification Dataset

This dataset was generated for a publication about ClaspFolio 2.0, an algorithm selector for Answer Set Programming (ASP). The algorithm portfolio of Clasp configuration is generated by the Hydra method in combination with Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC).

To generate the features, I utilized Claspre, a lightweight version of the ASP solver Clasp, with both static and dynamic features, including four restarts each after thirty-two conflicts.

The dataset includes various features, such as instance identification, repetition, fraction of negative body rules, fraction of positive body rules, fraction of unary rules, fraction of binary rules, fraction of ternary rules, fraction of integrity rules, tightness, problem variables, free problem variables, assigned problem variables, constraints, constraint variables, created bodies, program atoms, strongly connected component sets, nodes in positive binary attributed graphs, rules, normal rules, cardinality rules, choice rules, weight rules, and equivalences.
