**Insurance Bayesian Network. Sample Seven**

This Bayesian network repository reference is available online. The Insurance Bayesian Network consists of twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point nineteen, while the average degree is around three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Insurance Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model that takes into account various factors influencing insurance policies. It incorporates demographic information, such as age, socioeconomic status, and home base, as well as details about the vehicle, including its make, model, year, mileage, and features like anti-lock brakes, airbags, and anti-theft devices. Additionally, the network considers the driver's history, skill level, risk aversion, and quality, along with the cost of repairs, medical expenses, and property damage.

This Bayesian network has been widely cited in research papers, including Adaptive Probabilistic Networks with Hidden Variables, published in Machine Learning journal.
