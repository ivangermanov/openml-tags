**Hailfinder Bayesian Network**

The Hailfinder Bayesian network is a discrete large network repository referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. This network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, resulting in two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, while the average degree is two point three six, with a maximum in-degree of four.

This Bayesian system was designed for forecasting severe weather conditions, specifically focusing on hail storms. It integrates various features, including cloud characteristics, atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and moisture levels, to predict the likelihood of hail.

Some of the notable features incorporated into this model include Capabilities in Scenarios, Mid-Level Lapse Rate, Wind Aloft, Low-Level Lapse Rate, Scene Relative Atmospheric Moisture Content Index, Combined Moisture, Mean Relative Humidity, Synthetic Forcing, Atmospheric Instability Mount, Scene Relative Atmospheric Instability, Morning Cloudiness Index, Subjective Vertical Motion, Quasi-Geostrophic Vertical Motion, Outflow from Mountains, Combined Clouds, Satellite Continuity Moisture, Area of Moist Dry Air, Atmospheric Instability Wind Liability Scenario, Infrared Cloud Cover, Cloud Shade Convection, Lifted Index Friction Density, Scene Relative Precipitation Forecast, Current Propagation Convection, and others.
