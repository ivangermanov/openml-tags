The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from a specific source. These datasets are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for generating data. It includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function comprises five features for input.

To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity.

Colinearity refers to the number of features dependent on other features. The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies, including five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples also varies, including one hundred, two hundred fifty, five hundred, and one thousand.

There are five different colinearity degrees: zero, one, two, three, and four. 

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features generated are ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
