QSAR-TID-10216 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10216, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset provides information about Protein Kinase C Zeta, also known as PRKCZ, which is an enzyme that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group. It is involved in various cellular processes, including stress fiber formation, nucleus organization, and cytosol signaling.

The dataset includes features such as molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the structural properties of molecules. These features are essential for understanding the interactions between molecules and their biological targets.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. It is an essential tool for researchers and scientists working in the field of computer-aided drug design and discovery.
