The QSAR-TID-100098 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100098. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features, such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. It is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target is a serine/threonine-protein kinase, specifically the WEE1 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression.

The dataset also includes information about the compounds, including their ChEMBL IDs, parent molecule names, parent molecule types, mechanisms of action, max phases, and first approval dates. Additionally, it provides links to external resources, such as PubMed, ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, and GoProcess.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in targeting the WEE1 enzyme for cancer therapy.
