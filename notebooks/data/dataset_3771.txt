QSAR-TID-100098 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100098. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has several compounds with activity values on the drug target Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase WEE1, which is a single protein preferred name. It is also known as Wee1A kinase, Wee1-like protein kinase, and Wee1hu. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle, cell division, and protein phosphorylation.

The dataset contains features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, which is a unique identifier for each compound. The other features are FCFP6_1024, which are molecular fingerprints generated from the SMILES strings of the compounds.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project involves the collection and curation of QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase WEE1. It provides a large collection of compounds with activity values, which can be used to train and validate QSAR models.
