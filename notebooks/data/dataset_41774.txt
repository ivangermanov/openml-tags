**Data Description**

This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex Euro Hungarian Forint (EUR/HUF) sourced from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a one-minute candlestick, with the entire dataset spanning from January first to December thirteenth. As the Forex market is inactive during weekends, the dataset excludes these periods. The timestamp feature adheres to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the directional movement of the mean high bid and ask prices between consecutive minutes. Specifically, it indicates whether the mean high price is increasing or decreasing (or remains stagnant) in the subsequent minute. A true classification signifies an upward trend, while a false classification implies a downward or stagnant trend.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trade strategies should be based on predictions involving 'close' attributes, which are also available.**
