QSAR-TID-100993 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type Two, and it has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type Two. Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type Two is a single protein preferred name, also known as BMPR Two, BMPR-Two, BMP Type-Two Receptor, and BMP Type Two Receptor. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TKL protein kinase group, TKL protein kinase STKR family, and TKL protein kinase STKR Type Two subfamily.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type Two.
