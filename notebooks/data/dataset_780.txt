Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This process of binarization allows for a simplified analysis of the data, reducing complex numerical values to a binary classification system. Such transformation can be particularly useful in certain types of statistical analyses and machine learning applications where a clear distinction between two categories is required.

The dataset, while anonymized in terms of its origin and authorship, provides a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems. The transformation from a continuous numerical target to a binary outcome enables the application of various classification algorithms and statistical methods tailored for dichotomous data analysis. This binarized version of the dataset offers opportunities for comparative studies, hypothesis testing, and the development of predictive models based on binary outcomes.
