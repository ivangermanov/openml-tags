The dataset, named Case Whale, is tagged under Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and other relevant categories. This binarized version of the original dataset takes the numeric target feature and converts it into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean is computed, and all instances with a lower target value are classified as Positive, denoted by 'P', while the rest are classified as Negative, denoted by 'N'. The dataset comprises various features, including Column One, Column Two, Column Three, Column Four, Column Six, Column Seven, Column Eight, Column Nine, and Column Ten, ultimately leading to a Binary Class.
