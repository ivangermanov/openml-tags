This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean, then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

The dataset consists of various chemical compounds, each described by several features, including Oz One, Oz Two, Oz Three, and so on up to Oz Twenty-Five, along with their corresponding binary class labels.
