The binarized version of the original data set has been modified to convert the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

The resulting data set includes various features that provide insight into different aspects of cities. These features include the city itself, its population, per capita income, household income, discretionary income, and the presence of public institutions, non-profit organizations, for-profit organizations, and utilities in the top ten lists. Additionally, the region and state capital status of each city are also included.
