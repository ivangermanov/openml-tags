This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10014, is tagged with Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Statistics, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dated September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10014. There are 979 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule Chembl ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The features include Molecule Chembl ID, and numerous FCFP6 1024-bit molecular fingerprints.

The dataset pertains to the platelet-activating factor receptor, also known as PAFr or PAF-R, which is a single protein found in the plasma membrane and membrane of organisms such as Cavia porcellus. The protein target classification is 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor.

This receptor has various functions, including lipopolysaccharide binding, lipopolysaccharide immune receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, platelet activating factor receptor activity, and phospholipid binding. It is involved in multiple biological processes, such as chemotaxis, inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, response to lipopolysaccharide, inositol trisphosphate biosynthetic process, and phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, platelet-activating factor receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, lipopolysaccharide binding, inflammatory response, signal transduction.
