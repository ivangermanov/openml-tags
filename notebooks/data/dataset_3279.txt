QSAR-TID-100044 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Mu Opioid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mu Opioid Receptor. The Mu Opioid Receptor is a single protein, also known as M-OR-one, MOR-one, Mu-type Opioid Receptor, and OPRM one. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor family, and short peptide receptor family.

The Mu Opioid Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, sensory perception of pain, and G protein-coupled opioid receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of cAMP-mediated signaling, nitric oxide biosynthetic process, neurogenesis, cytosolic calcium ion concentration, Wnt protein secretion, ERK one and ERK two cascade, and NMDA receptor activity.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
