QSAR-TID-100044 Dataset 

Tags: Images, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand forty-four, and it consists of one thousand five hundred forty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mu opioid receptor, also known as M-OR-one, MOR-one, Mu-type opioid receptor, and OPRM one. It belongs to the species group Cavia porcellus and is classified under membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The dataset is related to opioid receptor mu and kappa, mu/kappa opioid receptor, and is part of the protein family. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, sensory perception of pain, and G protein-coupled opioid receptor signaling pathway.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and many others...
