QSAR-TID-102667 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102667. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
