Bias Correction of Numerical Prediction Model Temperature Forecast Dataset

This dataset is designed for the purpose of bias correction of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures forecast of the Local Data Assimilation Prediction System model operated by the Korean Meteorological Administration over Seoul, South Korea.

The dataset consists of summer data from twenty thirteen to twenty seventeen. The input data is largely composed of the Local Data Assimilation Prediction System model's next-day forecast data, in-situ maximum and minimum temperatures of present-day, and geographic auxiliary variables.

There are two outputs in this dataset, namely next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures. Hindcast validation was conducted for the period from twenty fifteen to twenty seventeen.

Attribute information includes:

Station, which refers to the used weather station number
Date, which represents the present day in the format year-month-day
Present Maximum Air Temperature, which is the maximum air temperature between zero and twenty one hours on the present day in degrees Celsius
Present Minimum Air Temperature, which is the minimum air temperature between zero and twenty one hours on the present day in degrees Celsius
Local Data Assimilation Prediction System Model Forecast of Next-Day Minimum Relative Humidity, which is the percentage of next-day minimum relative humidity
Local Data Assimilation Prediction System Model Forecast of Next-Day Maximum Relative Humidity, which is the percentage of next-day maximum relative humidity
