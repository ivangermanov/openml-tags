QSAR-TID-100624 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100624. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Proteasome Macropain subunit MB1, which is a single protein target. The Proteasome Macropain subunit MB1 is also known by several synonyms, including LMPX, Macropain epsilon chain MB1, and Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex epsilon chain.

The dataset is related to the organism Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, threonine protease, and threonine protease PBT clan. The dataset provides information on the expression of the Proteasome Macropain subunit MB1, including its relationship with other proteins and its role in various biological processes.

The dataset is also linked to several other datasets, including the ChEMBL database, which provides information on bioactive molecules and their targets. The dataset is also connected to the ExpressionAtlas, which provides information on gene expression across different tissues and conditions.
