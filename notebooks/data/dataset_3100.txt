QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Nociceptin receptor, also known as K opiate receptor, Kappa type opioid receptor, KOR, and Oor. This receptor is a single protein target found in Mus musculus. It belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the peptide receptor and short peptide receptor subgroups within the opioid receptor classification.

The Nociceptin receptor is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, neuropeptide signaling, behavior regulation, sensory perception of pain, and regulation of urine volume. It also plays a role in eating behavior, blood pressure regulation, and calcium ion concentration modulation.

This receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic vesicles, and neuron projections. Its functions include nociceptin receptor activity, G protein coupled receptor activity, opioid receptor activity, and neuropeptide binding.

The dataset provides valuable information for studying the pharmacological properties and potential drug interactions of compounds targeting the Nociceptin receptor. It can be used for quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) modeling and drug discovery efforts focused on pain management, behavioral disorders, and other related conditions.
