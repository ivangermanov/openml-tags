QSAR-TID-10530 Dataset Information

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10530. It has ninety rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

Dataset Information

The dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
