The Iris Flower Dataset 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

The Iris Flower dataset has been widely used in statistical analysis and machine learning studies. This dataset was first introduced in a classic paper titled The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems and can also be found on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It comprises three iris species with an equal number of samples for each, along with certain characteristics about each flower. Interestingly, one flower species is distinctly separate from the other two based on its characteristics, whereas the remaining two cannot be separated from each other using these characteristics.

The dataset consists of several columns containing information about each flower. These columns contain details such as the unique identifier for each sample, sepal length in centimeters, sepal width in centimeters, petal length in centimeters, petal width in centimeters, and the type of iris species.

Features: unique identifier, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, type of iris species.
