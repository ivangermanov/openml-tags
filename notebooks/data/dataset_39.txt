Title: Protein Localization Sites

This dataset contains information on protein localization sites in E. coli bacteria. It was created and maintained by the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Osaka University in Japan. The data has been used for predicting the cellular localization sites of proteins using various machine learning methods, including probabilistic classification systems, binary decision trees, and Bayesian classifiers.

The dataset consists of instances for E. coli proteins, with each instance having several attributes. These attributes include methods for signal sequence recognition, scores for membrane spanning region prediction, and analyses of amino acid content. The class labels represent different localization sites within the bacterial cell, such as cytoplasm, inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane.

Previous research using this dataset and its predecessors has focused on developing expert systems for predicting protein localization in gram negative bacteria and eukaryotic cells. The accuracy of these prediction methods has been reported to be around for E. coli proteins.

The attributes in the dataset provide various scores and binary indicators related to protein structure and composition. These include McGeoch's method for signal sequence recognition, von Heijne's method for signal sequence recognition, and scores from discriminant analysis of amino acid content. Some attributes are specific to certain types of proteins, such as the presence of charge on the N terminus of predicted lipoproteins.

The class distribution shows that the majority of proteins in the dataset are localized in the cytoplasm, followed by the inner membrane without signal sequence, and the periplasm. There are also smaller numbers of proteins localized in other sites such as the outer membrane and various types of lipoproteins.

This dataset is valuable for researchers studying protein localization and developing computational methods for predicting where proteins will be found within bacterial cells. It has applications in fields such as molecular biology, bioinformatics, and protein engineering.
