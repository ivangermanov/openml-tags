Past Usage: 
Reference: A Probabilistic Classification System for Predicting the Cellular Localization Sites of Proteins 
Results: Eighty-one percent for E coli with an ad hoc structured probability model. Similar accuracy for binary decision tree and Bayesian classifier methods. 
Predicted Attribute: Localization site of protein (non-numeric). 

Number of Instances: For the E coli dataset 
Number of Attributes: For E coli dataset, there are eight attributes (seven predictive, one name).
