The OkCupid Stem dataset is a collection of user profile data for San Francisco OkCupid users, published in a research paper. The curated dataset was downloaded from a GitHub repository. The original dataset was created using a Python script that pulled data from public profiles on OkCupid.com on June thirtieth, two thousand twelve. It includes people within a twenty-five-mile radius of San Francisco, who were online in the last year, with at least one profile picture. Permission to use this data was obtained under the condition that the dataset remains public.

As the target, the variable "job" was collapsed into three categories: "STEM", "non-STEM", and "student". STEM jobs were defined as jobs related to computer hardware software, science tech engineering. Observations with jobs listed as "unemployed", "retired", or "rather not say" or missing values in "job" were removed.

The factor labels of the variable "speaks" had to be changed to integers to prevent a bug that would not allow the upload of the variable as a nominal feature. The original dataset also included ten open text variables, which were removed from the dataset uploaded here. The dataset further includes the date time variable "last online", which could be used to construct additional features.

Using OkCupid data for predicting STEM jobs was inspired by a book on feature engineering and selection for predictive models.

Features include age, height, body type, drinking habits, drug use, education, ethnicity, location, sexual orientation, sex, astrological sign, smoking habits, and relationship status.
