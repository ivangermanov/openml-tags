QSAR-TID-100845 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100845. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program. 

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, molecular fingerprints.

Description:
The target is a single protein known as Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase MRCK Alpha. It is also referred to as CDC42-Binding Protein Kinase Alpha, among other synonyms. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the AGC protein kinase group.

Expression Atlas:
The protein is expressed in various cellular components, including the cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, cell-cell junction, lamellipodium, and cell leading edge. It is also involved in multiple biological processes, such as protein phosphorylation, cytoskeleton organization, peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization.

Functional Annotations:
The protein has nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, protein kinase, protein serine/threonine kinase, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase, transferase, identical protein binding, and metal ion binding activities.

Reactome Pathways:
The protein participates in multiple reactome pathways, including the CDC42 GTPase cycle, RAC1 GTPase cycle, RHOQ GTPase cycle, and RHOJ GTPase cycle.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, protein kinase, cytoskeleton organization, protein phosphorylation, reactome pathways.
