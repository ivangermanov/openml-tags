This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. The dataset comprises various features, including ozone-related variables. The binary class feature categorizes instances into two distinct classes.
