Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers. These features are not easily human-readable and have been omitted for clarity. The final feature is binaryClass.

This dataset represents a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem. The transformation process involved calculating the mean value of the original numeric target and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with values below the mean were classified as positive, while those above or equal to the mean were classified as negative. This binarization allows for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques to the dataset.

The dataset's origin and original author are unknown, and the date of creation is not specified. It is important for researchers and data scientists using this dataset to properly cite it in their work, acknowledging its binarized nature and its derivation from an earlier version.
