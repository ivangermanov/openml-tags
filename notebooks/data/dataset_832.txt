The Anal Cat Data Broadway dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. This means that the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the majority class was relabeled as positive, denoted by 'Positive', while all other classes were relabeled as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

This conversion process was originally carried out by an individual. The resulting dataset includes various features that describe different aspects of Broadway shows. These features include information about the Show itself, its Type, whether it is a Revival, ratings from the New York Times and Daily News, the number of Tony Awards and nominations received, attendance during the first week, and the overall Show Run.
