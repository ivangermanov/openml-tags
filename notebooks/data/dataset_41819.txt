**Data Description:** 

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex EUR/RUB currency pair obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a one-minute candlestick, and the entire dataset spans a period from January to December. As the Forex market is closed on weekends, there is no data available for these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent minute relative to the mean high price of the current minute. In other words, if the mean high price is increasing in the next minute, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.

**Note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only, and realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of close attributes, which are also available.**
