Name: Eye Movements Seed Two N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset after performing uniform sampling on classes, columns, and rows.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the unique classes present in the dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes using their value counts as probabilities. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates the dataset accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns using random choice and updates the dataset.

Finally, the function samples rows if required. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, it performs stratified sampling using the target variable and updates the dataset.

The resulting dataset is then returned with the required features, which include line number, assignment number, previous fixation duration, first fixation duration, first pass fixation duration, next fixation duration, first saccade length, last saccade length, previous fixation position, landing position, leaving position, total fixation duration, mean fixation duration, regression length, regression duration, pupil diameter maximum, pupil diameter lag, time protection, title number, word number, and label.
