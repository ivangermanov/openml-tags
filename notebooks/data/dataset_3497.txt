This dataset, named QSAR-TID-115, is tagged with Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dated September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 115. There are 974 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes various molecular fingerprints, such as FCFP6 1024 0, FCFP6 1024 1, FCFP6 1024 2, and so on.

Scraped data reveals that the ID is CHEMBL227, and the type is Single Protein. The preferred name is Type-1 Angiotensin II Receptor, also known as AGTR1, AGTR1A, AGTR1B, Angiotensin II Type-1 Receptor, AT1AR, and others.

The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is classified as No Protein Target Classification: 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Short peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Angiotensin receptor.

Description and Relationship Accession Type-1 Angiotensin II Receptor Single Protein P30556.

ChEMBL ID, Relationship, Pref Name, Target Type, and other related information are also included.

Keywords: QSAR, Angiotensin II Receptor, Molecular Fingerprints, Drug Target, Bioinformatics, Pharmacology.
