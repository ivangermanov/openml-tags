QSAR-TID-115 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin II Receptor, and it has a large number of rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin II Receptor. The Type One Angiotensin II Receptor is a single protein and its preferred name is Type One Angiotensin II Receptor. It also has several synonyms including AGTR One, AGTR One A, AGTR One B, Angiotensin II Type One Receptor, AT One AR, and more.

The Type One Angiotensin II Receptor is a membrane receptor and it belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor family. It is a short peptide receptor and it is involved in the regulation of cell growth, kidney development, and maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis by renin-angiotensin.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and it was created in September two thousand fifteen. It contains a large number of compounds and their activity values on the Type One Angiotensin II Receptor.
