Generated with the following source code:

The function sub sample takes in parameters such as seed, number rows max, number columns max, number classes max, and stratified, and returns a dataset.

First, it sets up a random number generator using the given seed. Then it selects the input data x and output data y from the original dataset.

If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it uniformly samples the classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates x and y accordingly.

Next, if there are more columns than the maximum allowed, it uniformly samples the columns and updates x accordingly.

If there are more rows than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data based on the class distribution.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to strings and returns a new dataset with the sub sampled data.
