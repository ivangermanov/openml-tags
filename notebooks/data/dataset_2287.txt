The QSAR-TID-103037 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103037. It has thirty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited accordingly.

The scrap data includes information about the bombesin receptor subtype-three, which is a single protein preferred name with synonyms bombesin receptor subtype-three, Brs three, and BRS-three. It belongs to the species group Rattus norvegicus and is classified under one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The description relationship accession for this receptor is bombesin receptor subtype-three single protein. It has relationships with other proteins and is part of several pathways, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, and bombesin receptor signaling pathway.

This receptor also has functions such as G protein-coupled receptor activity, bombesin receptor activity, neuropeptide receptor activity, and G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity. It is located in the plasma membrane, membrane, and neuronal cell body.
