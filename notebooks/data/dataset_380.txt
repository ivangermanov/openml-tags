The SyskillWebert-Bands dataset is categorized under Computer Systems and Machine Learning, and is sourced from the University of California, Irvine.

This database contains the HTML source code of web pages along with their corresponding ratings given by a single user. The web pages are classified into four distinct subjects, which include Bands - recording artists, Goats, Sheep, and Bio Medical.

Each web page's HTML source code is provided, and users were asked to evaluate each web page using a three-point scale of hot, medium, or cold. This evaluation was done for fifty to one hundred pages per domain, which may seem limited, but it is intentionally designed to simulate real-world scenarios where users have an incentive to rate pages based on their interests.

The primary goal of this dataset is to predict user ratings for web pages within a specific subject category. The accuracy of predicting ratings has been reported in various publications, with some studies using metrics such as precision at top N or the F-measure.

The Syskill and Webert Web Page Ratings dataset has been previously utilized in research papers, focusing on learning and revising user profiles to identify interesting websites.

Features of this dataset include identifier, text, and class.

Scraped data provides additional information about the dataset, including the fact that it does not contain any missing values.
