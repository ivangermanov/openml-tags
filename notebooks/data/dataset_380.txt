This database contains the HTML source of web pages plus the ratings of a single user on these web pages. The web pages cover four separate subjects: Bands (recording artists), Goats, Sheep, and BioMedical. The HTML source of each web page is provided. Users examined each web page and indicated their preference on a three point scale (hot, medium, cold) for a substantial number of pages per domain. This approach is realistic because the goal is to learn user profiles from as few examples as possible, providing users with an incentive to rate pages. The primary challenge is to predict user ratings for web pages within a specific subject category. Early publications reported on the accuracy of predicting ratings, while later publications utilized metrics such as precision at top N or the F measure.

The dataset includes the HTML source of web pages along with user ratings. Users evaluated each page on a three point scale ranging from hot to cold, covering a significant number of pages across different domains. This approach aims to learn user preferences efficiently, encouraging user participation in the rating process. The main objective is to accurately predict how a user would rate web pages within a given subject area. Various performance metrics have been used to evaluate prediction accuracy in different studies.

Features include identification, text content, and classification. The dataset provides comprehensive information about web pages and corresponding user ratings, enabling researchers to develop and refine algorithms for personalized content recommendation and user profiling. This resource offers valuable insights into user preferences and browsing behavior, contributing to advancements in web personalization and information retrieval systems.
