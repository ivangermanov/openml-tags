QSAR-TID-101252 Tags: Mathematics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101252, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many other FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints including FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four one, and so on.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

The dataset is related to the Prostanoid FP receptor, also known as the PGF two alpha receptor, PGF receptor, Prostaglandin F two alpha receptor, and Ptgfr. The receptor is found in the species Mus musculus.

The receptor is classified as a single protein, specifically a membrane receptor, Family A G protein coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and Lipid like ligand receptor. Its description is related to the inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway.
