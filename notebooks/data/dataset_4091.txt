The RL dataset belongs to the classification on categorical and numerical features benchmark. The goal of this challenge is to expose the research community to real-world datasets of interest, formatted in a uniform way, although the type of data may differ. The data are provided as preprocessed matrices, so that participants can focus on classification, although they are welcome to use additional feature extraction procedures, as long as they do not violate any rules of the challenge.

All problems are binary classification problems and are assessed with the normalized Area Under the ROC Curve metric. The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, although its structure is revealed. The final score will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets, a ranking will be generated from such results, and winners will be determined according to such ranking.

The tasks are constrained by a time budget, and the computational resources are shared by all participants. Each code submission will be executed in a compute worker with specific characteristics, including two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, forty gigabytes of solid-state drive storage, and an Ubuntu operating system. To ensure the fairness of the evaluation, when a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited.

Features include various categorizations and numerical values.

Keywords: classification, categorical features, numerical features, binary classification, area under roc curve, preprocessing, feature extraction, time budget, computational resources.
