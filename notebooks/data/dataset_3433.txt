The QSAR-TID-12824 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12824. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains multiple features, including molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint features, and median PXc50.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The dataset is related to the single protein preferred name Cholecystokinin A receptor, which has multiple synonyms, including CCK one R, Cckar, CCK AR, CCK A receptor, and Cholecystokinin one receptor. This receptor is classified under membrane receptor, family A G protein coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The dataset also provides information about the organism, species group, and protein target classification. It includes description, relationships, accession, and target type.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes. It includes multiple gene ontology components, such as endosome, plasma membrane, membrane, and terminal bouton. It also includes multiple gene ontology functions, such as G protein coupled receptor activity, cholecystokinin receptor activity, peptide hormone binding, and peptide binding.

Furthermore, the dataset provides information about gene ontology processes, including temperature homeostasis, gastric acid secretion, neuron migration, reduction of food intake in response to dietary excess, signal transduction, and G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset also includes information about canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
