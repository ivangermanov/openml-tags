The Multiple Features Dataset: Pixel is one of a set of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. The maps were scanned in eight-bit grey value at a density of four hundred dots per inch, sharpened, and thresholded. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. Two hundred instances per class have been digitized in binary images. Using this dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained.

The dataset contains two hundred instances per class, for a total of two thousand instances. The attributes represent pixel averages in two by three windows. 

The dataset is used in various studies, including handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers and statistical pattern recognition.

The dataset contains the following attributes: class, and one hundred forty-one pixel averages.

Keywords: handwritten numerals, Dutch utility maps, pixel averages, binary images, digit recognition, pattern recognition.
