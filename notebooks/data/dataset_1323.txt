QSAR-TID-10227 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10227. 

The dataset has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset should be cited when used.
