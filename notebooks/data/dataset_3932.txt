**QSAR-TID-10187**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10187. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has sixty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

Features include molecule identifiers and molecular fingerprints.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The target protein is Caspase-2, also known as Casp-2 or Caspase-2 subunit p12/p13. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/protease/cysteine protease/cysteine protease CD clan/cysteine protease C14 family.

Caspase-2 is involved in various biological processes, including luteolysis, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, neural retina development, proteolysis, and apoptotic process.

It is also associated with several cellular components, including nucleus, nucleolus, cytoplasm, cytosol, caspase complex, protein-containing complex, and endopeptidase complex.

Keywords: QSAR, Caspase-2, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR, drug target, enzymatic activity, apoptosis, proteolysis.
