California Environmental Conditions Dataset
Tags: Context

Explore an environmental conditions dataframe scraped from California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) weather stations using a Selenium ChromeDriver. With California's wildfires setting records, it is worthwhile to explore factors that may contribute to creating at-risk environments. This dataset was used in conjunction with building an XGBoost Classifier to accurately predict the probability of fire given environmental condition features. Following the Fire Risk Analysis project.

The dataset contains 262 station IDs corresponding to California weather station IDs. It includes approximately 14 numerical features for exploratory data analysis. Advanced users can keep the date feature for time series analysis. The target column corresponds to fires on the respective observation date, in the observation region.

Inspiration: What additional features would be valuable in determining fire risk? What features are most important for specific models in determining the target? Is there an accurate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to determine feature predictions to determine fire risk in the future?
