Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the Regression on Numerical Features benchmark.

Original Description:

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset consists of various features including House-related variables. The classification of the target feature into Positive and Negative classes enables the analysis of the relationships between these features and their impact on the outcome.
