The INDUCE Trains Data set contains information about trains traveling east and west. It was originally created for research on inductive inference and conceptual clustering. The dataset includes attributes describing the cars and loads in each train.

The data is provided in both its original relational form and a transformed propositional format. The transformed version has one instance per line with attributes for the number of cars, number of different loads, and details about each car such as number of wheels, length, shape, number of loads, and load shape. There are also Boolean attributes indicating whether certain load types are on adjacent cars.

Additional background knowledge is supplied that provides a partial ordering on some attribute values. For example, certain car shapes are categorized as "open top" or "closed top".

The prediction task is to determine concise decision rules distinguishing eastbound from westbound trains. Previous research found rules based on attributes like car shapes, lengths, and load shapes. Clustering approaches identified cognitively appealing groupings based on car shape diversity and wheel color consistency.

The dataset contains ten instances, evenly split between eastbound and westbound trains. There are ten attributes in the original format, not including the class attribute. The transformed version has 33 attributes. The number of cars per train varies from three to five.

Attribute values include car shapes like open rectangle, closed rectangle, ellipse, engine, etc. Load shapes include triangle, rectangle, circle, and hexagon. Car lengths are short or long. The number of wheels per car is either two or three.

This dataset provides an interesting challenge for machine learning and data mining techniques due to its relational structure and background knowledge. It allows for exploring methods that can generate human interpretable rules and concepts from structured object descriptions.
