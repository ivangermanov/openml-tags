The Official World Golf Ranking Data

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics

Context:
The Official World Golf Ranking is a system designed to rate the performance level of male professional golfers. Established in nineteen eighty-six, the ranking system takes into account a player's position in individual tournaments over a rolling two-year period. New rankings are produced every week. The ranking system covers numerous tournaments on multiple tours, including the PGA Tour, European Tour, and Asian Tour, among others.

During the year twenty eighteen, nearly four hundred tournaments on twenty tours were covered by the ranking system. All players competing in these tournaments are included in the rankings. As of twenty nineteen, twenty-three tours factor into the world rankings. The World Ranking Points for each player are accumulated over a two-year rolling period, with the points awarded for each tournament maintained for a thirteen-week period to place additional emphasis on recent performances. 

Ranking points are then reduced in equal decrements for the remaining ninety-one weeks of the two-year ranking period. Each player is then ranked according to their average points per tournament, which is determined by dividing their total number of points by the tournaments they have played over that two-year period. 

There is a minimum divisor of forty tournaments over the two-year ranking period and a maximum divisor of a player's last fifty-two tournaments. Simply put, a golfer's World Ranking is obtained by dividing their points total by the number of events they have played, which gives their average. Players are then ranked; a higher average yields a higher rank.
