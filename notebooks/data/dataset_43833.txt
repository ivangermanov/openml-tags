Official World Golf Ranking Data

Tags: Official World Golf Ranking Data

Context: The Official World Golf Ranking is a system for rating the performance level of male professional golfers, which was started in 1986. The rankings are based on a player's position in individual tournaments, not pairs or team events, over a rolling two-year period. New rankings are produced each week, covering nearly four hundred tournaments on twenty tours. All players competing in these tournaments are included in the rankings.

The World Ranking Points for each player are accumulated over a two-year rolling period, with the points awarded for each tournament maintained for a thirteen-week period to place additional emphasis on recent performances. Ranking points are then reduced in equal decrements for the remaining ninety-one weeks of the two-year ranking period. Each player is then ranked according to his average points per tournament, which is determined by dividing his total number of points by the tournaments he has played over that two-year period.

There is a minimum divisor of forty tournaments over the two-year ranking period and a maximum divisor of a player's last fifty-two tournaments. Simply put, a golfer's World Ranking is obtained by dividing their points total by the number of events they have played, which gives their average. Players are then ranked; a higher average yields a higher rank.

Data: The data was acquired from the Official World Golf Ranking website and is stored in a long data format. This file will be updated weekly after the conclusion of every tournament.

Tours Included in the Rankings: PGA Tour, European Tour, Asian Tour, PGA Tour of Australasia, Japan Golf Tour, Sunshine Tour, Korn Ferry Tour, Challenge Tour, PGA Tour Canada, Golf Tour, Korean Tour, PGA Tour Latinoam√©rica, Asian Development Tour, PGA Tour China, Alps Tour, Nordic Golf League, PGA EuroPro Tour, ProGolf Tour, MENA Golf Tour, Big Easy Tour, China Tour, and All Thailand Golf Tour.

Collection Method: The data was acquired using the Python library BeautifulSoup and manipulated using the Pandas and NumPy libraries.

Contents: The dataset contains information on nine thousand players.

Acknowledgements: The data was scraped from the Official World Golf Ranking website.

Inspirations: This dataset can be used to predict who will win upcoming PGA Tour tournaments and to predict the players that will make the tournament cuts.

Disclaimer: The Official World Golf Ranking website contains plenty of messy data in the 'Name' column. There are still records where there is not enough information to infer the proper name of the athlete. If the name contains a date within brackets, it is because there are two players with the same name. The date is the birth date of the athlete and is used to uniquely identify athletes with the same name.
