QSAR-TID-101239 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101239. The dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101239. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Citron Rho-interacting kinase, a single protein target that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.

The Citron Rho-interacting kinase is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, and nervous system development. It has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new therapeutic compounds targeting the Citron Rho-interacting kinase.
