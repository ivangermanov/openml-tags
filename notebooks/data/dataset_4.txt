Title: Final settlements in labor negotiations in Canadian industry

The dataset includes all collective agreements reached in the business and personal services sector for locals with at least 500 members (teachers, nurses, university staff, police, etc.) in Canada in 1987 and the first quarter of 1988. The data was sourced from the Collective Bargaining Review, a monthly publication by Labour Canada's Industrial Relations Information Service in Ottawa, Ontario.

This dataset has been used for testing concept learning software, particularly an experimental method to learn two-tiered concept descriptions. The data was utilized to learn the description of acceptable and unacceptable contracts. Unacceptable contracts were either obtained through expert interviews or by inventing near misses. The data was also employed to test a two-tier approach with learning from positive and negative examples.

The dataset consists of 57 instances and 16 attributes. These attributes include duration of agreement, wage increases for the first three years of the contract, cost of living allowance, working hours per week, employer contributions to pension plans, standby pay, shift differential, education allowance, statutory holidays, vacation days, long-term disability assistance, dental plan contributions, bereavement assistance, and health plan contributions.

The class distribution and any exceptions from format instructions are not specified in the provided information. There are no missing attribute values in this dataset.

This labor negotiations dataset provides valuable insights into collective bargaining agreements in the Canadian business and personal services sector, offering a comprehensive view of various contract elements and their distributions across different agreements.
