Title: Letter Image Recognition Data

The objective of this dataset is to identify each of a large number of black and white rectangular pixel displays as one of the twenty-six capital letters in the English alphabet.

The character images were based on twenty different fonts and each letter within these twenty fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of twenty thousand unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into sixteen primitive numerical attributes, including statistical moments and edge counts, which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from zero to fifteen.

We typically train on the first part of the data and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining part. See the referenced article for more details.
