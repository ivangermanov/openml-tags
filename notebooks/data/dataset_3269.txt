The database, named Behavior Urban Traffic, has been created with records of behavior of urban traffic in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This dataset was compiled during a five-day period, from Monday to Friday, capturing information every thirty minutes between seven o'clock in the morning and eight o'clock in the evening.

This comprehensive dataset has been utilized in academic research at the Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management. It provides valuable insights into the various aspects of urban traffic behavior, including the occurrence of accidents involving victims, incidents involving dangerous freight, and points of flooding.

Additionally, the dataset covers other essential features such as immobilized buses, broken trucks, vehicles exceeding speed limits, fires, manifestations, defects in trolleybus networks, trees obstructing roads, malfunctioning semaphores, and slowness in traffic percentages.

Notably, this dataset does not contain any missing values, allowing researchers to conduct thorough analysis without any gaps in the data.
