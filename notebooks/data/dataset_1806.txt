This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero one three four nine, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one zero two four features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and should be cited accordingly.

The target protein is Serine Threonine Protein Kinase Nek Four, also known as Never In Mitosis A Related Kinase Four, NimA Related Protein Kinase Four, Serine Threonine Protein Kinase Two, and Serine Threonine Protein Kinase Nek Four.

It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified under the enzyme kinase protein kinase other protein kinase group other protein kinase NEK family.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, Serine Threonine Protein Kinase Nek Four, Homo sapiens, enzyme kinase, protein kinase, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings.
