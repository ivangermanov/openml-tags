The Haberman dataset contains information from a study conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital. The study focused on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. This dataset is commonly used in statistical analysis and machine learning applications.

The dataset includes 306 instances with four attributes: the age of the patient at the time of operation, the patient's year of operation (calculated as year minus 1900), the number of positive axillary nodes detected, and the survival status. The survival status serves as the class attribute, with two possible outcomes: the patient survived five years or longer, or the patient died within five years.

This dataset has been utilized in various statistical and machine learning studies, particularly in the areas of logistic regression and decision tree analysis. It has been referenced in multiple academic publications and doctoral theses, highlighting its significance in the field of medical data analysis.

The Haberman dataset is complete, with no missing attribute values, making it a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists. It provides a real world example of survival analysis in medical research, offering insights into factors that may influence patient outcomes following breast cancer surgery.

The dataset's features include numerical values for patient age, year of operation, and number of positive axillary nodes, along with a nominal class attribute for survival status. This combination of attributes allows for various types of statistical and predictive analyses, making it a versatile dataset for both educational and research purposes.
