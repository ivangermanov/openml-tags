The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

These datasets are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". The Friedman function is widely used for data generation and includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, with a normalized noise added to the output.

The Friedman function is defined as: Output equals ten times the sine of pi times Input One times Input Two plus twenty times the square of Input Three minus point five squared plus ten times Input Four plus five times Input Five plus noise.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters are given below:

The number of features varies, including only the first five features being related to the output, while the rest are completely random.

The number of samples also varies.

Colinearity degrees vary from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features are generated differently. The other datasets have varying features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
