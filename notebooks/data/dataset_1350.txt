The QSAR-TID-12847 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12847. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited when used.

The target protein is Vitamin K-dependent protein C, also known as activation peptide, anticoagulant protein C, autoprothrombin IIA, and blood coagulation factor fourteen. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, serine protease PA clan, and serine protease S one A subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, blood coagulation, hemostasis, negative regulation of blood coagulation, negative regulation of apoptotic process, negative regulation of inflammatory response, and positive regulation of establishment of endothelial barrier. It is located in the extracellular region, extracellular space, endoplasmic reticulum, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, Golgi apparatus, and Golgi lumen.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, vitamin K-dependent protein C, proteolysis, blood coagulation, hemostasis.
