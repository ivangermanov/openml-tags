Diabetes Dataset 

The Diabetes dataset consists of ten baseline variables and a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline obtained for each of the diabetes patients. 

**Data Set Characteristics:**

The dataset contains a total number of instances and a total number of attributes. The first ten columns comprise numeric predictive values, while the eleventh column represents the target variable, which is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Attribute Information:**

The dataset includes the following attributes: Age, Sex, Body Mass Index, Average Blood Pressure, and six Blood Serum Measurements labeled from one to six. It is essential to note that each of these ten feature variables has been mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation.

**Source:**

The dataset was sourced from a website, which provides detailed information about the dataset.
