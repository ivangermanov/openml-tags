Robot Execution Failures Data Set

Abstract:
This data set contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

Original owner and donor, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Monte da Caparica, Portugal

Data Set Information:
The donation includes five data sets, each defining a different learning problem:

* LP One: failures in approach to grasp position
* LP Two (this data set): failures in transfer of a part
* LP Three: position of part after a transfer failure
* LP Four: failures in approach to ungrasp position
* LP Five: failures in motion with part

In order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies (based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc.) was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of twenty percent in accuracy.

Attribute Information:
All features are numeric, although they are integer-valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection; each failure instance is characterized in terms of fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection; the total observation window for each failure instance was of three hundred fifteen milliseconds. Each example is described as follows:

class Force X One Force Y One Force Z One Torque X One Torque Y One Torque Z One ... Force X Fifteen Force Y Fifteen Force Z Fifteen Torque X Fifteen Torque Y Fifteen Torque Z Fifteen

where Force X One to Force X Fifteen is the evolution of force FX in the observation window, the same for FY, FZ, and the torques; there is a total of ninety features.
