Optical Interconnection Network Data Set

### Data Set Information

All simulations were performed using the OPNET Modeler software. The communication mechanism employed was message passing, where any processor could submit a point-to-point message to the network, destined for any other processor. Calculations were based on an M/M/1 queue, consisting of a First-in-First-Out buffer with packets arriving randomly according to a Poisson arrival process, and a processor retrieving packets from the buffer at a specified service rate. In all simulations, it was assumed that the processor at each node would extract a packet from an input queue, process it for a period of time, and then generate an output data message upon expiration of that period. The size of each input queue was assumed to be infinite, and a processor would become idle only when all its input queues were empty.

### Attribute Information

The attributes of this data set include:

Node Count: The number of nodes present in the network, either eight by eight or four by four.

Thread Count: The initial number of threads present in each node at the start of the simulation.

Spatial Traffic Pattern: The performance of the network was evaluated using synthetic traffic workloads, including uniform, hot region, bit reverse, and perfect shuffle traffic models.

Temporal Traffic Pattern: Temporal distribution of packet generation was implemented through independent traffic sources, utilizing client-server traffic and asynchronous traffic patterns.

Message Transfer and Run Time: Message transfer time was uniformly distributed with a mean ranging from twenty to one hundred clock cycles, while thread run time was exponentially distributed with a mean of one hundred clock cycles.

Processor Utilization: This measures the percentage of time during which threads were actively running on the processor.

Channel Waiting Time: The average time spent by a packet waiting in the output channel queue before being serviced by the channel.

Input Waiting Time: The average time spent by a packet waiting before being serviced by the processor.

Network Response Time: The time elapsed between a request message being enqueued at the output channel and the corresponding data message being received in the input queue.

Channel Utilization: The percentage of time during which the channel was busy transferring packets across the network.
