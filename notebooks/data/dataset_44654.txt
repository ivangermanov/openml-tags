Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Bioresponse with seed one 

Generated with the following source code: 

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It does this by first uniformly sampling classes from the target variable, then uniformly sampling columns from the feature variables, and finally uniformly sampling rows from the resulting dataset. The function also ensures that the subsample is stratified according to the target variable. 

The function takes in several parameters, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes to include in the subsample, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the subsample. 

The function first gets the unique classes in the target variable and selects a subset of these classes to include in the subsample. It then selects the indices of the rows where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the feature and target variables. 

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the feature variables, selecting a subset of the columns to include in the subsample. 

Finally, the function uniformly samples rows from the resulting dataset, selecting a subset of the rows to include in the subsample. 

The function returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original, with the specified number of rows, columns, and classes.
