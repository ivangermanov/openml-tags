Insurance Bayesian Network. Sample One.

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, specifically listed under discrete-medium networks. The Insurance network consists of twenty-seven nodes connected by fifty-two arcs, with a total of one thousand and eight parameters. On average, each node has a Markov blanket size of five point nineteen and an average degree of three point eighty-five, with a maximum in-degree of three.

The Insurance Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model that incorporates various factors influencing insurance policies. It takes into account aspects such as driving history, driving skills, age, vehicle characteristics, and socio-economic status, among others.
