Magic Telescope Seed Two N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This is a subsampled version of the Magic Telescope dataset, which has undergone uniform sampling of classes, columns, and rows. The sampling process involved selecting a specified number of classes, columns, and rows while ensuring that the resulting dataset remains representative of the original.

The subsampling process began with the selection of classes. From the unique classes present in the original dataset, a specified number were chosen through uniform sampling. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the dataset.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled. A specified number of column indices were randomly selected, and the corresponding columns were retained in the dataset.

Finally, the rows were uniformly sampled. The dataset was split into a subset of a specified size using stratified sampling, ensuring that the class distribution remained consistent with the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of a specified number of rows, columns, and classes, which have been carefully selected to maintain the integrity of the original dataset.
