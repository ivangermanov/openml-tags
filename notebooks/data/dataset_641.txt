This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The conversion process involved taking the numeric target feature and converting it into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes several features, including Age and Civil Status.
