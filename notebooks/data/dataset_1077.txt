BNG Audiology Dataset 

Tags: Artificial, BNG, Chemistry, Life Science 

Features: 
The patient is over sixty years old, experiencing air-bone gap, and has an abnormal bone structure. They have a history of buzzing sounds, dizziness, fluctuating hearing loss, feeling of fullness in the ear, hereditary hearing loss, nausea, noise exposure, recruitment phenomenon, ringing, roaring sounds, and vomiting. The patient's audiogram shows poor late wave responses, poor middle wave responses, and specific patterns of hearing loss.

The patient's audiometric test results indicate mixed hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, and specific patterns of hearing thresholds. They exhibit signs of seventh nerve damage, delayed wave V responses, and prolonged waveform I to V responses. The tympanometry test results indicate abnormal middle ear function.
