The QSAR-TID-42 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: forty-two. This dataset has thirteen hundred and two rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand and fifteen. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: forty-two, and it has thirteen hundred and two rows and one thousand and twenty-six features.

The ID for this dataset is CHEMBL two zero nine. It is a single protein preferred name: Trypsin I. It also has synonyms: alpha-trypsin chain one, alpha-trypsin chain two, anionic trypsin I, anionic trypsin-I, beta-trypsin, and many others.

This protein is classified as an enzyme, specifically a protease, and a serine protease. It belongs to the serine protease PA clan and the serine protease S one A subfamily.

This protein is involved in many biological processes, including proteolysis, digestion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. It is also involved in many cellular components, including the extracellular region, extracellular space, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, and blood microparticles.
