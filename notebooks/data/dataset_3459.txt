QSAR-TID-42 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin I, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin I. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is capable of generating fingerprints without requiring missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features are FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular fingerprint. Molecular fingerprints are a way of representing molecules as a series of bits, which can be used for similarity searching and other applications.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR modeling and machine learning.

The dataset is related to the protein target Trypsin I, which is a serine protease. Serine proteases are a family of enzymes that are involved in a variety of biological processes, including digestion and blood clotting. Trypsin I is a specific type of serine protease that is involved in the digestion of proteins.
