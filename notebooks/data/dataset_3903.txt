QSAR-TID-103521 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103521. The dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103521. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Bradykinin B1 receptor, which is a single protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The Bradykinin B1 receptor is a membrane receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including inflammation, pain, and cardiovascular regulation. It is a promising drug target for the treatment of various diseases, including hypertension, inflammation, and cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Bradykinin B1 receptor. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization, among other applications.
