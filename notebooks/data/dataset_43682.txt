Heart Disease Dataset (Most Comprehensive)

Content:

Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular diseases, is a major global health concern, being the leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that cardiovascular diseases claim approximately one-third of all deaths globally, resulting in a staggering loss of life. This group of disorders affects the heart and blood vessels, encompassing conditions such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and others.

Tragically, four out of every five cardiovascular disease-related deaths are attributed to heart attacks and strokes, with a significant proportion occurring prematurely in individuals under the age of seventy. In response to this pressing issue, we have curated a comprehensive dataset by combining multiple existing datasets, previously unavailable in a single compilation. This extensive dataset shares eleven common features, making it the most substantial heart disease dataset available for research purposes.

The five datasets utilized for curation are:

Database of Instances:
Cleveland
Hungarian
Switzerland
Long Beach VA
Stalog (Heart) Data Set

Acknowledgments:
This dataset is derived from three other research datasets employed in distinct research papers. A relevant Nature article listing heart disease databases and popular datasets used in various heart disease research is provided below.
