Name: Arcene Seed Two Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Arcene with seed equals two, arguments nrows equals two thousand, ncols equals one hundred, nclasses equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then uniformly samples classes from the unique values in the target variable, selecting the indices where one of these classes is present. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly. The function then returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and columns.
