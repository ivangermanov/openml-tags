**Meta Album RSD Extended**

The RSD Forty-Six dataset is collected from Google Earth and Tianditu. This collection contains forty-six scene categories, with a total of images. Each scene category has images ranging from five hundred to three thousand. The original resolution of these images is two fifty-six by two fifty-six pixels or five twelve by five twelve pixels. We have created a preprocessed version of RSD for Meta Album by resizing the original dataset to one twenty-eight by one twenty-eight pixels.
