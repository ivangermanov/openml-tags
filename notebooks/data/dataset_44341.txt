**Meta Album RSD Dataset (Extended)**

The RSD46 dataset is collected from Google Earth and Tianditu, containing forty-six scene categories with a total of images. Each scene category has between five hundred to three thousand images. The original resolution is two hundred fifty-six by two hundred fifty-six pixels or five hundred twelve by five hundred twelve pixels. We have created a preprocessed version of RSD for Meta Album by resizing the original dataset to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels.
