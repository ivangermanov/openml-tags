The BNG Solar Flare dataset, tagged as Artificial, BNG, Chemistry, and Life Science, comprises various features that provide insight into solar flares.

This dataset includes a class feature, which categorizes solar flares based on their intensity. The largest spot size feature measures the size of the largest sunspot associated with each flare. The spot distribution feature examines how sunspots are distributed across the surface of the sun.

Additionally, the dataset includes features related to the activity and evolution of solar flares. The activity feature assesses the overall level of activity associated with each flare, while the evolution feature tracks changes in the flare over time. 

Furthermore, the dataset provides information about previous 24-hour flare activity codes, which help researchers understand patterns and trends in solar flare activity. The historically complex feature identifies regions that have exhibited complex behavior in the past, and the did region become historically complex feature indicates whether a region has developed complex behavior over time.

Other features include area, which measures the total area affected by a solar flare, and area of the largest spot, which measures the size of the largest sunspot associated with each flare. The production of different classes of flares, including C-class, M-class, and X-class flares, is also tracked for each region.
