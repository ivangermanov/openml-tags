The Liver Cirrhosis dataset is a medical dataset focused on patients diagnosed with Liver Cirrhosis. It consists of twenty attributes, capturing a variety of clinical and demographic details. The dataset includes both categorical and continuous variables, such as patient status, medication type, biochemical measurements, physical examination findings, and demographic information.

Attribute Description:

Number of Days represents the number of days between registration and the last follow-up or death.

Patient Status at last follow-up is categorized as Died, Censored with Liver failure, or Censored without Liver failure.

Type of Medication used is either D-penicillamine or Placebo.

Age of the patient is recorded in days at the start of the study.

Gender of the patient is either Female or Male.

Presence of Ascites is recorded as Yes or No.

Hepatomegaly, or enlargement of the liver, is recorded as Yes or No.

Presence of spider naevi, a type of angioma, is recorded as Yes or No.

Presence and severity of Edema is recorded as No or Slight.

Serum Bilirubin is measured in milligrams per deciliter.

Serum Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter.

Serum Albumin is measured in grams per deciliter.

Serum Copper is measured in micrograms per deciliter.

Alkaline Phosphatase is measured in units per liter.

Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase is measured in units per milliliter.

Serum Triglycerides are measured in milligrams per deciliter.

Platelet count is recorded per cubic millimeter.

Prothrombin time is recorded as a percentage of normal.

Clinical stage of Cirrhosis is categorized from one to four.

Use Case:

This dataset is essential for researchers and healthcare professionals studying the progression and treatment outcomes of Liver Cirrhosis. It can be used for predictive modeling to identify key indicators of prognosis, treatment efficiency analysis, and understanding demographic correlations with disease outcomes. Moreover, it serves as a valuable resource for training machine learning models aimed at predicting patient survival, response to treatment, and disease progression, contributing to personalized medicine development and better clinical management of Liver Cirrhosis.
