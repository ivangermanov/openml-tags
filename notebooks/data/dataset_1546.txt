QSAR-TID-10623 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10623, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID 

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The dataset contains information about the Serotonin Four receptor, also known as the Five-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor Four or HTR Four. It is a single protein that is primarily found in the cytoplasm, endosome, plasma membrane, and other cellular locations. This receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including signal transduction, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways.
