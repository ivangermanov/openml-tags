This dataset, Beer Reviews, consists of a comprehensive collection of beer reviews from Beer Advocate. The data spans a period of over a decade, including all reviews up to November of a certain year. Each review includes ratings in terms of five distinct aspects: the beer's appearance, its aroma, the palate, the taste, and the overall impression. Reviews include detailed information about the product and the user, followed by each of these five ratings, and a plaintext review. Additionally, we have also included reviews from Rate Beer. The dataset features information about the brewery, the review time, the overall rating, the aroma rating, the appearance rating, the reviewer's profile name, the beer style, the palate rating, the taste rating, the beer name, and the beer's alcohol by volume.
