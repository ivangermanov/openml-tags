QSAR-TID-11615 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine. Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine is a single protein, also known as Ninety-Two KDa Gelatinase, Ninety-Two KDa Type Four Collagenase, Gelatinase B, and Matrix Metalloproteinase-Nine. It belongs to the species Rattus Norvegicus and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M Ten A subfamily.

The dataset has features including Molecule ChEMBL ID, and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine is involved in various biological processes, including skeletal system development, ossification, response to hypoxia, kidney development, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and proteolysis. It is also involved in various cellular components, including extracellular region, extracellular space, and extracellular matrix.
