Data Description 
This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex Aud/Usd pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans a specific period of time and does not include weekends, as the Forex market is not operational on these days. The timestamp feature is based on the Europe Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the close bid and close ask prices of the subsequent minute, relative to the mean of the close bid and close ask prices of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean close price increases in the subsequent minute, and false when the mean close price decreases or remains the same.
