**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Seven**

This Bayesian network repository reference is listed under the discrete-medium category.

The Barley Bayesian Network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of one hundred fourteen thousand and five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, while the average degree is around three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

This preliminary model was developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". It features various factors related to barley growth and production, including characteristics of the soil, weather conditions, and the effects of pesticide use on the crop.

Some notable aspects of this model include its ability to represent complex relationships between different variables, providing insights into the factors that influence barley yield and quality. By analyzing these interactions, researchers can gain a better understanding of how to optimize barley production and improve the overall efficiency of the process.
