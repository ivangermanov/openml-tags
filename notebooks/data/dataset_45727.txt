The Letter Dataset

The objective of this dataset is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the twenty-six capital letters in the English alphabet. The character images were based on twenty different fonts, and each letter within these twenty fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of twenty thousand unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into sixteen primitive numerical attributes, which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from zero through fifteen.

The dataset does not have any missing values. The dataset information is as follows: the letter dataset is a collection of twenty thousand unique stimuli, each representing a capital letter in the English alphabet. The dataset is typically divided into two parts, with the first sixteen thousand items used for training and the remaining four thousand items used for testing.

The additional variable information is as follows: the first variable is the capital letter, which can take on twenty-six values from A to Z. The next five variables describe the physical characteristics of the box containing the letter: the horizontal position of the box, the vertical position of the box, the width of the box, the height of the box, and the total number of on pixels in the box. The next six variables describe the statistical characteristics of the on pixels in the box: the mean x of the on pixels, the mean y of the on pixels, the mean x variance, the mean y variance, the mean x y correlation, and the mean of x times x times y. The final six variables describe the edge count characteristics of the box: the mean edge count from left to right, the correlation of the x edge count with y, the mean edge count from bottom to top, the correlation of the y edge count with x, the mean of x times x times y, and the mean of x times y times y.
