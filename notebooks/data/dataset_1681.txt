QSAR-TID-11154 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11154, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.
