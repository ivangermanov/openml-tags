The Crash dataset is a collection of data based on trials where stock automobiles are crashed into a wall at a moderate speed with crash test dummies in the driver and front passenger seats. The purpose of this dataset is to illustrate the use of basic statistical methods.

The dataset contains information about the make and model of each car, as well as details about the crash test itself, including the head injury criterion, chest deceleration, and leg loads for both the left and right legs. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the type of protection used, such as seat belts or air bags, and the number of doors on each car.

Other variables include the year of the car, its weight, and a categorical variable to classify the cars into different types, such as light or minivan. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various factors related to car crashes and their effects on crash test dummies.
