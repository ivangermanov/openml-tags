The Airline Ticket Price dataset is concerned with predicting airline ticket prices. The rows represent a sequence of time-ordered observations over several days. Each sample in this dataset represents a set of observations from a specific observation date and departure date pair. The input variables for each sample are values that may be useful for predicting airline ticket prices for a specific departure date.

The target variables in this dataset are the next day price or minimum price observed over the next seven days for six target flight preferences: any airline with any number of stops, any airline non-stop only, Delta Airlines, Continental Airlines, Airtrain Airlines, and United Airlines.

The input variables include the following types: the number of days between the observation date and the departure date, boolean variables for day-of-the-week of the observation date, the complete enumeration of the following four values: the minimum price, mean price, and number of quotes from all airlines and from each airline quoting more than fifty percent of the observation days for non-stop, one-stop, and two-stop flights, for the current day, previous day, and two days previous. This results in a feature set of four hundred eleven variables.

This dataset is heterogeneous with a mixture of several types of variables including boolean variables, prices, and counts.

Features: Departure Weekday Type, Fetch Days, Fetch Day of Week, Days To Departure, Minimum Prices, Average Prices, Number of Quotes, and many others...
