Consumer Price Index in Denver CO

Tags: Machine Learning, Transportation

The Consumer Price Indexes program produces monthly data on changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. It is a useful way to compare changes in the economy across time.

This data covers a significant period of time and is normalized to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, which serves as a benchmark. The fields included in this dataset are the time of measurement and the corresponding Consumer Price Index score.

Acknowledgement is given to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Colorado Department of Labor Employment for compiling this dataset, which is hosted on the official website of the State of Colorado.

This dataset raises important questions, such as what periods of time have seen the highest or lowest Consumer Price Index, when has inflation been the worst, and whether it is possible to predict the current Consumer Price Index based on historical trends.

State FIPS Code, Area, Area Type, Period, Period Year, Period Type, Period Type Description, Consumer Price Index, Title, Type, Source, Consumer Price Index Source Description, Percent Change Year, Percent Change Month, Data Region, Area Name, and Area Description.
