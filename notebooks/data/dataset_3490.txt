QSAR-TID-20033 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20033. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20033. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Serotonin Four receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as the Five-HT Four receptor, and it belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission.

The dataset provides information on the receptor's function, including its role in maintaining the gastrointestinal epithelium, regulating appetite, and secreting mucus. The receptor is also involved in the large intestinal transit process.
