Diabetes Dataset
----------------

Ten baseline variables were obtained for each of the diabetes patients, including age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The response of interest is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

The dataset consists of a large number of instances, with numerous attributes providing valuable insights into the disease. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression, which is essential for understanding the disease's behavior over time.

**Attribute Information:**

* Age represents the patient's age in years.
* Sex is an important demographic characteristic that plays a significant role in the study.
* Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used indicator of health risks associated with obesity.
* Average Blood Pressure is a critical factor in determining the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
* Total Serum Cholesterol measures the overall level of cholesterol in the blood.
* Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL) are often referred to as "bad" cholesterol due to their association with increased cardiovascular risks.
* High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL) are considered "good" cholesterol, which helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream.
* Total Cholesterol/HDL ratio provides valuable information about the overall lipid profile.
* Log of Serum Triglycerides Level is an essential attribute for understanding lipid metabolism.
* Blood Sugar Level is a critical factor in diagnosing and managing diabetes.

Note: Each of these ten feature variables has been mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the square root of the number of samples, resulting in a sum of squares of each column totaling one.
