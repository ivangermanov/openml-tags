Car Seed Zero Number Rows Two Thousand Number Classes Ten Number Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Car dataset, comprising four thousand ninety-seven five records. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows.

The Car dataset was generated using a Python function that takes several arguments, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are represented proportionally to their frequency in the original dataset. It then selects the corresponding records from the dataset.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the resulting dataset, ensuring that the selected columns are representative of the entire dataset. Finally, the function applies stratified sampling to select the desired number of records, taking into account the class distribution.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original records, with a reduced number of columns and classes. This subsampled dataset is suitable for machine learning experiments and other applications where a smaller, more manageable dataset is required.
