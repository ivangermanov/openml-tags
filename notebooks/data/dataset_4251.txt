The Meta Album Animals with Attributes Dataset (Micro) is a comprehensive collection of images designed to benchmark transfer-learning algorithms, particularly attribute-based classification and zero-shot learning. This dataset consists of more than thirty-seven thousand images from fifty animal classes, where each animal corresponds to a specific class. The images were gathered from public sources, such as Flickr, in two thousand sixteen, considering only images licensed for free use and redistribution.

Each class can contain anywhere from one hundred to one thousand six hundred forty-five images, with resolutions ranging from one hundred by one hundred pixels to one thousand eight hundred ninety-three by one thousand nine hundred twenty pixels. To preprocess this dataset, the images were cropped from either side to make them square. If an image had a resolution lower than one hundred twenty-eight pixels, the squared images were created by either duplicating the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and rightmost three columns based on the orientation of the original image. Finally, the square images were resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
