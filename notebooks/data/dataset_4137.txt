The Dorothea dataset is a collection of chemical compounds represented by structural molecular features, which need to be classified as active (binding to thrombin) or inactive. This dataset is part of the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge.

The original dataset was created for the KDD Cup 2001 competition, where DuPont Pharmaceuticals graciously provided the data. The dataset was later modified for the feature selection challenge by adding distractor features called probes, which have no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.

Drugs are typically small organic molecules that achieve their desired activity by binding to a target site on a receptor. The first step in the discovery of a new drug is usually to identify and isolate the receptor to which it should bind, followed by testing many small molecules for their ability to bind to the target site. This leaves researchers with the task of determining what separates the active compounds from the inactive ones. Such a determination can then be used in the design of new compounds that not only bind but also have all the other properties required for a drug, such as solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action, and toxicity.

The dataset has been divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set consists of positive and negative examples, where active compounds are mapped to the target value plus one (positive examples), and inactive compounds are mapped to the target value minus one (negative examples).

The dataset contains real features and probe features, totaling one hundred thousand features. The data are in a specific format, including parameters and statistics about the data, identities of the features, and labels for training and validation examples.
