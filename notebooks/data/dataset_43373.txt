The Reddit Wall Street Bets Posts dataset is a collection of posts from the Wall Street Bets subreddit, a community where users discuss stock and option trading. This subreddit has gained notoriety for its profane nature and allegations of users manipulating securities. Recently, the community has gained mainstream attention again due to its interest in GameStop shares.

The dataset contains a small percentage of harsh language, as the posts were not filtered. The data was downloaded from the Wall Street Bets subreddit using the Python Reddit API Wrapper.

This dataset can be used for various purposes, such as performing sentiment analysis to gauge the emotions and opinions of the community, identifying discussion topics and trends, and following the emergence of popular keywords and trends, such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment, and Nokia.

The dataset features include the title of the post, the score, the unique identifier, the URL, the number of comments, the creation date, the body of the post, and the timestamp.

Keywords: stock trading, option trading, GameStop, sentiment analysis, trend analysis.
