QSAR-TID-12347 Dataset: Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12347. It consists of sixteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
