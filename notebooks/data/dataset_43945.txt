The Electricity dataset is a widely used collection of data points described and analyzed in various research papers. This data was gathered from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, where prices fluctuate based on demand and supply. To mitigate these fluctuations, electricity transfers were made to and from the neighboring state of Victoria.

The dataset, originally named ELEC2, contains a large number of instances dated from May seven nineteen ninety-six to December five nineteen ninety-eight. Each example in the dataset refers to a thirty-minute period, resulting in forty-eight instances for each twenty-four-hour time period. Each example has several fields, including the day of the week, the timestamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label.

The class label identifies the change of the price, either up or down, in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours. This approach removes the impact of longer-term price trends. The data was normalized to facilitate analysis.

Attribute information includes the date, which ranges from May seven nineteen ninety-six to December five nineteen ninety-eight; the day of the week; the period, representing the time of measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours; the New South Wales electricity price; the New South Wales electricity demand; the Victoria electricity price; the Victoria electricity demand; and the scheduled electricity transfer between both states.
