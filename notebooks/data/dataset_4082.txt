QSAR-TID-12173 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12173. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Dopamine D4 receptor, which is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including behavioral fear response, synaptic transmission, and locomotory behavior. The receptor is also involved in the regulation of dopamine metabolic process, circadian rhythm, and response to amphetamine.

The dataset provides a detailed description of the Dopamine D4 receptor, including its synonyms, such as D(2C) dopamine receptor, D(4) dopamine receptor, and Drd4. The receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including signal transduction, synaptic transmission, and neurotransmitter receptor activity.

The dataset also includes information about the receptor's function, including its role in behavioral fear response, synaptic transmission, and locomotory behavior. The receptor is also involved in the regulation of dopamine metabolic process, circadian rhythm, and response to amphetamine.
