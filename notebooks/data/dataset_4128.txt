QSAR-TID-10803 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10803. The dataset has thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a set of numerical values. These values can be used to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target. The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints used in this dataset are a type of molecular fingerprint that is commonly used in QSAR modeling.

The dataset is provided in a format that is easy to use and analyze, with each row representing a single compound and each column representing a feature of that compound. The dataset can be used for a variety of purposes, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization.

The MetaQSAR project is a collaborative effort, and the dataset is made available to the scientific community to facilitate research and development in the field of drug discovery.
