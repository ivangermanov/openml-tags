QSAR-TID-10803 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10803. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset consists of thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four one, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four two, and so on.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.
