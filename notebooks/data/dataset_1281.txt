This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target LIM Domain Kinase Two, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains information about LIM Domain Kinase Two, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also includes information about expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, wikipedia, canSAR-target, guide to pharmacology, int act, pharm gkb, pharos, reactome, uniprot, interpro, pfam, and pdb e.

The dataset has multiple features including molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty. The molecule chembl id is a unique identifier for each molecule, and the median pxc fifty is a measure of the molecule's activity.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
