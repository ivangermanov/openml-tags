Tags: Government, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11047. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The data was scraped from various sources, including the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide high-quality QSAR datasets for machine learning modeling. 

The target protein is dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase four, also known as c-Jun N-terminal kinase kinase one, JNK-activating kinase one, and JNKK. It is an enzyme that belongs to the STE protein kinase group and STE seven family.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, JUN kinase kinase activity, kinase activity, transferase activity, and molecular adaptor activity.

It is also involved in several cellular components, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, axon, dendrite cytoplasm, and perikaryon.
