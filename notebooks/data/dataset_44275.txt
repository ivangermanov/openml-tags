**Meta-Album Animals with Attributes Dataset (Micro)**

The original Animals with Attributes Two dataset was designed to benchmark transfer-learning algorithms, particularly attribute-based classification and zero-shot learning. It has a large collection of images from fifty animal classes, where each animal corresponds to a class. The images of this dataset were collected from public sources, such as Flickr, considering only images licensed for free use and redistribution. Each class can have a varying number of images with different resolutions. To preprocess this dataset, we cropped the images from either side to make them square. In case an image has a low resolution, the squared images are done by either duplicating the top and bottom-most rows or the left and right most columns based on the orientation of the original image. Lastly, the square images are resized into a uniform size using an anti-aliasing filter.
