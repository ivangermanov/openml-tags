Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using uniform random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, selecting a specified number of columns from the filtered data. If the number of rows in the filtered data exceeds the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows, ensuring that the distribution of classes is maintained.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string format and returns the new dataset with the selected features, target variable, and categorical mask.
