Myanmar Air Quality (2019 to 2020 October)

Tags: Context

Since Myanmar is one of the developing countries, a large number of factories were set up and the number of cars increased rapidly during the previous years. As a result, Myanmar's air quality was also dramatically decreasing during the last years. Moreover, Myanmar's air quality reached a critically poor level globally in recent years. So, I created this dataset to analyze and to try some predictions.

Data is from Purple Air and cleaned by using Power BI.

This dataset is a part of the project which is initialized to compete in Myanmar's air quality visualization competitions.

I hope this dataset can help the field of data science and the air quality of Myanmar.
