This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Three Thousand Forty-Three, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Hundred Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically Study Three, and it falls under the categories of Demographics and MTLQSAR.
