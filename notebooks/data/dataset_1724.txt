QSAR-TID-10876 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10876. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset includes the molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty as the class feature. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
