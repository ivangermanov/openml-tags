The QSAR-TID-20033 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20033. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The molecular fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

This dataset shows activity values of several compounds on the serotonin four receptor, also known as the five hydroxytryptamine receptor four. This receptor is a single protein and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor and a small molecule receptor.

The serotonin four receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, chemical synaptic transmission, maintenance of gastrointestinal epithelium, regulation of appetite, mucus secretion, and large intestinal transit.

Keywords: QSAR, serotonin four receptor, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, chemical synaptic transmission.
