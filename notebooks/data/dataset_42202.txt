This dataset is an artificial simulation of the Duffing System with random changes from the chaotic to the non-chaotic regime at different noise levels. The Duffing System is a mathematical model that exhibits chaotic behavior, and this dataset aims to detect and analyze this chaos.

The dataset features a range of variables, including the index and time of each data point, as well as the x and y coordinates. Additionally, it includes various statistical measures, such as the maximum, mean, and minimum values over different time intervals. The dataset also incorporates features derived from Fourier analysis, such as the frequency components, as well as topological features, including the number of holes and the average lifetime of these holes.

Furthermore, the dataset includes Betti numbers, which are a measure of the topological complexity of the system, as well as the amplitude and noise level of the signal. Finally, the dataset is divided into a test set, which can be used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
