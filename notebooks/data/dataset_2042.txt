This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one twenty-three, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and nine hundred twenty-six more molecular fingerprints.
