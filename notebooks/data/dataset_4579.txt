Tags: Subsampling of the dataset CNAE Nine 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original CNAE Nine dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes and columns, followed by stratified sampling of rows.

The class sampling process begins by identifying unique classes in the dataset. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, which is ten in this case, a random selection of classes is made based on their frequency in the dataset. This ensures that the sampled classes are representative of the original class distribution.

Next, the column sampling process takes place. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, which is one hundred in this case, a random selection of columns is made. The selected columns are then used to create a new dataset.

Finally, the row sampling process occurs. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, which is two thousand in this case, a stratified sampling approach is used to select the desired number of rows. This approach ensures that the sampled rows are representative of the original class distribution.

The resulting dataset consists of the sampled rows and columns, along with their corresponding class labels. The categorical mask, which indicates the categorical columns, is also preserved.
