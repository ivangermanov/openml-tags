QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on cGMP dependent protein kinase, also known as cGMP dependent protein kinase PKG. This single protein target is found in Eimeria tenella. It is classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase in the AGC protein kinase group and AGC protein kinase PKG family.

The protein is associated with several cellular components including the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and general membrane structures. Its molecular functions encompass nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, cGMP dependent protein kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, cGMP binding, and metal ion binding. The biological processes it is involved in are protein phosphorylation and general phosphorylation.

This target protein has entries in various databases including canSAR Target, UniProt, and InterPro. The InterPro database lists several domains and features for this protein, such as cNMP binding domain, protein kinase domain, AGC kinase C terminal, serine/threonine kinase active site, kinase like domain superfamily, RmlC like jellyroll, protein kinase ATP binding site, cNMP binding conserved site, cNMP binding domain superfamily, and STKc cGK.

The Pfam database identifies two key domains in this protein: cNMP binding and protein kinase domains. These structural elements contribute to the protein's function and interactions within the cell.
