QSAR-TID-20158 Tags: Chemistry, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20158. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains a molecule ChEMBL ID feature, as well as numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features. These fingerprints are molecular representations used to describe the structural properties of molecules.

The data was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. 

Scraped Data:

The drug target is a single protein, specifically a cyclic guanosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase. This enzyme belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and PKG family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation and phosphorylation.

The enzyme is localized in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and membrane. It has multiple functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, cyclic guanosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, cyclic guanosine monophosphate binding, and metal ion binding.
