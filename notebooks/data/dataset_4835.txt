Abalone 

Tags: Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, Regression on Both Numerical and Categorical Features 

This dataset belongs to the regression on both numerical and categorical features benchmark. 

Original Description: 
Make target age numeric.

Title of Database: Abalone Data 

Sources:
Original owners of database: Marine Resources Division Marine Research Laboratories 
Donor of database: Department of Computer Science, University of Tasmania 
Date received: December 

Past Usage: Extending and benchmarking Cascade-Correlation 
Test set performance: Cascade-Correlation, Linear Discriminate Analysis, k=5 Nearest Neighbour 
Data set samples are highly overlapped. 
Further information is required to separate completely using affine combinations. 
Other restrictions to data set examined.

Relevant Information Paragraph: 
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. 
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope – a boring and time-consuming task. 
Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. 
Further information, such as weather patterns and location, hence food availability, may be required to solve the problem.

Number of Attributes: 
Attribute Information: 
Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit, and a brief description. 
The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

Attribute Information:

* Sex: nominal – Male, Female, and Infant
* Length: continuous – longest shell measurement in millimeters
* Diameter: continuous – perpendicular to length in millimeters
* Height: continuous – with meat in shell in millimeters
* Whole Weight: continuous – whole abalone in grams
* Shucked Weight: continuous – weight of meat in grams
* Viscera Weight: continuous – gut weight after bleeding in grams
* Shell Weight: continuous – after being dried in grams
* Rings: integer – +1.5 gives the age in years

Statistics for Numeric Domains:
