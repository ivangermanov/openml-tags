QSAR-TID-247 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 247. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.
