QSAR-TID-247 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 247. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1171 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The Endothelin receptor ET-B is a single protein, also known as EDNRB, Endothelin receptor non-selective type, Endothelin receptor type B, ET-B, ET-BR. It is a membrane receptor, a family A G protein-coupled receptor, a peptide receptor, and a short peptide receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, neural crest cell migration, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and regulation of heart rate.

The receptor is targeted by various compounds, including RG-7636, an antibody that binds to Endothelin receptor ET-B, and small molecules such as ENRASENTAN, DARUSENTAN, and TEZOSENTAN, which are Endothelin receptor ET-B antagonists.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and membrane. It is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of pH.
