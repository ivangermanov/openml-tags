The BNG (Ailerons) dataset is an artificial collection focusing on aircraft control surfaces, specifically ailerons. It includes various flight parameters and sensor measurements related to aircraft movement and positioning. The dataset captures important aspects of flight dynamics, including climb rate, pitch, roll, and sensor elapsed times. These features provide a comprehensive view of an aircraft's behavior and control responses during flight. The inclusion of difference calculations for several parameters allows for analysis of changes over time, which is crucial for understanding aircraft performance and control effectiveness.
