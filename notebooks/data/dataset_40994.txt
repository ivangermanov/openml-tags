This dataset contains records of simulation crashes encountered during climate model uncertainty quantification ensembles. Ensemble members were constructed using a Latin hypercube method in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Uncertainty Quantification Pipeline software system to sample the uncertainties of eighteen model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program component of the Community Climate System Model. Three separate Latin hypercube ensembles were conducted, each containing one hundred eighty ensemble members. A significant number of simulations failed for numerical reasons at combinations of parameter values.

The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) from input parameter values, and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to determine the causes of simulation crashes. Further details about the data and methods are given in the publication "Failure Analysis of Parameter-Induced Simulation Crashes in Climate Models".

Attribute Information:

The goal is to predict climate model simulation outcomes given scaled values of climate model input parameters. The dataset consists of eighteen climate model parameters scaled in the interval from zero to one, and the simulation outcome, which is either failure or success.
