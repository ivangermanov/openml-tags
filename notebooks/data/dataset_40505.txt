The Tree Pipit dataset provides information on the population density of Tree Pipits, Anthus trivialis, in Franconian oak forests, along with variables describing the forest ecosystem. This data is taken from the R package coin. The study is based on fieldwork conducted in lowland oak forests in the Franconian region of northern Bavaria, close to Uffenheim, Germany. Diurnal breeding birds were sampled multiple times, from the beginning of spring to the start of summer, using a quantitative grid mapping approach. Each grid consisted of a one-hectare square area. In total, numerous sample sites were established in several stands. All individual birds were counted during time intervals while slowly walking along the middle of the grid with a stop in the center. Environmental factors were measured for each grid, including the age of the forest, the cover of the storey, the cover of regenerating trees, the mean height of regenerating trees, the presence of coniferous trees, dead trees, and piles of cut branches, as well as the distance from the forest edge.
