Wall-Robot-Navigation Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Derived, Life Science, Study 

The data were collected as the SCITOS G5 robot navigates through the room following the wall in a clockwise direction, for four rounds, using twenty-four ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its waist. 

Abstract:
The Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data Set contains the raw values of the measurements of all twenty-four ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label. Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of nine samples per second. 

Data Set Information:
The provided file contains the raw values of the measurements of all twenty-four ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label. The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a nonlinearly separable classification task. 

Attribute Information:
Number of Attributes: two numeric attributes and the class.

For Each Attribute:
File sensor_readings_data contains:

One. Front Minimum Distance: minimum sensor reading within a sixty-degree arc located at the front of the robot - numeric real.
Two. Left Minimum Distance: minimum sensor reading within a sixty-degree arc located at the left of the robot - numeric real.
Three. Class: Move Forward, Slight Right Turn, Sharp Right Turn, Slight Left Turn.
