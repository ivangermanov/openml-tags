Fri C One Dataset: A Binarized Version for Chemical Analysis and Life Sciences

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MythBusting, Study Aid

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It has been modified to convert the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features relevant to chemical analysis and life sciences, although some of these features may not be easily interpretable.

Binary Class is the target feature in this dataset, which has been classified into Positive and Negative categories.
