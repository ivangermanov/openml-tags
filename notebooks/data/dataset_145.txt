This data set concerns the comprehensive study of the factors affecting patterns of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in children. The primary objective of this research is to thoroughly investigate the dependence of the level of serum C peptide on the various other significant factors in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex patterns of residual insulin secretion. The response measurement employed in this study is the logarithm of C peptide concentration, measured in picomoles per milliliter, at the time of diagnosis. Additionally, the predictor measurements used include age and base deficit, which serves as a reliable measure of acidity.

The original source of this data set is attributed to the esteemed book titled Generalized Additive Models, written by renowned authors. This valuable resource has been made available through an online collection of regression data sets curated by a prominent researcher.

Characteristics of this data set include forty three distinct cases, each comprising three continuous variables.
