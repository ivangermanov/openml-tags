This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Calpain Two, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty. The features represent FCFP One Thousand Twenty Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September Two Thousand Fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version Seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calpain Two. Calpain Two is also known as Calcium Activated Neutral Proteinase Two, Calpain Two Catalytic Subunit, Calpain Two Large Subunit, Calpain Large Polypeptide L Two, and Calpain M Type. It belongs to the species group Homo Sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, cysteine protease, cysteine protease CA clan, and cysteine protease C Two family.

The dataset provides information about the expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process of Calpain Two. It also includes information from various databases such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. The dataset is related to various biological processes including response to hypoxia, blastocyst development, proteolysis, myoblast fusion, female pregnancy, and response to mechanical stimulus.
