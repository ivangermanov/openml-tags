The spectrometer dataset contains information from the Infra-Red Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) Low Resolution Spectrometer Database. This dataset was created in approximately March 1988 and was donated by an individual from a NASA research group. The IRAS project was groundbreaking as it represented the first attempt to map the entire sky at infrared wavelengths, which was impossible from ground-based observatories due to atmospheric absorption of large portions of the infrared spectrum.

The primary observing program of IRAS involved high-resolution sky mapping by scanning at four frequencies. Additionally, the Low Resolution Observation program observed high-intensity sources across two continuous spectral bands. This particular database is derived from a subset of higher-quality LRS observations taken between 12 and 24 hours right ascension.

The dataset comprises 531 high-quality spectra from the IRAS-LRS database. Originally, the data contained 100 spectral measurements in each of two overlapping bands. However, only 44 blue band and 49 red band channels containing usable flux measurements are included in this dataset. The original spectral intensity values were compressed to four digits, with each spectrum including five rescaling parameters. These values were then rescaled to units of spectral intensity (Janskys) using the LRS-specified algorithm. To eliminate total intensity differences, each spectrum was normalized to a mean value of 5000.

This database was initially obtained for the development and testing of the AutoClass system for Bayesian classification. While the results from this development were not retained, efforts were concentrated on a larger 5425-element version of the same data. Classifications were based on simultaneous modeling of all 93 spectral intensities. The larger database allowed for the identification of classes corresponding to known spectral types associated with particular stellar types, as well as classes matching spectra expected from certain stellar processes under investigation by astronomers. These classifications significantly expanded the set of stars being studied by researchers.

The dataset contains various attributes including LRS name, LRS class, ID type, right ascension, declination, scale factor, blue base coefficients, red base coefficients, and flux measurements from both blue-band and red-band channel wavelengths. The LRS class values range from 0 to 99, with the tens digit indicating the basic class and the ones digit indicating the subclass. These classes are based on features such as peaks, valleys, and trends of the spectral curves.
