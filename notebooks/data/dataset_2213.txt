QSAR-TID-163 Dataset 

Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
