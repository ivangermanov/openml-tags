Insurance Bayesian Network Sample Five

This Insurance Bayesian Network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which provides a comprehensive collection of Bayesian networks for research and educational purposes.

The Insurance Bayesian Network Sample Five consists of twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point nineteen, while the average degree is approximately three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network represents a probabilistic model for predicting insurance premiums based on various factors, including driving history, vehicle characteristics, and socioeconomic status.

Features included in this network are driving history, driving skill, age, ruggedness of the automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft devices, driving quality, risk aversion, good student discounts, ownership of other cars, make and model, accident history, socioeconomic status, home base, property cost, car value, anti-lock brakes, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft rates, airbags, medical costs, senior training, and cushioning.
