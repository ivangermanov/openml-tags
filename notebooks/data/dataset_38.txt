The dataset "sick" is associated with various tags including mythbusting, OpenML-CC, OpenML, and multiple study identifiers. It originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and focuses on thyroid disease records.

This dataset contains information about thyroid conditions, with attributes such as age, sex, medication usage, pregnancy status, surgical history, and various thyroid-related measurements. The data includes both categorical and continuous variables, with some instances of missing values.

The dataset comprises multiple databases from an institute in Sydney, Australia. These databases typically contain training and test instances, with a significant amount of missing data across approximately 29 attributes. The attributes are either boolean or continuously valued.

Additional databases related to hypothyroid and sick euthyroid conditions are included, although there are concerns about potential corruption in these specific datasets. The format of these additional databases closely resembles the others in the collection.

There is also a larger database with over 9000 instances covering 20 classes, accompanied by a related domain theory. Another thyroid database in the collection has three classes, 215 instances, and five attributes without any missing values.

The dataset includes a thyroid database specifically designed for training artificial neural networks. This particular database consists of three classes with separate training and testing instances. It also incorporates cost data.

The features in the dataset encompass a wide range of thyroid-related factors, including various hormone measurements (TSH, T3, TT4, T4U, FTI, TBG), patient demographics, medical history, and referral sources.
