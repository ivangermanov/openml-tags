This dataset contains health and medicine-related information about thyroid disease. It consists of thirty attributes, including seven continuous and twenty-three discrete ones. The dataset has 3772 instances, with approximately five point four percent missing values.

Attribute Information:

The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, whether the patient is on thyroxine or not, if they had a query about being on thyroxine, whether they are on anti-thyroid medication, if they are sick, pregnant, had thyroid surgery, received I131 treatment, and more. 

There are also attributes related to measurements of various hormones, such as TSH, T3, TT4, T4U, FTI, and TBG, including whether these measurements were taken or not. 

Finally, the dataset includes the referral source of the patient.

Dataset Information:

This dataset was supplied by the Garavan Institute. It has approximately six databases from the institute, with plenty of missing data. There are two additional corrupted datasets, Hypothyroid.data and sick-euthyroid.data, which are highly similar in format to the other datasets. 

Another thyroid database covers twenty classes and has a related domain theory. There is also a thyroid database suitable for training artificial neural networks, which has three classes and includes cost data.
