**Used Cars in KSA**

This project displays used cars from many different brands for sale. The website features a vast collection of vehicles, and I have created a data frame for them, with each car having nine distinct features. The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the car's price based on its characteristics.

Assigning a fair price to a used car is a significant challenge, as it largely depends on its features after usage. Therefore, I have made an effort to collect as many relevant features as possible to give machine learning the best chance to allocate an accurate price for each car.

The type of modeling that matches my data is a supervised model, as it includes a label 'car price', and I will be using a regression type because the target is a numerical value. Additionally, this data can also be utilized for a recommender system.

The features of the cars include Car Name, Car Brand, Year, Maximum Mileage in kilometers, Minimum Mileage in kilometers, Kind, City of Owner, Condition, Kind of Motor, Color, and Price.
