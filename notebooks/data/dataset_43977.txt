The Jannis dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark, transformed in a uniform way to facilitate classification on numerical features. This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark, where the goal is to expose the research community to real-world datasets of interest. 

All datasets are formatted uniformly, although the type of data may differ. The data are provided as preprocessed matrices, allowing participants to focus on classification, although they are welcome to use additional feature extraction procedures as long as they do not violate any rules of the challenge. 

All problems are binary classification problems and are assessed with the normalized Area Under the ROC Curve metric. The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, although its structure is revealed. The final score will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets, and a ranking will be generated from such results, determining the winners according to such ranking. 

The tasks are constrained by a time budget, and the Codalab platform provides computational resources shared by all participants. Each code submission will be executed in a compute worker with specific characteristics, ensuring the fairness of the evaluation. When a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited to ensure fairness.

Keywords: tabular data, classification, numerical features, binary classification, Area Under the ROC Curve, computational resources, time budget.
