This dataset was part of the assignment of my coursework. It contains over ninety columns describing different aspects of all countries, including Gross Domestic Product, Population, Electricity Consumption, and many more. Most of the fields are explained in the provided link, while others are standard terms that can be easily searched for.

Inspiration

Gross Domestic Product prediction is the most important task in this dataset. Other tasks include the prediction of other fields. Since the dataset is relatively small, it is interesting to see how much accuracy can be reached with it.
