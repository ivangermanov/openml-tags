Country Data 

Tags: Economics, Machine Learning 

This dataset was a part of the assignment of coursework. 

The dataset contains over ninety columns describing various aspects of all countries, including Gross Domestic Product, population, electricity consumption, and many more. Most of the fields are self-explanatory; however, some require further explanation, which can be found through online research.

Acknowledgments 

This dataset is derived from the Central Intelligence Agency.

Inspiration 
Predicting Gross Domestic Product is the primary task for this dataset. Additionally, predicting other fields is also an objective. Given the relatively small size of the dataset, it will be interesting to observe the level of accuracy achievable.
