Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

The final feature is labeled as "binaryClass", which likely represents the target variable that has been converted into a binary classification.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the original target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value falls below or above this mean threshold.

The purpose of this binarization may be to simplify the original problem or to make it more suitable for certain types of analysis or machine learning algorithms that work specifically with binary classification tasks.

Without more information about the original dataset or the specific domain this data relates to, it is challenging to provide more detailed insights into the nature or purpose of these features.
