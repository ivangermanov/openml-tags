QSAR-TID-13067 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 13067. The dataset has 540 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 13067. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has 540 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The target is a single protein, specifically the Cholecystokinin B receptor, also known as CCK2-R, Cckbr, CCK-BR, CCK-B receptor, and Cholecystokinin-2 receptor. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes, including gastric acid secretion, histamine secretion, behavioral defense response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The receptor is also involved in the regulation of cell population proliferation, synaptic transmission, and response to insulin. It is also associated with various diseases, including gastritis, peptic ulcer, and pancreatic cancer.
