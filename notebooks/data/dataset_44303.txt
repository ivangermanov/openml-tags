The Meta-Album Plant Doc Dataset (Mini) is a collection of images of healthy and unhealthy plant leaves. These images were originally downloaded from Google Images and Ecosia, and later cropped by the authors, resulting in one complete leaf fitting in one image. The original, uncropped images vary in scale, light conditions, and pose; however, within one category, images of leaves that came from the same original image can be found. The images correspond to twenty-seven classes, including plant disease names and plant species names, such as Corn Leaf Blight and Cherry Leaf respectively.

The dataset was created for benchmarking classification models, published in a research paper by Singh et al. The PlantDoc dataset in the Meta-Album benchmark is extracted from a preprocessed version of the original PlantDoc dataset. To ensure independent and identically distributed samples, only one leaf image per each original image is randomly picked. Then, leaves images are cropped and made into squared images, which are then resized into 128x128 pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
