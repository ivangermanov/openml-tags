**Meta Album Plant Doc Dataset (Mini)**

The Plant Doc dataset is composed of images of leaves of healthy and unhealthy plants. The images were downloaded from Google Images and Ecosia, and later cropped by the authors, so generally, one complete leaf fits in one image. The original, uncropped images are generally different in scale, light conditions, and pose. However, within one category, images of leaves that came from the same original image can be found. The images correspond to plant disease names and plant species names, for example, Corn Leaf Blight and Cherry Leaf respectively. The dataset was created for a benchmarking classification model work, published in a research paper.
