QSAR-TID-30041 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30041. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30041. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 30041, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase thirty-six.

The dataset contains information about the target protein, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target protein is a serine/threonine-protein kinase thirty-six, which is a single protein that belongs to the ULK family.

The dataset also contains information about the protein's expression, including its expression in different tissues and its subcellular localization. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and extracellular region.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the protein's function, including its role in various biological processes, such as protein phosphorylation, smoothened signaling pathway, and brain development. The protein also interacts with other proteins and molecules, including ATP, metal ions, and transcription corepressors.
