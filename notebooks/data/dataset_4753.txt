Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup Ninety Nine with Seed Equal to Three 

Tags: Health, Medicine 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original KDD Cup Ninety Nine dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether or not to use stratification. The resulting dataset has been tailored to meet these specific requirements.

The subsampling process involved several key steps. First, the unique classes in the original dataset were identified and then uniformly sampled down to the desired maximum number of classes. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to select the corresponding data points from the original dataset. Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled down to the desired maximum number of columns. If the dataset still had more rows than desired after these steps, it was further subsampled using stratification to ensure that the resulting dataset retained an appropriate balance of classes.

The features of this dataset include duration, protocol type, service, flag, source bytes, destination bytes, land, wrong fragment, urgent, hot, number of failed logins, logged in, number of compromised, root shell, SU attempted, number of root, number of file creations, number of shells, number of access files, number of outbound commands, is host login, is guest login, count, server count, service error rate, server service error rate, retransmission error rate, server retransmission error rate, same server rate, different server rate, server different host rate, destination host count, destination host server count, destination host same server rate, destination host different server rate, destination host same source port rate, destination host server different host rate, destination host service error rate, destination host server service error rate, destination host retransmission error rate, destination host server retransmission error rate, and target.
