QSAR-TID-11726 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11726. The dataset has fifty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to Aminopeptidase A, which is a single protein target. Aminopeptidase A is also known as Glutamyl Aminopeptidase and is a metalloprotease enzyme that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, blood pressure regulation, and cell migration.

The dataset contains information on the expression of Aminopeptidase A in different tissues and its involvement in various biological processes. It also includes data on the inhibition of Aminopeptidase A by small molecules, which is an important area of research in drug discovery.
