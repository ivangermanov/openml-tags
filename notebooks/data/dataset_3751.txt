QSAR-TID-100613 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100613. The dataset has fifty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100613. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Proteasome Macropain subunit, which is a single protein target.

The Proteasome Macropain subunit is a protein complex that plays a crucial role in protein degradation and is involved in various cellular processes. It is a target for drug development, and QSAR models can be used to predict the activity of compounds on this target.

The dataset contains fifty-one compounds with their corresponding activity values and molecular fingerprints. The molecular fingerprints are represented as FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening to identify potential compounds that can interact with the Proteasome Macropain subunit. The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.
