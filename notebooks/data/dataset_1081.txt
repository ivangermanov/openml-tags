The RSCTC 2010 Five dataset is classified under Chemistry and Life Science, with a machine learning friendly format of less than eighty percent. This dataset is part of the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge, which provides example datasets for six different problems of DNA microarray data analysis and classification.

All datasets contain gene expression data characterized by values of attributes ranging from twenty thousand to sixty-five thousand. The samples are assigned to several classes, ranging from two to ten. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA microarrays.

This dataset is sourced from the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge, which provides datasets for DNA microarray data analysis and classification. The challenge provides datasets with varying numbers of attributes and classes.
