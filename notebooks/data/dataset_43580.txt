Nebraska Football Box Scores 1962-2020

Tags: Dataset includes date and time, opponent, score, rushing statistics, passing statistics, turnovers, Nebraska penalties, point spread, and weather information. All games are included.

Penalty data is incomplete before September 16, 1972, against Texas A&M. Point spread data is unknown before the 1978 season. It is listed for approximately eighty-nine games from that point forward. Weather data is taken from the DarkSky API and from Weather Underground. I have found temperature and humidity data to be fairly reliable, but wind data is less so.
