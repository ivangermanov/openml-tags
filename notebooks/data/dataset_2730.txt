This dataset consists of historical price data of the Forex aud/usd pair obtained from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a single candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not operational during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is defined as the direction of the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the subsequent minute relative to the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute takes on a value of true if the mean high price increases in the subsequent minute, and false if it decreases or remains unchanged.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only, and realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of close attributes, which are also available.
