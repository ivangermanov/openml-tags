QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Cyclin dependent kinase like, a single protein target. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and has several associated Gene Ontology classifications. These include cellular components such as nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and centrosome. Its molecular functions involve nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and transferase activity. Biological processes associated with this protein include protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, sex differentiation, and regulation of cell cycle.

The target protein is referenced in various databases including ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, GoProcess, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. These resources provide additional information on the protein's structure, function, and interactions.

This QSAR dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers studying drug interactions with Cyclin dependent kinase like and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic compounds targeting this protein.
