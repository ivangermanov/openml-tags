QSAR-TID-101309 Dataset 

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101309. The dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Folded Circular Fingerprint 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, released in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used in any research or publication.
