Image Segmentation Data Set

Tags: OpenML, study, uci

The instances for this dataset were randomly selected from a database containing seven outdoor images. Each image was manually segmented to create a classification for every pixel, with each instance representing a three by three region.

Attribute Information:
Region centroid column: the column of the center pixel of the region.
Region centroid row: the row of the center pixel of the region.
Region pixel count: the number of pixels in a region, which is always nine.
Short line density five: results from a line extraction algorithm counting low contrast lines of length five in any orientation passing through the region.
Short line density two: similar to short line density five but counts high contrast lines.
Vertical edge mean: measures contrast of horizontally adjacent pixels, used as a vertical edge detector.
Vertical edge standard deviation: related to vertical edge mean.
Horizontal edge mean: measures contrast of vertically adjacent pixels for horizontal line detection.
Horizontal edge standard deviation: related to horizontal edge mean.
Intensity mean: average of red, green, and blue values divided by three across the region.
Raw red mean: average red value in the region.
Raw blue mean: average blue value in the region.
Raw green mean: average green value in the region.
Excess red mean: measures excess red as twice red minus green plus blue.
Excess blue mean: measures excess blue as twice blue minus green plus red.
Excess green mean: measures excess green as twice green minus red plus blue.
Value mean: three dimensional nonlinear transformation of RGB.
Saturation mean: related to value mean.
Hue mean: also related to value mean.

The dataset does not contain any missing values. Each instance represents a small region from outdoor imagery, with various attributes describing color, contrast, and edge characteristics. These features are used to classify different segments of the images.
