Subsampling of the dataset Jannis with seed equals three arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals True. 

Generated with the following source code: 

A function subsample takes in self, seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and stratified as parameters. It returns a dataset. 

The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects the features and target from the dataset. 

If the number of unique classes in the target is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes to keep based on their frequency in the target. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the features and target accordingly. 

If the number of columns in the features is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns to keep. 

If the number of rows in the features is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly and samples the rows to keep. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a new dataset with the subsampled features, target, categorical mask, and columns.

Keywords: dataset subsampling, stratified sampling, feature selection, class selection, random sampling.
