This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Two Hundred Seventy Eight, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four one, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four two, and so on up to FCFP six one hundred twenty-four nine hundred ninety-eight.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen.

It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Adenosine A Two B Receptor, also known as Adora Two B.

Adenosine A Two B Receptor is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms include Adenosine Receptor A Two B and ADORA Two B.

It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and its protein target classification is One Point Membrane Receptor Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor Small Molecule Receptor Family A GPCR Nucleotide-Like Receptor Family A GPCR Adenosine Receptor.
