Diabetes Dataset

The Diabetes dataset contains ten baseline variables, including age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, which were obtained for each of the diabetes patients. Additionally, the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, was also recorded.

Data Set Characteristics:

This dataset consists of a total number of instances and a total number of attributes. The first ten columns are numeric predictive values, while the eleventh column is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Attribute Information:

The dataset includes information on various patient characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, and average blood pressure. Furthermore, it also includes six blood serum measurements, namely S One, S Two, S Three, S Four, S Five, and S Six.

Note: Each of these ten feature variables has been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the total number of samples. This means that the sum of squares of each column totals one.

Source:
The dataset was obtained from a reputable source, which provides detailed information about the dataset.
