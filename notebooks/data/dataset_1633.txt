This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Cell Division Cycle Two-Like Protein Kinase Six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September two thousand fifteen.

The target is Cell Division Cycle Two-Like Protein Kinase Six, also known as CDC Two L Six, CDC Two Related Protein Kinase Six, CDK Eleven, CDK Nineteen, Cell Division Cycle Two-Like Protein Kinase Six. It is an enzyme, a kinase, and a protein kinase belonging to the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase CDK family.

The target is involved in various biological processes including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, positive regulation of apoptotic process, regulation of cell cycle, and cellular response to lipopolysaccharide. It is located in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, mediator complex, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm.
