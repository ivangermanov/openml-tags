**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample 9.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education. The Barley Bayesian Network is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides".

The network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of one hundred fourteen thousand and five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

This Bayesian network is a representation of the relationships between various factors influencing the production of barley, including characteristics of the barley itself, environmental factors, and farming practices. The network is a complex system with many interconnected variables, making it a challenging but valuable tool for understanding and predicting the outcomes of different approaches to barley production.
