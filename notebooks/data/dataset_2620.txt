The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game. 

In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. 

In this case, there are four attributes that describe each instance: the general outlook, the temperature, the level of humidity, and whether it is windy. 

The outcome of these attributes is whether to play or not.
