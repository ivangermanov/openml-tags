QSAR-TID-11044 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Sixteen, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP Six One Two Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
