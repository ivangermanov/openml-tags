The Space GA Dataset, tagged with Chemistry and Physical Sciences, contains a comprehensive collection of three thousand one hundred seven observations on United States county votes cast in the nineteen eighty presidential election.

Given a range of demographic and socioeconomic factors, the ultimate goal is to accurately predict the number of votes per population, expressed as a logarithmic value. To achieve this, the dataset provides a wealth of information about each county, including its population, education levels, homeownership rates, income, and geographic coordinates.

The attribute description outlines the significance of each feature:

The logarithm of total number of votes divided by population serves as the target feature, providing a standardized measure of voter turnout. 

The population feature represents the total number of individuals eighteen years of age or older residing within each county.

The education feature captures the proportion of the population holding a twelfth-grade education or higher, serving as an indicator of educational attainment.

The number of owner-occupied housing units is represented by the houses feature, which may influence voter behavior and political affiliation.

The aggregate income feature provides insight into the economic well-being of each county's residents.

Finally, the x-coordinate and y-coordinate features specify the precise geographic location of each county.

Keywords: presidential election, voter turnout, demographics, socioeconomic factors, geographic coordinates, educational attainment, homeownership, income.
