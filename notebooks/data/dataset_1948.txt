This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Eleven Thousand One Hundred Forty-Nine, and it has one thousand five hundred twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and various FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September Two Thousand Fifteen.

This dataset is related to Rho-associated protein kinase Two, also known as Single Protein, which is a target type. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified under Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase DMPK family/AGC protein kinase ROCK subfamily.

Rho-associated protein kinase Two is involved in various biological processes, including mitotic cytokinesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, response to ischemia, aortic valve morphogenesis, smooth muscle contraction, organelle organization, signal transduction, and many others.

It is also associated with various diseases and disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.
