**Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample 5**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository provides access to this network, which is characterized by thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in a total of five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, while the average degree is two point six three. Additionally, the maximum in-degree is three.

This network is designed to model the influence diagram for management of mildew in winter wheat, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex relationships between various factors affecting mildew growth.

The network incorporates a range of features, including microclimate, leaf area index, photosynthesis, and precipitation, among others, to provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamics driving mildew development.
