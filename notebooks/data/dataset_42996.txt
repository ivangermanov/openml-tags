The Gender by Name Data Set 

This dataset attributes first names to genders, providing counts and probabilities. It combines open source government data from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. This dataset combines raw counts for first given names of male and female babies during specific time periods, and then calculates a probability for a name given the aggregate count.

The source datasets are from government authorities, including the Baby Names from Social Security Card Applications National Data, the Baby names in England and Wales Statistical bulletins, the British Columbia One Hundred Years of Popular Baby names, and the Popular Baby Names from the Attorney General's Department.
