This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dual Specificity Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Three, and it has multiple rows and numerous features.

The features represent Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identification, fingerprints, and median pseudo-pIC50.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The preferred name for this drug target is Dual Specificity Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Three, also known as Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Three, Map Two Kinase Three, and Map Kinase Kinase Three.

It is a single protein and an enzyme, specifically a protein kinase belonging to the Ste Seven family. It is involved in various biological processes, including the Mapk cascade, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and response to ischemia.

It is also associated with several cellular components, including the nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, and membrane.
