Subsampling of the dataset Guillermo 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Guillermo dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset while maintaining the overall characteristics of the original data.

The dataset was created using a random number generator with a specified seed value, ensuring reproducibility of the results. First, the classes were sampled uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes from the total unique classes present in the dataset. Then, the columns were sampled uniformly, choosing a specified number of columns from the total columns available.

Finally, the rows were sampled using a stratified approach, ensuring that the class distribution in the subsampled dataset remains similar to the original dataset. This involved concatenating the feature columns with the target column, performing a stratified split, and then separating the feature columns and target column again.

The resulting dataset consists of a specified number of rows, columns, and classes, with the categorical mask preserved for future reference.
