Tags: Subsampling of the dataset CNAE Nine

This dataset is a subsample of the original CNAE Nine dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset to a manageable size.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling the unique classes present in the dataset, with a maximum of ten classes selected. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to subset the data.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce the number of features. A maximum of one hundred columns were selected, and the dataset was subsetted to include only these columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce the number of samples. A maximum of two thousand rows were selected, and the dataset was subsetted to include only these rows. This sampling was done in a stratified manner to ensure that the class distribution was maintained.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features and samples, with the categorical columns converted to string format for compatibility with OpenML.
