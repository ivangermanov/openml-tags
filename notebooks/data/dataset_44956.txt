**Abalone Dataset**

**Data Description**
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements is a challenging task. The age of abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope, which is a time-consuming and laborious process. To simplify this process, other measurements that are easier to obtain are used to predict the age. Additionally, further information such as weather patterns and location, which affect food availability, may be required to solve this problem. The original data was preprocessed by removing examples with missing values, and the ranges of the continuous values were scaled for use with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) by dividing by two hundred.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset consists of nine attributes, which are:

* Sex: the sex of the abalone, which can be male, female, or infant
* Length: the longest shell measurement in millimeters
* Diameter: the measurement perpendicular to the length in millimeters
* Height: the height of the abalone with meat in the shell in millimeters
* Whole Weight: the whole abalone weight in grams
* Shucked Weight: the weight of the meat in grams
* Viscera Weight: the gut weight after bleeding in grams
* Shell Weight: the weight of the shell after being dried in grams
* Rings: the age of the abalone in years, which is the target feature

**Dataset Information**
The dataset does not contain any missing values. The age of the abalone, which is the number of rings, is the value to predict, either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.
