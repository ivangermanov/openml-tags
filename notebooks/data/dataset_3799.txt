The QSAR-TID-10939 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10939. This dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

The dataset contains information about the compound's molecular structure, including its chemical properties and binding affinity. The molecular fingerprints were generated using the FCFP six algorithm, which is a type of molecular fingerprinting method.

The dataset also includes information about the target protein, Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase Alpha Six, which is a single protein target. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and cell growth.
