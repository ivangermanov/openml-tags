The Hepar2 Bayesian Network is a machine learning model designed for medicine, specifically for diagnosis of liver disorders. This network repository reference is available online.

The network consists of seventy nodes connected by one hundred twenty-three arcs, resulting in a total of one thousand four hundred fifty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, while the average degree is around three point five one. The maximum in-degree of the network is six.

This network is characterized by its ability to model complex relationships between various medical features, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint issues, platelet count, very high ammonia levels, spider naevi, spleen health, age, jaundice, hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, chronic hepatitis, itching, steatosis, sex, injections, hepatitis B surface antigen, cirrhosis, palmar erythema, abdominal pain, hepatitis C antibody, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase, rheumatic heart disease, gallstones, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, primary biliary cirrhosis, alanine transaminase, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, aspartate transaminase, hepatitis B e antigen, skin health, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, hepatitis B core antibody, right upper quadrant pressure, alcohol consumption, lupus erythematosus cells, antimitochondrial antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites, hospitalization, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, density, blood transfusion, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, edge, edema, fatty liver, alcoholism, surgical history.
