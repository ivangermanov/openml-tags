Elevators
Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset is obtained from the task of controlling an F-16 aircraft, although the target variable and attributes are different from the ailerons domain. In this case, the goal variable is related to an action taken on the elevators of the aircraft. The dataset features variables such as climb rate, speed, pitch, yaw, current roll, absolute roll, and differences in climb rate and roll rate, among others. The dataset also includes variables related to time, such as time one, time two, time three, and time four, as well as differences in these time variables. The goal of the dataset is to predict the action taken on the elevators of the aircraft.
