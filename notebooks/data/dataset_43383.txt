Time series analysis deals with time series-based data to extract patterns for predictions and other characteristics of the data. It utilizes a model for forecasting future values in a small time frame based on previous observations. This type of analysis is widely used for non-stationary data, such as economic data, weather data, stock prices, and retail sales forecasting.

The Superstore Sales Dataset is easy to understand and is self-explanatory. It provides a comprehensive overview of a global superstore's sales data over a period of four years.

The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis and predict the sales of the next seven days from the last date of the training dataset. This involves analyzing the trends and patterns in the data to make informed predictions about future sales.

The dataset features a range of variables, including order information, customer details, product information, and sales data. By analyzing these variables, it is possible to identify key trends and patterns that can inform sales predictions.
