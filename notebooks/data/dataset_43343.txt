Mammographic Mass Data Set

Tags: Mammography is the most effective method for breast cancer screening available today. However, the low positive predictive value of breast biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to a significant number of unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. To reduce the high number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several computer-aided diagnosis systems have been proposed in recent years. These systems help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short-term follow-up examination instead.

This data set can be used to predict the severity, benign or malignant, of a mammographic mass lesion from Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System attributes and the patient's age. It contains a Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System assessment, the patient's age, and three Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System attributes together with the ground truth, the severity field, for a large number of benign and malignant masses that have been identified on full field digital mammograms collected at the Institute of Radiology of the University Erlangen-Nuremberg.

Each instance has an associated Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System assessment ranging from definitely benign to highly suggestive of malignancy assigned in a double-review process by physicians. Assuming that all cases with Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System assessments greater or equal to a given value are malignant and the other cases benign, sensitivities and associated specificities can be calculated. These can be an indication of how well a computer-aided diagnosis system performs compared to the radiologists.
