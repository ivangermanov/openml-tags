This dataset focuses on electricity usage patterns and is sourced from a comprehensive collection of statistical data. It was originally featured in the book "Smoothing Methods in Statistics," published by Springer-Verlag in New York. The dataset is designed to explore the relationship between various factors and electricity consumption.

Electricity usage serves as the primary class attribute in this dataset, allowing for analysis of consumption patterns. The dataset includes several features that may influence electricity usage, such as average temperature and month of the year. These variables provide valuable insights into the factors affecting energy consumption across different time periods and environmental conditions.

Researchers and statisticians can utilize this dataset to apply various smoothing techniques and statistical methods, enabling them to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in electricity usage. This information can be particularly useful for energy management, demand forecasting, and policy planning in the utilities sector.
