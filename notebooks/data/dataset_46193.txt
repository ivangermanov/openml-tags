This folder contains daily time series summary tables, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases for COVID-19 in the United States. All data is read in from the daily case report. The time series tables are subject to be updated if inaccuracies are identified in our historical data.

Two time series tables are for the United States confirmed cases and deaths, reported at the county level. They are named Time Series COVID-19 Confirmed US and Time Series COVID-19 Deaths US, respectively. Three time series tables are for the global confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Australia, Canada, and China are reported at the province or state level. Dependencies of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, and Denmark are listed under the province or state level. The United States and other countries are at the country level. The tables are renamed Time Series COVID-19 Confirmed Global, Time Series COVID-19 Deaths Global, and Time Series COVID-19 Recovered Global, respectively.

We have joined the confirmed and deaths datasets to create multivariate series. Preprocessing involved filling NaN values for FIPS with zero and for Admin Two with the value None. We then melted the datasets with identifiers, obtaining columns date and value, where value is for confirmed cases and one for deaths. We standardized the date to the format Year-Month-Day. We merged all the datasets, renamed the column UID to id series, and renamed other columns to covariate, with increasing values. We created a column time step with increasing values of the time step for the time series. We casted value columns to integer, defined id series and covariate columns as category, and casted other covariate columns to float or integer.

The dataset contains the following information: id series, covariate information, date, value for confirmed cases and deaths, and time step.
