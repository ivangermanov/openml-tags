QSAR-TID Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Protein kinase C epsilon, also known as nPKC epsilon, PKCE, PRKCE, or Protein kinase C epsilon type. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the AGC protein kinase group, specifically the AGC protein kinase PKC family and PKC eta subfamily. It is classified as an enzyme and kinase.

Protein kinase C epsilon is involved in various cellular processes, including MAPK cascade, macrophage activation in immune response, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and regulation of insulin secretion. It is found in multiple cellular components such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane.

The protein has numerous molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and enzyme activator activity. It participates in many biological processes, such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, lipid metabolic process regulation, and synaptic transmission.

Several databases provide information about this protein, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. The dataset also includes information on related compounds, their mechanisms of action, and development phases.

This QSAR dataset is valuable for studying the activity of compounds on Protein kinase C epsilon and can be used for developing predictive models in drug discovery and development.
