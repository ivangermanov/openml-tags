QSAR-TID-10878 Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10878. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is an identifier for each compound, while the median PXc50 represents the activity value of each compound. The FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of each compound.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The preferred name of the protein target is Protein Kinase C Epsilon, also known as nPKC-Epsilon, PKCE, or PRKCE. It belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and PKC family.

Protein Kinase C Epsilon is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, proliferation, and survival. It is involved in the regulation of multiple downstream targets, including other kinases, transcription factors, and cytoskeletal proteins.

The dataset provides information on the expression atlas, component, function, process, and other related aspects of Protein Kinase C Epsilon. It also includes data on the protein's interaction with other molecules, its role in different biological processes, and its involvement in various diseases.
