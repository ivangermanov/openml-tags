The Hailfinder Bayesian Network is a discrete large network repository that consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs. This network has two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters and an average Markov blanket size of three point five four. The average degree of this network is two point three six, with a maximum in-degree of four.

This network was developed for forecasting severe weather and has been used in various applications. It is a powerful tool for predicting hail storms and other severe weather events. The network takes into account various factors such as atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and moisture levels to make predictions about the likelihood of severe weather.

The Hailfinder Bayesian Network has been widely used and cited in research papers and articles. It is considered a benchmark network in the field of Bayesian networks and has been used as a reference point for many studies.
