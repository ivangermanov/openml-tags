Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Column One, Column Two, Column Three, Column Four, Binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on converting numerical data into binary classifications. The process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. This binarization technique allows for simplified analysis and potentially clearer insights into the underlying patterns within the data. The dataset maintains its original structure with multiple columns of information, but now includes a binary classification feature for enhanced study and analysis purposes.
