This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification results in a binary class feature where instances are labeled as either Positive or Negative.

The dataset consists of several features including column one, column two, column three, and column four. These features contribute to the classification of instances into their respective binary classes.
