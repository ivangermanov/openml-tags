Subsampling of the dataset Yeast with Seed Four 

This dataset was generated using a specific set of arguments, including the number of rows, number of columns, and number of classes. The goal was to create a subset of the original Yeast dataset, which contains One Eighty-One instances.

The function used to generate this dataset takes several parameters, including a seed value for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and whether or not to use stratification.

First, the function selects a subset of classes from the original dataset. If there are more than the maximum allowed classes, it uses a weighted random choice based on the frequency of each class.

Next, it selects the instances where one of these chosen classes is present and reduces the dataset to only those instances.

Then, if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, it uniformly samples columns to reduce the dimensionality.

Finally, if the number of instances still exceeds the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a representative subset of instances while maintaining the class balance.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features and the corresponding class labels.
