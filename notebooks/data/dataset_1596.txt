Covertype Dataset
Tags: concept drift, study

This dataset, known as the Covertype dataset, is designed for predicting forest cover type using only cartographic variables, without relying on remotely sensed data. The forest cover type for each observation, representing a 30 x 30 meter cell, was determined using US Forest Service Region Resource Information System data. Independent variables were derived from US Geological Survey and US Forest Service data.

The data is presented in raw form, without scaling, and includes binary columns (0 or 1) for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil types. The study area encompasses four wilderness areas within the Roosevelt National Forest in northern Colorado. These areas are characterized by minimal human disturbance, allowing the existing forest cover types to be primarily influenced by ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

The four wilderness areas included in the study are Neota, Rawah, Comanche Peak, and Cache la Poudre. Neota likely has the highest mean elevation among the four areas, while Cache la Poudre has the lowest. The primary tree species vary across these areas, with Neota predominantly featuring spruce/fir, Rawah and Comanche Peak having lodgepole pine as the primary species followed by spruce/fir and aspen, and Cache la Poudre containing Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and cottonwood/willow.

The dataset includes various attributes such as elevation, aspect, slope, horizontal and vertical distances to hydrology, distance to roadways, hillshade indices at different times of day, distance to fire points, wilderness area designations, soil type designations, and the forest cover type classification. These attributes are measured in different units, including meters, degrees, and indices.

The Covertype dataset has been used in several research papers comparing the accuracies of artificial neural networks and discriminant analysis in predicting forest cover types from cartographic variables. These studies have explored the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in forestry applications.

This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in forest ecology, environmental science, and machine learning applications in natural resource management. It offers a comprehensive set of features that can be used to develop and test predictive models for forest cover type classification.
