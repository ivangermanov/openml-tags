The Diamonds dataset is a classic collection of information about nearly fifty-four thousand diamonds. It is an excellent resource for those who are new to working with data analysis and visualization.

This dataset contains the prices and various attributes of these diamonds. The price of each diamond is listed in United States dollars. The carat weight of each diamond is also included, which ranges from a minimum of point two carats to a maximum of five point zero one carats.

In addition to these physical characteristics, the dataset also includes information about the quality of the cut, which can be classified as Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, or Ideal. The color of each diamond is also recorded, ranging from J, which is the worst, to D, which is the best. Furthermore, the clarity of each diamond is measured, with categories including I One, SI Two, SI One, VS Two, VS One, VVS Two, VVS One, and Internally Flawless, which is the best.

The dimensions of each diamond are also provided, including its length, width, and depth in millimeters. A calculated feature called depth percentage is also included, which represents the total depth of the diamond as a percentage. Another feature, table, represents the width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.
