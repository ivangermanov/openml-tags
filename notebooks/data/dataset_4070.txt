The QSAR-TID-100796 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100796. This dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September two thousand fifteen.

Scraped data includes information about the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase one A protein. This protein is also known as dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase one A, dual specificity YAK one-related kinase, Dyrk, and MNBH. It belongs to the species Mus musculus.

This protein is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CMGC protein kinase group, CMGC protein kinase DYRK family, and CMGC protein kinase Dyrk one subfamily.

It has been found to be expressed in various cellular components, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule, neurofilament, actin filament, nuclear speck, axon, dendrite, and ribonucleoprotein complex.

The protein has various functions, including nucleotide binding, transcription coactivator activity, actin binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, cytoskeletal protein binding, RNA polymerase two CTD heptapeptide repeat kinase activity, tubulin binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, identical protein binding, and protein self-association.

It is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, protein phosphorylation, circadian rhythm, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation, peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, negative regulation of microtubule polymerization, positive regulation of RNA splicing, amyloid-beta formation, peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation, negative regulation of DNA damage response, positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein autophosphorylation, negative regulation of mRNA splicing, and negative regulation of DNA methylation-dependent heterochromatin formation.
