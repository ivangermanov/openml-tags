Subsampling of the dataset Riccardo with seed equal to four, maximum number of rows equal to two thousand, maximum number of columns equal to one hundred, maximum number of classes equal to ten, and stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratify parameter determines whether the sampling should be stratified or not.

The function uses the train test split function from scikit learn to split the data into a subset and the rest. The subset is then returned as a new dataset.

Features: 

The dataset contains a variety of features, including V One Fifteen, V One Fifty, V Two Fifty Six, V Three Thirty Eight, V Three Forty, V Three Eighty Three, V Four Ninety Three, V Five Forty Nine, V Five Sixty Seven, V Five Eighty Nine, V Seven Zero Two, V Seven Thirty Three, V Seven Thirty Six, V Seven Fifty Three, V Seven Seventy, V Eight Seventeen, V Eight Fifty Five, V Eight Eighty Two, V Nine Twenty Six, V Nine Twenty Eight, V Nine Fifty, V Nine Fifty Three, and many more.
