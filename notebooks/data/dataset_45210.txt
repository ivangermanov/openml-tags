bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 

This dataset consists of a large Bayesian network with a significant number of nodes and arcs. It has a substantial number of parameters, with an average Markov blanket size and average degree. The maximum in-degree of the network is also notable.

The Andes Bayesian Network is a model for online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It is a complex network that represents the relationships between various variables in a problem-solving domain.

Features of this network include nodes representing student knowledge, problem-solving strategies, and learning outcomes. The network also includes nodes for various mathematical concepts, such as force, velocity, and acceleration.
