This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero one zero four five, and it has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically the study three subset. It is tagged with machine learning, manufacturing, MTL QSAR.

Scraped data includes information about the protein target, specifically serine threonine protein kinase Nek five, also known as never in mitosis A related kinase five or nimA related protein kinase five. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and has been classified as an enzyme kinase protein kinase other protein kinase group other protein kinase NEK family.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, protein kinase, MetaQSAR, machine learning, manufacturing.
