This dataset, named Beans, aims to distinguish seven different types of dry beans based on their characteristics, including form, shape, type, and structure, considering the market situation.

The dataset contains sixteen features extracted from images of thirteen thousand six hundred eleven grains of seven different registered dry bean varieties. These features include area, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, aspect ratio, eccentricity, convex area, equivalent diameter, extent, solidity, roundness, compactness, and four shape factors.

Area refers to the size of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries. Perimeter is defined as the length of a bean's border. Major axis length is the distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean. Minor axis length is the longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the major axis. Aspect ratio defines the relationship between major and minor axis lengths. Eccentricity is a measure of how elliptical a bean is. Convex area is the number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed. Equivalent diameter is the diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area. Extent is the ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area. Solidity, also known as convexity, is the ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans. Roundness is calculated using the formula four pi times area divided by perimeter squared. Compactness measures the roundness of an object by dividing equivalent diameter by major axis length.

The goal of this dataset is to develop a computer vision system that can distinguish between seven different registered varieties of dry beans based on their features.
