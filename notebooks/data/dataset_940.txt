The KDD Cup Dataset offers the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider, which is commonly referred to as churn.

Churn Rate, also sometimes called Attrition Rate, is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support. In its broadest sense, Churn Rate is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving into or out of a collection over a specific period of time. This concept is used in many contexts, but is most widely applied in business with respect to a contractual customer base, including mobile telephone networks and pay television operators. Additionally, the term is also used to refer to participant turnover in peer-to-peer networks.

The training set contains a substantial amount of data. The first predictive variables are numerical, while the latter predictive variables are categorical. The final target variable is binary, which means it has only two possible outcomes.

This dataset is tagged as belonging to the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, OpenML100, Study One Two Three, and Study One Four.
