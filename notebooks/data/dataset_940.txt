This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification system allows for easier analysis and comparison of the data.

The dataset features various parameters related to water treatment, including pH levels, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, and conductivity, among others. These parameters are measured at different stages of the water treatment process, including entry point, primary settler, secondary settler, and discharge point.

By analyzing these parameters, researchers and scientists can gain insights into the effectiveness of different water treatment methods and identify areas for improvement.
