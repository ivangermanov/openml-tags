Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original water treatment data. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

The dataset contains various features related to water treatment processes, including measurements of different parameters at various stages of the treatment process. These parameters include pH levels, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, conductivity, and sedimentation rates. The features are measured at different points in the treatment process, such as the input, primary settler output, and secondary settler output.

The binarization process allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem. This transformation enables researchers and data scientists to explore different analytical approaches and compare the performance of various machine learning models on the water treatment data.

By converting the continuous target variable into a binary classification problem, this dataset provides an opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of different classification techniques in predicting water treatment outcomes. It also facilitates the study of feature importance and the identification of key factors that influence the success of water treatment processes.
