The NYC Taxi Green December 2016 dataset is a machine learning and statistics dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. It belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset contains trip record data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, featuring TLC trips of the green line in December. The data was downloaded from the commission's website, which provides detailed descriptions of all variables in the dataset.

The target variable chosen for this dataset is Tip Amount. The Total Amount variable is excluded to prevent deterministic predictions. Date variables, including Pickup Datetime and Dropoff Datetime, are also excluded by default, but they can be used to compute additional time features if needed.

This version of the dataset only includes trips where the Payment Type is credit card, as tips are not included for most other payment types. Additionally, the Trip Distance and Fare Amount variables were removed to increase the importance of the categorical features Pickup Location ID and Dropoff Location ID.

Features include Passenger Count, Tolls Amount, Pickup Datetime Day, Pickup Datetime Hour, Pickup Datetime Minute, Dropoff Datetime Day, Dropoff Datetime Hour, and Dropoff Datetime Minute.
