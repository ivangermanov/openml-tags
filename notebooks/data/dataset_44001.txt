The NYC Taxi Green December 2016 dataset is used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. 

The original dataset includes trip record data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. The dataset includes trips of the green line in December. The data was downloaded from the commission's website. For a description of all variables in the dataset, please refer to the commission's homepage. 

The variable tip amount was chosen as the target variable. The variable total amount is ignored by default, otherwise the target could be predicted deterministically. The date variables pickup datetime and dropoff datetime, which are ignored by default, could be used to compute additional time features. 

In this version, we chose only trips with payment type credit card, as tips are not included for most other payment types. We also removed the variables trip distance and fare amount to increase the importance of the categorical features pickup location ID and dropoff location ID.

Features include passenger count, tolls amount, pickup datetime day, pickup datetime hour, pickup datetime minute, dropoff datetime day, dropoff datetime hour, dropoff datetime minute, and tip amount.
