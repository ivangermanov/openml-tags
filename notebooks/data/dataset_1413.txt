The QSAR-TID-30045 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 30045, with six hundred fifty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It is essential to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target protein is a single protein preferred named Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Seventeen A, also known as DAP Kinase-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Protein Kinase One, DRAK One, and STK Seventeen A. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens.

This protein is classified under enzyme kinase protein kinase CAMK protein kinase group CAMK protein kinase DAPK family. Its description is related to the nucleus, plasma membrane, and nuclear speck.

This protein has functions such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

It is involved in biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, positive regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of fibroblast apoptotic process, and regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process.
