Name: Pol Seed One Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Pol with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the dataset. It first samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it samples the columns uniformly, selecting a specified number of columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
