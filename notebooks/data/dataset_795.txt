Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Age, Civil, Can/US, Binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean, respectively. This binarization approach transforms the regression problem into a classification task, potentially simplifying analysis and interpretation of results. The dataset includes demographic information such as age and civil status, as well as geographical indicators like Canadian or US origin. Researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems, particularly those involving demographic factors, may find this dataset useful for their studies and analyses.
