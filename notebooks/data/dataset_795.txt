The TAE Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

Features include whether the teaching assistant is a native English speaker, course instructor, course type, semester type, and class size.
