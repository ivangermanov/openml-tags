The Sylvine dataset has been subsampled using a seed value of four with the following parameters: maximum number of rows set to two thousand, maximum number of columns set to one hundred, and maximum number of classes set to ten. The stratification option has been set to true.

This subsampling process involves uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset until the desired number of classes is reached. Then, the corresponding indices are used to select the relevant data points from both the feature matrix and the target vector. 

If necessary, uniform sampling is applied to the columns to reduce their number to the specified maximum. Finally, if the resulting dataset still contains more than the desired number of rows, stratified sampling is performed to ensure an even distribution of classes.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, including V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15, V16, V17, V18, V19, and V20, along with the corresponding class labels.
