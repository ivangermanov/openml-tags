Cacao Flavor Tags: Economics, Manufacturing Chocolate Bar Ratings

Expert ratings of over seventeen hundred chocolate bars have been compiled in this comprehensive database. Each chocolate is meticulously evaluated based on a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating in this database solely represents an experience with one bar from one batch, taking into account factors such as batch numbers, vintages, and review dates whenever possible.

This database is specifically focused on plain dark chocolate, with the primary goal of appreciating the rich flavors of the cacao when crafted into chocolate. The ratings do not take into consideration health benefits, social missions, or organic status. Instead, the emphasis lies squarely on the flavor profile of each chocolate.

When evaluating the flavor component, diversity, balance, intensity, and purity of flavors are all carefully considered. It is entirely possible for a straightforward single-note chocolate to receive a high rating, equivalent to a complex flavor profile that evolves and changes throughout the tasting experience. Factors such as genetics, terroir, post-harvest techniques, processing, and storage are all relevant considerations when assessing the flavor component.

Texture plays a significant role in the overall experience, and any texture-related issues can potentially impact the flavor. This aspect is a testament to the maker's vision, attention to detail, and level of proficiency.

The aftermelt, or the experience after the chocolate has melted, is also crucial in the evaluation process. High-quality chocolate will linger, leaving a long-lasting and enjoyable impression. As the aftermelt is the final sensation one experiences with the chocolate, it receives equal importance in the overall rating.

The overall opinion is a subjective assessment of whether the various components work harmoniously together, providing an opinion on the flavor development, character, and style. This is where each chocolate can typically be summarized by its most prominent impressions, which linger in one's memory.
