This collection includes datasets of one dimensional ultrasound raw radio frequency data, acquired from the biceps brachii muscles of a single healthy volunteer. The annotation was performed by labeling the first ten seconds of each dataset as belonging to a relaxed muscle state and the last ten seconds of each dataset as belonging to a fatigue muscle state. Each line of the file contains an A-Scan consisting of amplitude values, an annotation indicating whether this A-Scan belongs to a fatigue muscle state or not, a timestamp, the arm position from which the signals were obtained, the subject identification, the dataset identification, the subject's gender, and the chosen lifted weight.
