Wine Quality

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics

This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark.

The Wine Quality dataset was transformed in the same way as the tabular data benchmark.

Original Description:

The Wine Quality dataset was created using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests, such as pH values, and the output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between zero (very bad) and ten (very excellent).

Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed, including Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance.

The relative importance of the input variables was also measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure. The datasets can be viewed as either classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.

Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. It would also be interesting to test feature selection methods, as not all input variables may be relevant.

The datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physiochemical and sensory variables are available, without any data about grape types, wine brands, or wine selling prices.

Attribute Information:
The input variables are based on physiochemical tests, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, and sulphates. The output variable is based on sensory data and represents the quality of the wine, scored between zero and ten.
