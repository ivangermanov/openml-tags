Wine Quality

This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. The original dataset was created in 2009 and is related to the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, with two variants: red and white wine samples.

The inputs include objective tests, such as pH values, and the output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between zero (very bad) and ten (very excellent).

Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed, including mean absolute deviation and confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance.

The relative importances of the input variables were measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available, with no data about grape types, wine brand, or wine selling price.

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. It could also be interesting to test feature selection methods, as several of the attributes may be correlated.

The dataset has no missing attribute values. The input variables are based on physicochemical tests, and the output variable is based on sensory data.
