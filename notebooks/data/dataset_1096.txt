Faculty Salaries

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset provides information on the average salaries for professors at the top fifty universities of the Association of American Universities. The salaries of full, associate, and assistant professors at these universities are included.

The dataset contains fifty cases, each representing a university. The variables include the name of the university, whether it is part of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (also known as the Big Ten), and the average salaries for all professors, full professors, associate professors, and assistant professors.

The Committee on Institutional Cooperation includes eleven schools, namely the original ten Big Ten schools plus the University of Chicago. The average salaries are based on the assumption that the proportions of faculty in each rank are the same as those at Ohio State University.

The data was collected for the 1992-1993 academic year, although data from Clark University was unavailable and had to be substituted with 1991-1992 data.
