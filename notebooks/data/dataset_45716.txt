The Thermal Power Consumption Mars Express Sixty dataset captures the status of the spacecraft over four Martian years, sampled at six different time resolutions ranging from one minute to sixty minutes. Here, we present the dataset with a sixty-minute time resolution, while other time resolutions can be obtained through the provided link.

From a data analysis perspective, analyzing these data presents great challenges, even for the more sophisticated state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods. In particular, given the heterogeneity, complexity, and magnitude of the data, they can be employed in different scenarios and analyzed through the prism of a variety of machine learning tasks, such as multi-target regression, learning from data streams, anomaly detection, clustering, and more.

While analyzing the Mars Express telemetry data is critical for aiding very important decisions regarding the spacecraft's status, it can be used to extract novel knowledge and monitor the spacecraft's health, but also to benchmark artificial intelligence methods designed for a variety of tasks.

The dataset features include thermal power consumption measurements, such as panels, front, back, left, right, up, and down, as well as sums and decays of these measurements. Additionally, the dataset includes context data, such as spacecraft orientation, maintenance activities, and communication flags.
