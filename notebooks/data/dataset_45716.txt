The Thermal Power Consumption Mars Express Sixty dataset captures the status of the spacecraft over four Martian years, sampled at six different time resolutions ranging from one minute to sixty minutes. Here, we present the dataset with sixty-minute time resolution, while other time resolutions can be obtained.

From a data analysis perspective, analyzing these data presents great challenges - even for the most sophisticated state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods. In particular, given the heterogeneity, complexity, and magnitude of the data, they can be employed in different scenarios and analyzed through the prism of a variety of machine learning tasks, such as multi-target regression, learning from data streams, anomaly detection, and clustering.

While analyzing the Mars Express telemetry data is critical for aiding very important decisions regarding the spacecraft status, it can be used to extract novel knowledge and monitor the spacecraft's health, but also to benchmark artificial intelligence methods designed for a variety of tasks.

Features include panel values, front values, back values, left values, right values, up values, and down values, all measured in joules per square meter. Additionally, there are sum values and decay values for each direction, as well as various flags and modes related to communication, maintenance, and scientific experiments.
