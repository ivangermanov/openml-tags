Subsampling of the Micro Mass dataset with seed equals one arguments number rows max equals two thousand arguments number columns max equals one hundred arguments number classes max equals ten arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters such as seed, number rows max, number columns max, number classes max, and stratified. It uses numpy's default random generator to select classes uniformly. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, it selects a specified number of classes based on their frequency.

The function then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates the input data and labels accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, it selects a specified number of columns randomly.

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to ensure class balance. It concatenates the input data and labels, then uses train test split to get a stratified subset of the data. Finally, it returns a new dataset object with the updated data, labels, and categorical mask.

Features include various variables from the Micro Mass dataset.
