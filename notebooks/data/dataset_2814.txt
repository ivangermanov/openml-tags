FOREX Eur/Sgd Hourly High Dataset

Tags: Finance, Forex, Forex High, Forex Hour, Machine Learning, Text and Literature

This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex Eur/Sgd currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a one-hour candlestick, with the entire dataset spanning from January first to December thirteenth. Since the Forex market is closed on weekends, there are no entries for Saturday and Sunday.

The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the high bid and high ask prices in the following hour, relative to the mean of the high bid and high ask prices in the current hour. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean high price increases in the next hour, and false if it decreases or remains the same.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions. In real-world scenarios, trade strategies should be based on predictions of closing prices, which are also available in this dataset.
