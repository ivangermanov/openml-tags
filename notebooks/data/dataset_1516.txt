Robot Failures LP Dataset
Tags: mf less than, study

This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

The dataset focuses on failures in approach to grasp position. It is part of a larger collection that includes datasets on failures in transfer of parts, position of parts after transfer failures, failures in approach to ungrasp position, and failures in motion with parts.

To improve classification accuracy, several feature transformation strategies were developed and evaluated, based on statistical summary features and discrete Fourier transform. These strategies enabled an average improvement of accuracy.

The dataset contains numeric features, all integer-valued. Each feature represents a force or torque measured after failure detection. Failure instances are characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular intervals immediately after failure detection. The total observation window for each failure instance was milliseconds.

Examples in the dataset are described with a class label followed by the evolution of forces and torques in the observation window. There is a total of features, representing the progression of forces and torques over time.

This dataset is part of a broader study on robot learning at the task level, particularly in the assembly domain. The research explores integration and learning in supervision of flexible assembly systems, as well as feature transformation strategies for robot learning problems.

The dataset originates from research conducted at a university in Portugal. It has been used in several academic papers exploring robot learning, feature transformation, and supervision of assembly systems.
