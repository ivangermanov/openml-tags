Used Cars Dataset
Tags: Context

Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it is very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. A web scraper was built for a school project and later expanded upon to create this dataset, which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.

Content

This data is scraped periodically, and it contains most of the relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales, including columns such as price, condition, manufacturer, latitude and longitude, and eighteen other categories. For machine learning projects, consider feature engineering on location columns such as longitude and latitude. For previous listings, check older versions of the dataset. See the dataset's GitHub repository for more information.

Features

The dataset includes a wide range of features, including the vehicle's identification, URL, region, region URL, price, year, manufacturer, model, condition, number of cylinders, fuel type, odometer reading, title status, transmission type, vehicle identification number, drive type, size, type, paint color, image URL, description, county, state, latitude, longitude, and posting date.
