This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand forty-nine eight, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about cathepsin L, a single protein preferred name, also known as cathepsin L one, cathepsin L heavy chain, cathepsin L light chain, with synonyms such as CTSL. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, cysteine protease, cysteine protease CA clan, cysteine protease C one A family.

According to Expression Atlas, this protein is associated with various cellular components such as extracellular region, extracellular space, nucleus, lysosome, multivesicular body, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, membrane, apical plasma membrane, cytoplasmic vesicle, endolysosome lumen, chromaffin granule, lysosomal lumen, intracellular membrane-bound organelle, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, extracellular exosome, and endocytic vesicle lumen.

Furthermore, cathepsin L is involved in various biological processes such as adaptive immune response, proteolysis, immune response, positive regulation of peptidase activity, protein autoprocessing, fusion of virus membrane with host plasma membrane, receptor-mediated endocytosis of virus by host cell, antigen processing and presentation, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class two, collagen catabolic process, zymogen activation, enkephalin processing, fusion of virus membrane with host endosome membrane, CD four-positive, alpha-beta T cell lineage commitment, viral entry into host cell, proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process, elastin catabolic process, macrophage apoptotic process, cellular response to thyroid hormone stimulus, and positive regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway.
