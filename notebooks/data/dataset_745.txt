Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original auto price dataset. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset includes various automobile characteristics such as symboling, normalized losses, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine size, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, and binary class.

This dataset is particularly useful for studies related to automobile pricing and classification. It provides a simplified binary classification problem based on the original continuous price data. Researchers and data scientists can utilize this dataset for various analytical and predictive modeling tasks in the automotive domain.

The binarization process allows for easier interpretation of results in terms of above or below average pricing, which can be valuable for market analysis and decision-making in the automotive industry. This modified version of the dataset opens up opportunities for applying binary classification algorithms and comparing their performance against regression models on the original data.
