Title: Glass Identification Database

Sources:
Creator: Central Research Establishment Home Office Forensic Science Service Aldermaston, Reading, Berkshire
Donor: Diagnostic Products Corporation
Date: September, 1987

Past Usage:
Rule Induction in Forensic Science

General Results: nearest neighbor held its own with respect to the rule-based system

Relevant Information:
A comparison test was conducted of a rule-based system, BEAGLE, the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis. BEAGLE is a product available through VRS Consulting, Inc. in Marina Del Ray, CA. In determining whether the glass was a type of "float" glass or not, the following results were obtained (number of incorrect answers):

Type of Sample -- BEAGLE -- Nearest Neighbor -- Discriminant Analysis
Windows that were float processed -- 10 -- 12 -- 21
Windows that were not float processed -- 19 -- 16 -- 22

The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence if it is correctly identified!

Number of Instances: 214
Number of Attributes: 10 (including an Id number) plus the class attribute -- all attributes are continuously valued

Mg: Magnesium
Al: Aluminum
Si: Silicon
K: Potassium
Ca: Calcium
Ba: Barium
Fe: Iron
Type of glass: (class attribute)
- building windows float processed
- building windows non float processed
- vehicle windows float processed
- vehicle windows non float processed (none in this database)
- containers
- tableware
- headlamps
