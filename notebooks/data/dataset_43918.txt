Energy Efficiency

This dataset was obtained from the UCI Repository. The dataset was created to perform energy analysis using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the aforementioned characteristics to obtain seven hundred sixty-eight building shapes.

Data Set Information:
The dataset comprises seven hundred sixty-eight samples and eight features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

Attribute Information:
The dataset contains eight attributes or features and two responses or outcomes. The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. Specifically, the features are relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. The two responses are heating load and cooling load.
