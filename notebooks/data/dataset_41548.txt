Scene Tags: Multi-Label Dataset for Image Classification

The Scene dataset is a multi-label image classification task where each image is assigned multiple labels such as Beach, Mountain, Field, and Urban. This dataset features a wide range of attributes that describe the visual content of the images.

The dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of multi-label image classification models, which are capable of predicting multiple labels for a single image. The Scene dataset provides a challenging benchmark for these models, with a large number of labels and attributes that require accurate classification.

The attributes in the dataset are numerous and varied, covering a wide range of visual features and characteristics. While the exact names of the attributes are not easily readable, they are designed to capture the complexity and diversity of the images in the dataset.
