Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data Data Set

The data were collected as the SCITOS G robot navigates through a room following the wall in a clockwise direction for four rounds, using twenty-four ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its waist. The dataset consists of raw values from measurements of all twenty-four ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label. Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of nine samples per second.

The class labels are:
- Move Forward
- Slight Right Turn
- Sharp Right Turn
- Slight Left Turn

It is worth mentioning that the twenty-four ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step). The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes twenty-four ultrasound sensor readings, labeled US through US, positioned at various angles around the robot. The front sensor (US) is at a reference angle of degrees, with subsequent sensors positioned at degree intervals, both clockwise and counterclockwise, around the robot's circumference. The back sensor (US) is at a reference angle of degrees.

Relevant Papers:
A study on short-term memory mechanisms in neural network learning of robot navigation tasks was conducted, focusing on this dataset as a case study. The research was presented at the Latin American Robotics Symposium.

Features:
The features consist of twenty-four variables (V through V) representing the ultrasound sensor readings, along with a Class variable.
