MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-101348
Tags: Machine Learning, Medicine, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101348. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the molecule ChEMBL ID, as well as various fingerprint features. It also includes data on the median pXC fifty value for each compound.

The target protein is a serine-threonine protein kinase, also known as PRKX. It is a single protein and its preferred name is cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit PRKX. It has several synonyms, including PKX one and protein kinase PKX one.

The protein is found in humans and belongs to the enzyme-kinase-protein kinase-AGC protein kinase group-AGC protein kinase PKA family classification. It is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation, protein phosphorylation, and cell adhesion.

The protein has several functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine-threonine kinase activity, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

It is localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm, and is involved in various cellular components, including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm.
