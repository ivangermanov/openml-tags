The Wall Following Robot Navigation Data dataset is categorized under Chemistry, Life Science, OpenML-CC18, OpenML100, study_123, study_14, study_34, study_52, study_7, and study_98.

This dataset was collected as the SCITOS G5 robot navigated through a room following the wall in a clockwise direction for four rounds, using twenty-four ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its waist. The data consists of raw values of the measurements of all twenty-four ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label. Sensor readings were sampled at a rate of nine samples per second. The class labels are Move Forward, Slight Right Turn, Sharp Right Turn, and Slight Left Turn.

It is worth noting that the twenty-four ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows, one for each sampling time step. The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a nonlinearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the Multilayer Perceptron network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions.
