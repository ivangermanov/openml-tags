Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using uniform random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns in the dataset exceeds the specified maximum, it randomly selects the desired number of columns.

Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows. This ensures that the resulting dataset maintains the original distribution of the data.
