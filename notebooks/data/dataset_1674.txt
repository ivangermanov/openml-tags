QSAR-TID-11018 Dataset: 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11018. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
