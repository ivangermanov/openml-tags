The goal of this dataset, known as the US Presidential Election Speeches dataset, tagged as Context, is to provide an organized way to access the transcripts of speeches given by various United States politicians in the context of the presidential election. 

Transcripts have been collected from Rev.com, and some additional information, such as the location and type of speech, have been manually added to the dataset for further clarification.

This comprehensive dataset consists of several key columns, including the speaker, who delivered the speech; the title, which provides a brief description of the speech; the text, which includes the actual transcript of the speech; the location, which specifies the place or platform where the speech was given; and the type, which categorizes the speech into specific categories, such as campaign speeches, interviews, or debates.

We would like to extend our gratitude to those who have contributed to this project. 

We hope that this dataset inspires researchers to explore various aspects of the presidential election and its associated speeches, ultimately leading to new insights and discoveries.

Features included in this dataset are the speaker, title, text, date, location, and type of speech.
