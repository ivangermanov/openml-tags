QSAR-TID-100947 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Two, and it has a large number of rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and many more FCFP features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset.

The target protein is a Single Protein, also known as Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Two, and it is a Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE Twenty family/STE protein kinase KHS subfamily. It is involved in many biological processes, including immune system process, protein phosphorylation, vesicle targeting, immune response, JNK cascade, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, positive regulation of JUN kinase activity, innate immune response, and positive regulation of JNK cascade.

The protein is located in the Golgi membrane, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, membrane, and basolateral plasma membrane. It has many functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase activity, kinase activity, transferase activity, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase binding.
