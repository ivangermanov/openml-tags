Dataset: Fourclass

Tags: Dataset from the LIBSVM data repository

Source: Original - Date unknown

This dataset originates from the LIBSVM data repository and has been preprocessed to transform it into a two-class classification problem. The dataset is designed for building projectable classifiers of arbitrary complexity. It was originally presented at the International Conference on Pattern Recognition held in Vienna, Austria. The exact date of creation is unknown. Researchers utilizing this dataset are requested to cite the corresponding conference proceedings.

Preprocessing: The original dataset has been transformed into a two-class classification problem to simplify the task and make it more suitable for certain machine learning algorithms.

Features: The dataset includes two primary attributes, labeled as attribute one and attribute two. The class label serves as the target variable for classification tasks.
