This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Bradykinin B one receptor, also known as B one R or BDKRB one, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor group.

The Bradykinin B one receptor plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including inflammatory responses, signal transduction, and response to mechanical stimuli. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and has been linked to several biological functions, such as G protein-coupled receptor activity and bradykinin receptor activity.

The dataset contains numerous features, including molecule ChEMBL ID, median PXc50, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints. These features provide a detailed description of the molecules and their interactions with the Bradykinin B one receptor.
