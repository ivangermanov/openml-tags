Digital Colposcopy Hinselmann 

Tags: Images, Life Science 

The Digital Colposcopy Hinselmann dataset was acquired and annotated by professional physicians at Hospital Universitario de Caracas. The subjective judgments, which are the target variables, were originally done in an ordinal manner (poor, fair, good, excellent) and were later discretized into two classes (bad, good). 

Images were randomly sampled from the original colposcopic sequences, which are videos. The original images and the manual segmentations are included in the images directory. The dataset has three modalities, namely Hinselmann, Green, and Schiller.

The dataset does not have any missing values. It consists of sixty-two predictive attributes and seven target variables. 

Some of the predictive attributes include the areas of different parts of the cervix, such as the cervix area, os area, walls area, speculum area, and artifacts area. Other attributes include color information, such as the average and standard deviation of the red, green, and blue channels in the cervix and the entire image. There are also attributes related to the shape and size of the cervix, including the maximum area differences between the four cervix quadrants, the coverage of the cervix convex hull and bounding box, and the distance between the cervix center and the image center.

The target variables are the subjective assessments of six experts and the consensus among them.
