The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game.

In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. In this case, there are four attributes that describe the conditions under which one might choose to play or not play.

These attributes include the Outlook, which could be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy; the Temperature, which could be Hot, Mild, or Cool; the Humidity, which could be High, Normal, or Low; and Windy, which is either True or False. 

The outcome of these attributes is whether to Play or Not Play.
