QSAR-TID-10623 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10623. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10623. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. The dataset should be cited as MetaQSAR project - September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains information about the Serotonin four receptor, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is a G protein-coupled receptor and a small molecule receptor. It is also known as five-HT four and five-HT-four.

The Serotonin four receptor is found in the Rattus norvegicus species and is classified as a monoamine receptor. It is involved in signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in neurotransmitter receptor activity and serotonin receptor activity.

The dataset contains information about the gene ontology of the Serotonin four receptor, including its cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The cellular component includes cytoplasm, endosome, plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, and synapse. The molecular function includes G protein-coupled receptor activity, G protein-coupled serotonin receptor activity, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and serotonin receptor activity. The biological process includes signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and serotonin receptor activity.

The dataset also contains information about the cross references of the Serotonin four receptor, including canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, MICAD, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
