**Meta Album Fungi Dataset (Mini)**

The Meta Album Fungi dataset is created by sampling the Danish Fungi 2020 dataset, itself a sampling of the Atlas of Danish Fungi repository. This dataset is sourced by a group of citizen botanists, verified by their peers using a ranking of each person's reliability, and finally verified by experts working at the Atlas.

Of the one hundred twenty-eight classes in the original Danish Fungi 2020 dataset, the Meta Album Fungi dataset retains the twenty-five most populous classes, belonging to six genera, for a total of fifteen thousand one hundred twenty-two images, with a minimum of three hundred seventy-two and a maximum of one thousand two hundred twenty-one images per class. Each image contains a colored one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixel image of a fungus or a piece of a fungus from the corresponding class.

Because the initial data was of widely varying sizes, a significant portion of the images had to be cropped, which was implemented by taking the largest possible square with the center at the middle of the initial image. Then, each squared image was scaled to the one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight standard using the Inter Area anti-aliasing filter from OpenCV.
