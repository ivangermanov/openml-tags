Indoor Scenes is a challenging open problem in high-level vision, where most scene recognition models that excel in recognizing outdoor scenes struggle to perform well in the indoor domain. This is primarily due to the fact that certain indoor scenes, such as corridors, can be effectively characterized by their global spatial properties, whereas others, like bookstores, are better defined by the objects they contain.

To effectively address the issue of indoor scene recognition, a model is required that can leverage both local and global discriminative information. The Indoor Scenes database comprises a diverse range of sixty-seven distinct indoor categories, with each category featuring a minimum of one hundred images.

All images within the database are in JPEG format and are exclusively available for research purposes. The dataset includes the following attributes: filename and class name.

Keywords: Indoor scene recognition, high-level vision, local discriminative information, global discriminative information, object-based characterization, spatial properties.
