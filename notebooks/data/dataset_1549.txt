Dataset Title: AutoUniv Dataset data problem: autoUniv drift

Abstract: AutoUniv is an advanced data generator for classifications tasks. The aim is to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. Data can be generated in CSV, ARFF or C formats.

Source: AutoUniv was developed by a researcher. Email provided. AutoUniv website link provided.

Data Set Information: The user first creates a classification model and then generates classified examples from it. To create a model, the following are specified: the number of attributes (up to a large number) and their type (discrete or continuous), the number of classes (up to several), the complexity of the underlying rules and the noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have up to several thousand rules. Rare class models can be designed. A sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. AutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples; a user friendly statement of the classification rules in an 'if ... then' format; a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate.

Attribute Information: Attributes may be discrete with up to several values or continuous. A discrete attribute can be nominal with values or integer with values.

Relevant Papers: Several papers are cited discussing modeling example life cycle in online classification learning, the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift, and structure and majority classes in decision tree learning.

Features: The dataset contains numerous features labeled V through V, as well as a Class feature.
