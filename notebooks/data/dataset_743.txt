Sleuth Case Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset consists of several features including Formula Mass, Liquid Chromatography, Book Keeping, Sample Size, Atomic Gain, and Year Result, which have been classified into two classes, Positive and Negative, based on their target values.
