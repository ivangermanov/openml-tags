Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization technique allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression task.

The dataset includes several features labeled as "oz" followed by a number, suggesting they may represent measurements or observations. The final feature, "binary Class," likely represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process. This dataset appears to be part of a larger study or series of studies, as indicated by the multiple study-related tags associated with it.

Researchers utilizing this dataset should be aware of its transformed nature and cite it appropriately, acknowledging both the original source (if known) and the binarization process applied to create this version.
