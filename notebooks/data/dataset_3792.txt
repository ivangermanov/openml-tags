Heart Disease Dataset (Comprehensive)

Tags: Health, Medicine

Context:
Cardiovascular Diseases are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately thirty-two percent of all deaths worldwide. This group of disorders affects the heart and blood vessels, encompassing Coronary Heart Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease, Rheumatic Heart Disease, and other conditions. A staggering proportion of Cardiovascular Disease deaths are attributed to heart attacks and strokes, with a significant number occurring prematurely in individuals under seventy years of age.

We have curated this comprehensive dataset by combining multiple independent datasets, unified over eleven common features, making it the largest heart disease dataset available for research purposes. The five datasets utilized for its curation are:

* Cleveland Database
* Hungarian Database
* Switzerland Database
* Long Beach VA Database
* Statlog (Heart) Data Set

Acknowledgements:
The dataset is derived from three other research datasets employed in various research papers. A Nature article listing heart disease databases and popular datasets used in heart disease research is shared below.
