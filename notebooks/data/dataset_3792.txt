QSAR-TID-11638 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11638. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1180 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

The dataset is related to the Mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2, which is a single protein target. It is also known as Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, and it belongs to the protein kinase group, MAPK family, and ERK subfamily.

The Mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 is involved in various biological processes, including the MAPK cascade, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, chemotaxis, DNA damage response, cell cycle, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset can be used to study the relationship between the molecular structure of compounds and their activity on the Mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 target.
