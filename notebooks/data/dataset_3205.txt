QSAR-TID-11969 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11969. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information about the cAMP-dependent protein kinase alpha-catalytic subunit, which is a single protein preferred name with synonyms. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens.

The protein target classification description shows the relationship between the accession and the preferred name.

There are multiple rows per page, each containing information about the ChEMBL ID, relationship, and preferred name.

Expression Atlas and Go Component provide information about the cellular component, biological process, and molecular function.

Go Function and Go Process describe the functions and processes related to the protein, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, and protein serine/threonine kinase activity.

There are multiple pathways and interactions involved, including the regulation of heart rate, mRNA processing, and protein phosphorylation.

Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, and Pharos provide additional information about the protein.

Reactome describes the reactions and pathways involving the protein, including PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, PKA activation, and triglyceride catabolism.

Keywords: QSAR, TID, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, alpha-catalytic subunit, molecular fingerprints, protein phosphorylation, PKA activation, triglyceride catabolism.
