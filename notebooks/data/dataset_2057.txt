QSAR-TID-101131 Dataset

Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101131. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when used in any research or publication.
