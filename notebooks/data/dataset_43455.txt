Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a current data release that provides access to a vast amount of data on galaxies, stars, and quasars. This dataset is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license.

The table presented is the result of a query that joins two tables: PhotoObj, which contains photometric data, and SpecObj, which contains spectral data. The resulting table has sixteen variables and one additional variable, class, which can be predicted from the other sixteen variables.

The variables in the table include object identifier, J2000 right ascension, J2000 declination, and magnitudes in different bands such as u, g, r, i, and z. Additionally, the table includes run number, rerun number, camera column, field number, object identifier, class, final redshift, plate number, MJD of observation, and fiber ID.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey uses a four-color UVGR intermediate-band photometric system, which is discussed in a paper by Thuan and Gunn. The survey also employs a five-color wide-band CCD system, which is described in a paper by Fukugita et al.

The variables run, rerun, camcol, and field describe a field within an image taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A field is a part of the entire image corresponding to 2048 by 1489 pixels. A field can be identified by its run number, camera column, and field number.

The class variable identifies an object as either a galaxy, star, or quasar. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has created the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the universe ever made, with deep multi-color images of one-third of the sky and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects.

The data can be obtained using the SkyServer SQL Search with a specific command. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey collaboration is acknowledged for their work on this dataset.
