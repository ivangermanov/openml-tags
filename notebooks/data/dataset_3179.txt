QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values of compounds on drug target TID. The activity unit is pseudo pCI. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC values. Features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target protein is HM nicotinic acid GPCR, also known as GPR B, G protein coupled receptor B, G protein coupled receptor HM, G protein coupled receptor HMB, and HCA. It is a single protein found in Homo sapiens. The protein belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor subgroup of carboxylic acid receptors, classified as a hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor.

Gene Ontology annotations include:
Components: plasma membrane, membrane, cell junction
Functions: G protein coupled receptor activity, nicotinic acid receptor activity
Processes: signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway

The protein is associated with various databases including Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. It is involved in hydroxycarboxylic acid binding receptors and G alpha signaling events.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project. Users are requested to cite the source when using this data.
