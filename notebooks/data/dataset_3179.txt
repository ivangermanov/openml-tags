The QSAR-TID-100430 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100430. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The data is sourced from ChEMBL, a large-scale bioactivity database.

The drug target, also known as HM seventy-four nicotinic acid GPCR, is a single protein preferred name. It has multiple synonyms, including GPR one hundred nine B, G-protein coupled receptor one hundred nine B, and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor three.

This receptor is primarily involved in signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. It is located in the plasma membrane and cell junctions.

Keywords: QSAR, TID, MetaQSAR, ChEMBL, HM74, nicotinic acid GPCR, GPR109B, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor.
