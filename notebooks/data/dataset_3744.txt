Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is provided in a CSV file, offering a range of resources that can be utilized as inputs for model building. It comprises a collection of website URLs, each accompanied by fifteen website parameters and a class label that identifies whether the website is phishing or legitimate. Specifically, if a URL is deemed phished, it is assigned a label of zero, whereas legitimate URLs receive a label of one.

The dataset serves as a valuable input for project scoping, aiming to specify both the functional and non-functional requirements for the project. It encompasses a variety of features, including registration dates, expiration dates, update dates, domain count, URL length, digital count, special character count, hyphen count, slash counts, protocol types, protocol counts, and web traffic.
