GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating various quality metrics, including accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among others, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stemmed from the growing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a unified collection of microarray classification problems that could be utilized by diverse researchers. This approach enables the comparison of multiple classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly accessible Expression Project for Oncology repository maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of the Expression Project for Oncology and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and is subsequently released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions.

The availability of this information translates directly into tangible benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike. Although multiple sources of gene expression data are available, the decision to utilize data from the Expression Project for Oncology repository was made due to the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the uniformity of the microarray platform used for all samples, the availability of supplementary information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the accessibility of a substantial number of samples for diverse tumor types.
