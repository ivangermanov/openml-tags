QSAR-TID-100909 Tags: Health, Medicine, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100909, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The data was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating molecular fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target protein is a single protein known as Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Receptor R3, also referred to as Activin Receptor-Like Kinase One. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme kinase protein kinase TKL protein kinase group TKL protein kinase STKR family TKL protein kinase STKR Type One subfamily.

There are two parent molecules associated with this target: ASCRINVACUMAB, an antibody that inhibits Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Receptor R3, and PANULISIB, a small molecule that also inhibits Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Receptor R3.

The protein is expressed in various components, including plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, dendrite, neuronal cell body, and BMP receptor complex. Its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein serine threonine kinase activity, transforming growth factor beta receptor activity, and protein binding.

It is involved in numerous biological processes, including angiogenesis, response to hypoxia, in utero embryonic development, regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, lymphangiogenesis, blood vessel maturation, blood vessel remodeling, and heart development.
