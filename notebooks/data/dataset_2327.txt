QSAR-TID-101332 Dataset Tags: Government, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101332, and it has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset contains numerous features, including molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The QSAR data was taken from ChEMBL version seventeen.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

The data shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred one thousand three hundred thirty-two.
