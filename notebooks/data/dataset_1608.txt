QSAR-TID-10058 Tags: Machine Learning, Meteorology, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one thousand fifty-eight, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program dassault systemes biobia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and many others.

Scraped data includes information about the melanocortin receptor four, which is a single protein preferred name, also known as mc four r. It is a membrane receptor family a g protein coupled receptor peptide receptor family a gpcr short peptide receptor family a gpcr melanocortin receptor. 

It is classified under one membrane receptor family a g protein coupled receptor peptide receptor family a gpcr short peptide receptor family a gpcr melanocortin receptor description relationship accession melanocortin receptor four single protein p five six four five zero.

It is involved in various biological processes and functions, including g protein coupled receptor activity, melanocortin receptor activity, melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor activity, protein binding, peptide hormone binding, ubiquitin protein ligase binding, hormone binding, neuropeptide binding, diet induced thermogenesis, energy reserve metabolic process, signal transduction, g protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase activating g protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, feeding behavior, regulation of metabolic process, insulin secretion, response to insulin, positive regulation of bone resorption, regulation of feeding behavior, response to melanocyte stimulating hormone, negative regulation of feeding behavior, regulation of eating behavior, and regulation of grooming behavior.
