The EEG Eye State dataset is a collection of brain activity recordings obtained using an Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. This dataset is comprised of a single, uninterrupted EEG measurement taken over a period of time. The eye state, which refers to whether the eyes were open or closed, was determined through camera footage and subsequently added to the dataset.

All data points are presented in chronological order, with the earliest recorded values appearing at the top of the dataset. The fourteen features included in this dataset correspond to EEG measurements taken from various locations on the scalp, including the frontal, central, parietal, occipital, and temporal regions. 

This dataset is useful for researchers studying the relationship between brain activity and eye state, and may have applications in fields such as life science and chemistry.
