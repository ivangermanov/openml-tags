The QSAR-TID-236 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and falls under the categories of Earth Science and Machine Learning, specifically Multi-Task Learning QSAR.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 236. It consists of 411 rows and 1026 features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Since generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, all bits are generated.

The dataset includes molecule identifiers and molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the chemical structure of molecules. These molecular fingerprints are essential for predicting the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.
