EEG Eye State Dataset

Tags: brain, EEG, OpenML, study, time series, UCI

This dataset contains continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements collected using the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. The recording duration was one hundred and seventeen seconds. Eye state information was captured via camera during the EEG measurement and manually added to the dataset after analyzing video frames. A value of one indicates closed eyes, while zero represents open eyes. All data points are arranged chronologically, with the earliest measurement at the top of the dataset.

The dataset features correspond to fourteen EEG measurements from the headset, originally labeled with electrode positions. These measurements provide a comprehensive view of brain activity during the recording session. The eye state information allows for analysis of how brain activity patterns may differ between open and closed eye conditions.

This dataset originates from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository, contributed by Baden Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University in Stuttgart, Germany. Researchers using this dataset should cite the UCI Machine Learning Repository in accordance with their citation policy.

The EEG Eye State dataset offers valuable insights into brain activity patterns associated with different eye states, making it useful for various studies in neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning applications focused on brain computer interfaces or attention detection systems.
