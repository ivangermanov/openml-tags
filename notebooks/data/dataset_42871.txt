Iris Dataset with Partial Label Ranking Tags

This classic dataset is a small yet significant collection of data from the early days of classification methodology evaluation. It has been widely used in statistics and machine learning literature.

The instances in this dataset represent individual plants. The dataset contains three classes, each with fifty instances, where each class refers to a specific type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two, while the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

The predicted attribute is the class of the iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain. The dataset has been used extensively in the literature on classification methods.

The dataset does not have any missing values.
