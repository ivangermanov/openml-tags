QSAR-TID-168 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 168. The dataset has 412 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and shows the activity values of several compounds on the Serotonin 4 (5-HT4) receptor, a single protein target.

The Serotonin 4 (5-HT4) receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and regulation of appetite. The receptor is a target for several drugs, including clebopride, naronapride, felcisetrag, and prx-03140, which are agonists or partial agonists of the receptor.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Serotonin 4 (5-HT4) receptor. The data can be used to build QSAR models, which can help predict the activity of new compounds and identify potential leads for further development.
