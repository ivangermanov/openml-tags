The Jura dataset consists of measurements of concentrations of seven heavy metals, including cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc, recorded at various locations in the topsoil of a region of the Swiss Jura. In addition to the metal concentrations, the type of land use, such as forest, pasture, meadow, or tillage, and rock type, including argovian, kimmeridgian, sequanian, portlandian, and quaternary, were also recorded for each location. 

In a typical scenario, the goal is to predict the concentration of metals that are more expensive to measure, referred to as primary variables, using measurements of metals that are cheaper to sample, referred to as secondary variables. In this study, cadmium, copper, and lead are treated as target variables, while the remaining metals, along with land use type, rock type, and the coordinates of each location, are used as predictive features.
