The Jura dataset is a multivariate regression data set consisting of measurements of concentrations of seven heavy metals - namely cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc - recorded at three hundred fifty-nine locations in the topsoil of a region of the Swiss Jura. Additionally, the type of land use - categorized into forest, pasture, meadow, and tillage - and rock type - classified as argovian, kimmeridgian, sequanian, portlandian, and quaternary - were also recorded for each location.

In a typical scenario, researchers are interested in predicting the concentration of metals that are more expensive to measure, referred to as primary variables, using measurements of metals that are cheaper to sample, referred to as secondary variables. Specifically, in this study, cadmium, copper, and lead are treated as target variables, while the remaining metals, along with land use type, rock type, and the coordinates of each location, are used as predictive features.
