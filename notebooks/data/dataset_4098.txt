This dataset is part of the regression on categorical and numerical features benchmark. The Diamonds dataset is a classic collection of information about nearly fifty-four thousand diamonds, containing their prices and various attributes. It serves as an excellent resource for individuals who are new to working with data analysis and visualization.

The dataset includes details such as the price of each diamond in US dollars; its carat weight; the quality of the cut, which ranges from Fair to Ideal; the color of the diamond, graded from worst to best; the clarity of the diamond, measured by how clear it is; and its physical dimensions, including length, width, and depth in millimeters. Additionally, the dataset provides information about the total depth percentage and the width of the top of each diamond relative to its widest point.
