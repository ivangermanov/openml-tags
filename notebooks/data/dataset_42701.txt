Methane Dataset 
Tags: Language, Machine Learning 

Coal mining requires working in hazardous conditions. Miners in an underground coal mine can face several threats, such as methane explosions or rockbursts. To provide protection for people working underground, systems for active monitoring of production processes are typically used. One of their fundamental applications is screening dangerous gas concentrations, particularly methane, in order to prevent spontaneous explosions. Therefore, the ability to predict dangerous concentrations of gases in the nearest future can be even more important than monitoring the current sensor readings.

The dataset contains raw data collected at an underground coal mine. It consists of a timestamp and measurements collected each second. The considered task related to this dataset is to construct a model capable of predicting dangerous concentrations of methane at longwalls of a coal mine in a chosen time horizon. In case of a classification task, the model has to predict whether the methane concentration for three methane meters exceeds a chosen threshold within a chosen period of time. In case of a regression task, it is required to predict the value of methane concentration for the selected methane meters.
