**Meta Album Airplanes Dataset (Mini)**

The original Airplanes dataset comprises a vast collection of remote sensing images acquired from Google Earth satellite imagery, featuring twenty-one different types of aircraft from around thirty-six airports. All the images were meticulously labeled by specialists in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. Each class includes a varying number of images, ranging from two hundred thirty to eight hundred forty-six, where each image contains only one complete aircraft, and they have variable resolutions.

To preprocess this dataset, we carefully cropped the images from either side to make them square, and then we resized them into uniform dimensions of one hundred twenty-eight pixels by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
