This dataset consists of three types of entities: the specification of an automobile in terms of various characteristics, its assigned insurance risk rating, and its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the automobile is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuaries call this process "symboling". A value of plus three indicates that the auto is risky, minus three that it is probably quite safe. The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all automobiles within a particular size classification (two door small, station wagons, sports/specialty, etc.), and represents the average loss per car per year.

Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a "class" attribute. The dataset includes information on various car makes such as Alfa Romeo, Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Dodge, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mercury, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot, Plymouth, Porsche, Renault, Saab, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo.

Attributes include symboling, normalized losses, make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, and price.

The dataset contains both categorical and continuous variables. Categorical variables include fuel type (diesel, gas), aspiration (standard, turbo), number of doors (four, two), body style (hardtop, wagon, sedan, hatchback, convertible), drive wheels (four wheel drive, front wheel drive, rear wheel drive), engine location (front, rear), engine type, number of cylinders, and fuel system.

Continuous variables range from normalized losses (65 to 256), wheel base (86.6 to 120.9), length (141.1 to 208.1), width (60.3 to 72.3), height (47.8 to 59.8), curb weight (1488 to 4066), engine size (61 to 326), bore (2.54 to 3.94), stroke (2.07 to 4.17), compression ratio (7 to 23), horsepower (48 to 288), peak rpm (4150 to 6600), city mpg (13 to 49), highway mpg (16 to 54), and price (5118 to 45400).

This dataset has been used in past research for instance based prediction of real valued attributes in the field of computational intelligence.
