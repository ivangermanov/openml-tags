QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information on thrombin, a single protein target. Thrombin is also known as coagulation factor II, prothrombin, and activation peptide fragments. It is found in Homo sapiens and classified as a serine protease in the S1A subfamily. Thrombin plays important roles in blood coagulation, hemostasis, platelet activation, and other biological processes.

Several approved drugs target thrombin, including argatroban, dabigatran etexilate, and desirudin. These act as thrombin inhibitors and are used to treat or prevent blood clots. The dataset contains information on the mechanisms of action, approval status, and chemical properties of these and other thrombin-targeting compounds.

The data encompasses details on thrombin's cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes as annotated in Gene Ontology. This includes its localization in the extracellular region, plasma membrane, and exosomes, as well as its enzymatic activities like serine-type endopeptidase activity and roles in proteolysis, blood coagulation, and cell signaling pathways.

Additional information is provided on thrombin's protein structure, interactions, and relevance to diseases like congenital prothrombin deficiency. The dataset incorporates details from various bioinformatics resources including UniProt, InterPro, PDBe, and Reactome, offering a comprehensive view of thrombin's characteristics and importance as a drug target.
