This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thrombin, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains multiple compounds with their respective activity values on the Thrombin drug target.

The dataset provides information about the Thrombin protein, which is a single protein preferred name for the enzyme prothrombin. It is classified under the enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily.

Thrombin plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process and is involved in multiple biological processes including acute phase response, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cell population proliferation.

It is also involved in multiple molecular functions including lipopolysaccharide binding, endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, and protein binding.
