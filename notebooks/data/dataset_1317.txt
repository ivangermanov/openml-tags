The Neurokinin One Receptor is a single protein preferred name and also known as NK One R, NK-One Receptor, SPR, Substance-P Receptor. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR neurokinin receptor.

Description Relationship Accession Substance-P Receptor Single Protein P Two Five One Zero Three.

The Neurokinin One Receptor is involved in various biological processes such as aggressive behavior, positive regulation of leukocyte migration, angiotensin-mediated drinking behavior, inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and many others.

Some of the parent molecules include Netupitant, Vofopitant, Tradipitant, Aprepitant, Elinzanetant, and others. These molecules act as Neurokinin One Receptor antagonists and have different phases and approval status.
