**Colon Dataset** **Tags: Microarray**

This dataset is a collection of gene expression data from tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays. The analysis of this data revealed broad patterns of gene expression, which were identified through clustering analysis.

The dataset is a result of a study that aimed to identify genes that are differentially expressed between tumor and normal colon tissues. The study used oligonucleotide arrays to probe the gene expression profiles of these tissues, and the resulting data was analyzed using clustering techniques.

The clustering analysis revealed distinct patterns of gene expression between tumor and normal colon tissues, which can be used to identify genes that are involved in the development and progression of colon cancer.
