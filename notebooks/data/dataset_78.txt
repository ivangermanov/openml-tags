Name: BNG (mfeat fourier, nominal)
Tags: artificial, BNG
Features: [76 numerical attributes omitted for brevity]
Class: [class attribute]

This dataset is an artificially generated version of the mfeat fourier dataset, created using the BNG (Big Noise Generator) method. It contains a large number of instances with nominal and numerical attributes derived from Fourier coefficients. The dataset is designed for machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, particularly in the domain of character recognition. The features represent various mathematical properties extracted from character images, while the class attribute denotes the character category.
