This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12268. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The target is a single protein, specifically dipeptidyl peptidase two, also known as dipeptidyl aminopeptidase two, dipeptidyl peptidase seven, and other synonyms. It is an enzyme, a protease, and a serine protease, belonging to the serine protease SC clan and serine protease S twenty-eight family.

The dataset is related to the organism Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme, protease, serine protease, serine protease SC clan, and serine protease S twenty-eight family.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, dipeptidyl peptidase, molecular fingerprints,Pipeline Pilot, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.
