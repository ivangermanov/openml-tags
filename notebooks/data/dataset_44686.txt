Subsampling of the dataset Christine with seed equals three arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals True.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. If the number of classes in the original dataset is greater than the specified number of classes, it uses value counts to select the classes with the highest frequency. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset. If the number of columns in the original dataset is greater than the specified number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows in the original dataset is greater than the specified number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows.
