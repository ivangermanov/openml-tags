Elevators 
Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset is also obtained from the task of controlling an F Sixteen aircraft, although the target variable and attributes are different from the ailerons domain. In this case, the goal variable is related to an action taken on the elevators of the aircraft. The dataset features variables such as climb rate, acceleration, pitch, yaw, current roll, absolute roll, climb rate difference, roll rate difference, and differences in climb rate and roll rate over time. Additionally, it includes variables related to stick angle and time, as well as differences in stick angle over time. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to predict the action taken on the elevators of the aircraft.
