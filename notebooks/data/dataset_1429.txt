QSAR-TID-235 Dataset: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Statistics, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 235. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The features do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was published in September 2015.

Leukocyte Elastase is a single protein target, also known as Bone Marrow Serine Protease, ELA2, ELANE, Elastase-2, HLE, and others. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily.

The protein target classification is one enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily.

Leukocyte elastase is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, response to yeast, acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, leukocyte migration involved in inflammatory response, biosynthetic process of antibacterial peptides active against Gram-negative bacteria, proteolysis, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, phagocytosis, response to UV, extracellular matrix disassembly, protein catabolic process, response to lipopolysaccharide, negative regulation of chemokine production, negative regulation of interleukin-eight production, positive regulation of interleukin-eight production, defense response to bacterium, positive regulation of MAP kinase activity, positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, negative regulation of inflammatory response, positive regulation of immune response, defense response to fungus, leukocyte migration, negative regulation of chemotaxis, pyroptosis, neutrophil-mediated killing of Gram-negative bacterium, and neutrophil-mediated killing of fungus.
