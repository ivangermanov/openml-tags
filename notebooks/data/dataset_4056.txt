QSAR-TID-277 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Beta, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Beta. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Retinoid X Receptor Beta is a Single Protein and its Preferred Name is Retinoid X Receptor Beta. It is also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Two, Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-Beta, and Retinoid X Receptor Beta RXRB. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified as a Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Two.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it for research purposes.
