QSAR-TID-11402 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11402. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains information on the activity of compounds on the Furin protein, a single protein target.

Furin is a protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including proteolysis, protein processing, and viral life cycle. It is a serine-type endopeptidase that is involved in the cleavage of precursor proteins into their mature forms.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs and therapies targeting the Furin protein. The data can be used to build predictive models and identify potential compounds that can modulate the activity of Furin.
