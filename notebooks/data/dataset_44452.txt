Name: Subsample of the RL Dataset with Four Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the RL dataset with seed equal to four, maximum number of rows equal to two thousand, maximum number of columns equal to one hundred, maximum number of classes equal to ten, and stratification enabled

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset, and then selects the corresponding rows. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, it uniformly samples the columns. Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows.

The resulting dataset has ten classes and one hundred columns. The features include various variables, such as V One, V Five, V Six, V Eight, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, and V Twenty-Two, as well as the class label.
