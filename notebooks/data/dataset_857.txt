Dataset: bolts

Summary: This dataset contains information from an experiment examining the effects of machine adjustments on the time required to count bolts. The data were originally presented as the STATS Challenge.

A manufacturer of automotive accessories produces hardware such as nuts, bolts, washers, and screws for fastening accessories to vehicles. The hardware is automatically counted and packaged. The process involves bolts being placed in a large metal dish with a rotating bottom plate. This rotation forces the bolts to the outside of the dish and up a narrow ledge. Some bolts fall back into the dish due to vibration. The ledge spirals upward to a point where bolts drop into a pan on a conveyor belt, passing an electronic eye that counts them. When the preset number of bolts is reached, the rotation stops and the conveyor belt moves forward.

Several adjustments affect the machine's operation, including:
- Speed setting controlling the rotation speed of the bottom plate
- Total number of bolts to be counted
- Second speed setting used to change rotation speed for the last few bolts
- Number of bolts to be counted at the second speed
- Sensitivity of the electronic eye

The sensitivity setting ensures the correct number of bolts are counted, balancing customer satisfaction and cost efficiency. The measured response is the time in seconds it takes to count the desired number of bolts. For analysis purposes, the response is standardized to the time required to count twenty bolts.

The dataset includes forty combinations of settings, with the order in which data were collected also recorded. The goal is to analyze which adjustments have the greatest impact on counting time and how to optimize the machine for the shortest counting time. Researchers are also interested in identifying any unusual features in the data.
