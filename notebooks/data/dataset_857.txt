A manufacturer of automotive accessories provides hardware, such as nuts, bolts, washers, and screws, to fasten the accessory to the car or truck. The hardware is counted and packaged automatically. Specifically, bolts are dumped into a large metal dish. A plate that forms the bottom of the dish rotates counterclockwise, forcing the bolts to the outside of the dish and up along a narrow ledge. Due to the vibration of the dish caused by the spinning bottom plate, some bolts fall off the ledge and back into the dish. The ledge spirals up to a point where the bolts are allowed to drop into a pan on a conveyor belt. As a bolt drops, it passes by an electronic eye that counts it. When the electronic counter reaches the preset number of bolts, the rotation is stopped and the conveyor belt is moved forward.

There are several adjustments on the machine that affect its operation. These include a speed setting that controls the speed of rotation of the plate at the bottom of the dish, a total number of bolts to be counted, a second speed setting that is used to change the speed of rotation (usually slowing it down) for the last few bolts, the number of bolts to be counted at this second speed, and the sensitivity of the electronic eye. The sensitivity setting is designed to ensure that the correct number of bolts are counted. Too few bolts packaged cause customer complaints, while too many bolts packaged increase costs. 

For each run conducted in this experiment, the correct number of bolts was counted. From an engineering standpoint, if the correct number of bolts is counted, the sensitivity should not affect the time to count bolts. The measured response is the time, in seconds, it takes to count the desired number of bolts. In order to put times on an equal footing, the response to be analyzed is the time to count twenty bolts.

Below are the data for forty combinations of settings.

Data:

RUN | Speed Setting One | Total Number of Bolts | Speed Setting Two | Number of Bolts Two | Sensitivity | Time | Time to Count Twenty Bolts

Analyze the data. Which adjustments have the greatest effect on the time to count twenty bolts? How would you adjust the machine to get the shortest time to count twenty bolts? Are there any unusual features to the data?
