Please cite: Thyroid disease records supplied by the Garavan Institute and New South Wales Institute, Sydney, Australia.

The dataset contains records for hypothyroid, primary hypothyroid, compensated hypothyroid, secondary hypothyroid, and negative cases. It includes various attributes such as age, sex, medication status, medical history, and test results.

Classes include age (continuous), sex (male/female), thyroxine status, antithyroid medication, sickness, pregnancy, thyroid surgery history, iodine treatment, hypothyroid and hyperthyroid queries, lithium use, presence of goiter or tumor, hypopituitary condition, psychiatric status, and various thyroid function test measurements.

The dataset comprises multiple instances with numerous attributes, including both continuous and discrete variables. There are missing values present in the data.

The data originates from several databases from the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia. Each database contains training and test instances, with a significant amount of missing data. The attributes are either Boolean or continuously valued.

Additional databases related to hypothyroidism and sick euthyroid conditions are included, though there are concerns about potential corruption in these datasets. The format is similar to the other databases in the collection.

There is also a larger database covering multiple classes and a related domain theory. Another thyroid database with fewer classes, instances, and attributes is included, notable for having no missing values.

A separate thyroid database specifically suited for training artificial neural networks is provided, which includes cost data.

The dataset is designed for studying thyroid disorders and developing predictive models for diagnosis and classification of thyroid-related conditions.
