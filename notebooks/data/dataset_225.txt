The Puma8NH dataset family consists of synthetically generated datasets from a realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Unimation Puma 560 robot arm. This particular dataset family is comprised of eight datasets, although only two of them are included in this repository. All datasets in this family are variations of the same model, which is a realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Puma 560 robot arm. The primary task in these datasets is to predict the angular acceleration of one of the robot arm's links.

The input features include the angular positions, velocities, and torques of the robot arm. This dataset family was specifically designed for the Delve environment, with each dataset spanning the corners of a cube representing three key dimensions: the number of inputs, the degree of nonlinearity (ranging from fairly linear to nonlinear), and the amount of noise in the output (ranging from moderate to high).

This dataset has several characteristics, including a total of cases and nine continuous variables. The dataset is particularly useful for regression tasks.
