This is a family of datasets synthetically generated from a realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Unimation Puma robot arm. There are multiple datasets in this family, with variations on the same model simulating the dynamics of a Puma robot arm. The task in these datasets is to predict the angular acceleration of one of the robot arm's links. The inputs include angular positions, velocities, and torques of the robot arm.

The family has been specifically generated for the DELVE environment, with individual datasets spanning different dimensions representing the number of inputs, degree of non-linearity (fairly linear or non-linear), and amount of noise in the output (moderate or high).

The dataset originates from the DELVE repository of data and is part of a collection of regression datasets. It consists of numerous cases with continuous variables. The features include angular positions (theta), angular velocities (thetad), torques (tau), and angular acceleration (thetadd) for various joints of the robot arm.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying and predicting the dynamics of robotic arms, particularly the Puma model. It offers a range of scenarios with varying levels of complexity and noise, making it suitable for testing and comparing different regression algorithms and models in robotics and control systems research.
