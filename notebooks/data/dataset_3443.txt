QSAR-TID-11989 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11989. The dataset has forty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are useful for predicting the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The features in the dataset include Molecule ChEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each compound, and Median PXc50, which is a measure of the compound's activity on the drug target. The remaining features are FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are binary vectors that describe the molecular structure of each compound.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop predictive models for the activity of compounds on drug target TID: 11989. The data can be used to train machine learning models, such as random forests or neural networks, to predict the activity of new compounds on this drug target.
