The QSAR-TID-11989 dataset is a collection of QSAR data that shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11989. This dataset contains forty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset.

The drug target associated with this dataset is ADAM nine, also known as cellular disintegrin-related protein, disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein nine, or KIAA zero zero two one. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M twelve B subfamily.

ADAM nine is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis, cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway, and integrin-mediated signaling pathway. It is also associated with cellular components such as extracellular region, extracellular space, plasma membrane, focal adhesion, external side of plasma membrane, and basolateral plasma membrane.
