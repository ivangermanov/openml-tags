QSAR-TID-100418 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TEC, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TEC is a single protein, also known as PSCTK4, TEC, and Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Tec. It belongs to the protein kinase group and the tyrosine protein kinase Tec family. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including adaptive immune response, immune system process, protein phosphorylation, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, and regulation of platelet activation.

The protein is expressed in the cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and membrane. It has various functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, phospholipid binding, lipid binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein self-association.
