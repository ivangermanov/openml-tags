Subsampling of the dataset Helena with a random seed. This dataset was generated with the following source code.

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. The function first uniformly samples classes from the original dataset, then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. It then uniformly samples columns if required, and finally stratifies the data accordingly.

The resulting dataset has a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. The categorical columns are converted to string for OpenML.

Features: Twenty-seven variables, including class.
