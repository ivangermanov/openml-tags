QSAR-TID-30035 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30035. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30035. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate Fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for various purposes, including QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The drug target is a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is a type of enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.
