GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating diverse quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from an increasing demand within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a unified collection of microarray classification problems. This enables researchers to compare and contrast different classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

The origin of the data lies in the Expression Project for Oncology (expO), a large publicly available repository maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is subsequently updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions. This availability of information translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Several factors contributed to the decision to utilize data from the expO repository, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the availability of a large number of samples for different tumor types.

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, users are requested to acknowledge the assistance received by using this repository. This facilitates replication of experiments by other researchers. Users should cite the repository as follows:

Users are also encouraged to acknowledge the significant contribution of expO and the International Genomics Consortium for providing their gene expression samples to the public.
