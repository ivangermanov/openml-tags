Name: High-Level Synthesis for Machine Learning LHC Jets Half

Tags: Identify Jets of Particles from the Large Hadron Collider, created for the study of Ultra Low Latency Inference with High-Level Synthesis for Machine Learning.

This model is designed to identify jets of particles from the Large Hadron Collider, specifically created for the study of ultra-low latency inference with High-Level Synthesis for Machine Learning. It uses sixteen high-level features to identify the five jet classes: quark, gluon, W boson, Z boson, or top quark.

The High-Level Synthesis for Machine Learning paper provides more information on the methodology used.

The dataset used for this model is the LHC Jets Half dataset.

The features used to identify the jet classes include mass, multiplicity, and several other high-level features derived from the particle jets.
