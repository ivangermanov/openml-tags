QSAR-TID-101324 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Seven, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Seven. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Seven is a single protein target classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TKL protein kinase group, TKL protein kinase MLK family, and TKL protein kinase TAK1 subfamily. It is also known as TAK1, TGF-beta-activated kinase one, and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Seven.

The protein target is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, response to hypoxia, stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of T cell cytokine production, cytosolic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway, and MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in chromatin remodeling, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway.

The protein target has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, transcription coactivator binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase activity, MAP kinase kinase kinase activity, type II transforming growth factor beta receptor binding, protein binding, ATP binding, and receptor tyrosine kinase binding.
