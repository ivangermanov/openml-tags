While brainstorming ideas for a statistics project for a course, the concept of utilizing data about microbreweries emerged as a promising avenue of exploration. However, after delving deeper into the subject matter and giving it considerable thought, we ultimately decided to scrap the idea. Nevertheless, I am left with a valuable dataset that warrants sharing.

Data Acquisition 
The data was obtained from Beer Month Club, a reputable online platform, and encompasses information about breweries listed on their website as of a specific point in time. The dataset comprises a range of attributes, including the name of the brewery, its classification or type, physical address, official website, and state of operation.

Acknowledgments 
I would like to extend my gratitude to Beer Month Club for granting permission to scrape data from their Brewpub section.

Inspiration 
Although the dataset in isolation may not be particularly captivating, it has the potential to serve as a foundation for a more comprehensive analysis project. Such a project could incorporate additional variables, including Yelp reviews or the number of links redirecting to a brewery's website, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of the microbrewery landscape.
