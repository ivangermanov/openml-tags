Arsenic Female Lung Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

Originally, this conversion was done to facilitate easier analysis and interpretation of the data. The resulting dataset contains the following features: Group, Concentration, Age, At Risk Status, and Binary Class.
