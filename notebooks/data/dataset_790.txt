Elusage Dataset 

Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This process allows for a more simplified analysis of the data.

The dataset includes features such as Average Temperature and Month.
