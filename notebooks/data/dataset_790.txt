Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a binary classification. The conversion process involved calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean, respectively. Positive instances are labeled 'P' while negative instances are labeled 'N'.

The dataset includes features such as average temperature and month, which may be relevant to the classification task. The binarization process simplifies the original problem into a two-class prediction task, which can be useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning algorithms.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its binarized nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The original source and date of creation for this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper attribution and documentation in data science projects.
