Name: MiniBooNE Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset MiniBooNE, generated with a specific set of arguments and parameters.

This dataset is a subsample of the original MiniBooNE dataset, generated using a specific seed value and a set of parameters to control the sampling process. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset to create a smaller, more manageable dataset.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several arguments, including the seed value, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, as well as a flag to indicate whether to stratify the sampling process. The function uses the NumPy library to generate random numbers and perform the sampling.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including Particle ID features, which are not human-readable. The dataset also has a target variable, which is not specified.

The subsampling process was performed to create a smaller dataset that is more suitable for analysis and modeling. The resulting dataset has a specific structure and composition, with a certain number of rows, columns, and classes.
