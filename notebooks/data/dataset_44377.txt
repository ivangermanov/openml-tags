Name: Cover Type Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type with seed equal to zero, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals false. 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters such as seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and stratified, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes from the unique classes in the dataset. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. 

If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns and subsets the data. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to subset the data. Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a dataset with the subsetted data.
