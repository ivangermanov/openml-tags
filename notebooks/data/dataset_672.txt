Fri C4 One Hundred Dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This dataset belongs to the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty One, and Study Eighty Eight.

Features of this dataset include various ozone-related parameters, which are essential for understanding chemical reactions and life sciences. The dataset has been modified to facilitate easier analysis and interpretation by converting the target feature into a binary classification system. This allows researchers to categorize instances as either Positive or Negative based on their target values relative to the computed mean.
