Median house prices for California districts were derived from the census data. The dataset contains information about various features including geographical location specified by Longitude and Latitude, age of the houses, number of rooms and bedrooms available, population density, number of households and their income levels, which ultimately affect the Median House Value. The proximity of the district to the Ocean also plays a crucial role in determining the house prices.
