QSAR-TID-10004 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10004. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10004. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Carboxypeptidase N, catalytic subunit, which is a single protein preferred name. The synonyms for this protein include Anaphylatoxin inactivator, Arginine carboxypeptidase, Carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain, and Carboxypeptidase N polypeptide one. The protein is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MC clan, and metallo protease M14B subfamily.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the protein in different tissues and cells, as well as its function and process. The protein is involved in proteolysis, peptide metabolic process, bradykinin catabolic process, protein processing, protein catabolic process, and response to glucocorticoid.
