QSAR-TID-11149 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11149. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1521 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

Rho-associated protein kinase 2 is a single protein target, also known as KIAA0619, p164 ROCK-2, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 2, and Rho-associated protein kinase 2. It is a protein target classification of 1. Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase DMPK family/AGC protein kinase ROCK subfamily.

The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is No. The protein target classification is 1. Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase DMPK family/AGC protein kinase ROCK subfamily.

Rho-associated protein kinase 2 is involved in various biological processes, including mitotic cytokinesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, response to ischemia, aortic valve morphogenesis, protein phosphorylation, smooth muscle contraction, organelle organization, signal transduction, and Rho protein signal transduction.
