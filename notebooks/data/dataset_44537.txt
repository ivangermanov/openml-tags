Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset. It takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes in the dataset. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, it checks if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed. If so, it randomly selects a subset of columns. Otherwise, it uses all columns.

Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it stratifies the data accordingly and selects a random subset of rows.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
