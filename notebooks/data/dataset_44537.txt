Machine Learning and Statistics Subsampling of the dataset Dionis with Seed Four 

This dataset has been generated through subsampling of the original Dionis dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly selecting classes and columns to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The subsampling function takes several parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a flag indicating whether stratification should be applied. 

In this case, the seed value is four, and the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes have been set to two thousand, one hundred, and ten, respectively. Additionally, stratification has been applied during the sampling process.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, which include various variables denoted by V one through sixty, followed by the class label.
