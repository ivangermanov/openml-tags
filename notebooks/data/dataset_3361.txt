QSAR-TID-103071 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103071. The dataset has 150 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103071. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits.

The dataset has 150 rows, each representing a different compound, and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50. The Molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each compound, and the Median PX50 is a measure of the compound's activity.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR data. The project is a collaboration between several institutions and provides a platform for researchers to share and access QSAR data.

The dataset is related to the Bombesin receptor subtype-3, which is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is involved in signal transduction pathways.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and drug design. The data can be used to develop predictive models of compound activity, which can be used to identify potential drug candidates.
