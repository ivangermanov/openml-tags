The QSAR-TID-103071 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various biological targets. This particular dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 103071.

The dataset consists of one hundred fifty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule ChEMBL IDs and class features. The features represent extended connectivity fingerprints (FCFP) six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL IDs and median pXC50 values.

The target protein, bombesin receptor subtype-three, belongs to the family A G-protein coupled receptor and is involved in signal transduction pathways. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in neuronal cell body function.

This protein is also known as bombesin receptor subtype three, Brs3, and BRS-three, and is associated with several gene ontology terms, including plasma membrane, membrane, neuronal cell body, G-protein coupled receptor activity, bombesin receptor activity, neuropeptide receptor activity, and G-protein coupled peptide receptor activity.
