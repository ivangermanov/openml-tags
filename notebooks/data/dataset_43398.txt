Heart Disease Tags: Context

This database contains a vast array of attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of the most relevant ones. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been extensively used by machine learning researchers to date. The "goal" field is a crucial indicator that refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient, with a range of values from zero, indicating no presence, to four.

Inspiration
Experiments with the Cleveland database have primarily focused on distinguishing the presence of heart disease from its absence. However, there is still much to be explored in this dataset. Can you uncover any other trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health?

Features
The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, old peak, slope, number of major vessels, and thalassemia.
