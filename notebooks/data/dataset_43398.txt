Heart Disease Database

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This database contains a vast array of attributes, but most published experiments have focused on utilizing a subset of fourteen of these attributes. Specifically, the Cleveland database has been the primary choice for machine learning researchers thus far.

The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in patients, which is denoted by an integer value ranging from zero, indicating no presence, to four.

Inspiration

Experiments conducted on the Cleveland database have primarily aimed to differentiate between the presence and absence of heart disease. However, there may be other underlying trends and patterns in heart data that could be leveraged to predict specific cardiovascular events or identify clear indicators of heart health. 

Features: 
age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar levels, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and a measure of heart pumping efficiency.
