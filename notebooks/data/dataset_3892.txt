QSAR-TID-10453 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10453. The dataset has thirty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10453. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Dopamine D1 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as D(1) dopamine receptor and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the Dopamine D1 receptor, and can be used for various applications such as virtual screening, lead optimization, and drug design.
