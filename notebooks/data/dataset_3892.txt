International Football Results 

Tags: Machine Learning, Manufacturing Context 

Well, what happened was that I was searching for an easily accessible and readable list of international football matches, but unfortunately, I couldn't find anything decent. Therefore, I decided to take matters into my own hands and collect the data for my personal use. Since I've gone through the trouble of collecting it, I might as well share it with others.

Content 

This dataset includes a comprehensive collection of results from international football matches, starting from the very first official match to recent ones. The matches range from the prestigious FIFA World Cup to the lesser-known FIFI Wild Cup, as well as regular friendly matches. It's worth noting that the matches are strictly men's full internationals, and the data does not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation's B-team, U-23, or a league select team.

The dataset includes a csv file, results.csv, which contains the following columns: 
date of the match 
the name of the home team 
the name of the away team 
full-time home team score, including extra time, but excluding penalty shootouts 
full-time away team score, including extra time, but excluding penalty shootouts 
the name of the tournament 
the name of the city or town or administrative unit where the match was played 
the name of the country where the match was played 
a TRUE or FALSE column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral venue 

Note on Team and Country Names 

For home and away teams, the current name of the team has been used. For instance, when in the late nineteenth century a team that referred to itself as Ireland played against England, in this dataset, it is referred to as Northern Ireland because the current team of Northern Ireland is the successor of the late nineteenth-century Ireland team. This approach makes it easier to track the history and statistics of teams. 

For country names, the name of the country at the time of the match is used. So, when Ghana played in Accra, Gold Coast, in the nineteen fifties, even though the names of the home team and the country do not match, it was a home match for Ghana. This is indicated by the neutral column, which says FALSE for those matches, implying that it was not at a neutral venue.

Acknowledgments 

The data is gathered from multiple reliable sources, including but not limited to Wikipedia, fifa.com, rsssf.com, and individual football associations' websites.

Inspiration 

Some potential directions to explore when analyzing the data include:

Which team is the greatest of all time?
Which teams dominated different eras of football?
What trends have emerged in international football over the years – home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams' strength, and so on?
Can we draw any conclusions about geopolitics from football fixtures – how has the number of countries changed, which teams prefer to play each other?
Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in?
How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament improve a country's chances in the tournament?
Which teams are the most active in playing friendlies and friendly tournaments – does it benefit or harm them?
