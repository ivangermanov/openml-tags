The QSAR-TID-100621 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100621. This dataset has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project focuses on creating a large collection of QSAR datasets, each containing activity values of compounds against specific drug targets.

The dataset includes various features, such as molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the chemical structure of molecules. These features are essential for QSAR modeling, as they allow researchers to identify relationships between the chemical structure of compounds and their biological activities.

The drug target TID: 100621 is a proteasome macropain subunit, also known as PRE2. It is an enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and antigen presentation. Inhibitors of this enzyme have potential therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer treatment.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, and Reactome. It provides a wealth of information about the drug target and its inhibitors, including their chemical structures, activity values, and biochemical pathways.
