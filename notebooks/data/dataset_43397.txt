Airlines Tweets Sentiments Tags: Context

This dataset was created to classify tweets about an airline company. The tweets were manually classified as positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset consists of four columns: Tweet ID, which is a unique identifier for each tweet; Tweet Text, which contains the actual text of the tweet; Tweet Language, which is always English since all tweets are in English; and Tweet Sentiment Value, which is a numerical value indicating the sentiment of the tweet, with zero representing negative, one representing neutral, and two representing positive.

The aim of this dataset is to enable the determination of whether a tweet is positive or negative about an airline company.
