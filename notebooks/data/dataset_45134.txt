The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online. This network consists of twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three, and the average degree is two point five. The maximum in-degree is two.

This Bayesian network is a representation of a child's health, incorporating various factors that influence their well-being. The network takes into account the child's age, medical history, and symptoms to provide a comprehensive understanding of their health.

The network is a valuable tool for medical professionals, allowing them to analyze the relationships between different health factors and make informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment.
