Volcanoes on Venus - JARtool Experiment Data Set 

The data was collected by the Magellan spacecraft over a four-year period from nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety-four. The primary objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using Synthetic Aperture Radar. This type of radar provides high-resolution images of the planet's surface. A more detailed discussion of the mission and its objectives is available at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Magellan webpage.

There are some spatial dependencies inherent in the data. For instance, background patches from within a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images. In addition to the images themselves, there are ground truth files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. It is essential to note that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set, as no human expert has physically visited Venus, and the image quality does not permit one hundred percent, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by human experts.

The ground truth files include labels that provide some measure of subjective uncertainty. These labels range from one, indicating definite volcanic activity, to four, indicating only a pit is visible. This labeling uncertainty problem is discussed in further detail in relevant literature.

The images themselves are one thousand twenty-four by one thousand twenty-four pixels. The pixel values fall within the range from zero to two hundred fifty-five. The pixel value is directly related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a given spatial location. Higher pixel values indicate greater backscatter, while lower pixel values indicate lesser backscatter. Both topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength affect the amount of backscatter.

Relevant papers discussing the Magellan mission and its findings have been published in various scientific journals.
