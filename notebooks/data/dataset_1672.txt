QSAR-TID-104260 Dataset Information 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 104260. The data was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. 

The dataset consists of seventy-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.
