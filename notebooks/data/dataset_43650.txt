Spike Waveforms

Tags: Introduction

Neurons in the brain use electrical signals for communication. Different spike waveforms correspond to different cell types or different neuron morphologies. In learning about different spike waveforms, we may identify different neuronal types in our sample.

Content

The data contains numerical categories corresponding to the sampling of a five-millisecond extracellular voltage at thirty kilohertz. Since the extracellular voltage amplitude is related to the squared of the distance to the cell, we normalize the whole trace to the minimal voltage that corresponds to the peak of the spike.

To load it in Python:

import pandas as pd
waveforms = pd.read_csv('waveforms.csv', index_col = 'unique identifier')
waveforms.info()
waveforms.iloc[0, :-1].plot()

This will plot the first waveform. The last column is organoid.

Features: unique identifier, organoid

Keywords: spike waveforms, neuron communication, electrical signals, cell types, neuron morphologies
