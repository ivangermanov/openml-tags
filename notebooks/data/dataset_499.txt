The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets. These datasets originate from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded in a specific format, which includes information about colinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

The Friedman function is a widely used method for generating data, which includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output. A normalized noise is added to the output. The function itself is complex, involving sinusoidal and quadratic terms. 

To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. Furthermore, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity. 

Colinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features. The generated Friedman datasets have varying parameters, including the number of features, sample sizes, and colinearity degrees. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output. The remaining features are randomly generated. Sample sizes vary from one hundred to one thousand. There are five different colinearity degrees, ranging from zero to four. 

For datasets with a high colinearity degree, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets have fewer features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.
