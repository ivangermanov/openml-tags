The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12114. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase F (LAR) target, which is a single protein target.

The Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase F (LAR) target is a protein phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cell migration, and neuronal development. It is a transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that is involved in the regulation of neuron projection development and axon regeneration.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase F (LAR) target.
