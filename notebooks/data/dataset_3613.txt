QSAR-TID-10505 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10505. The dataset has sixty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10505. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 10505, which is a carboxypeptidase A1 enzyme.

Carboxypeptidase A1 is a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, leukotriene metabolic process, response to cadmium ion, and proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process. It is a metalloprotease that belongs to the M14A subfamily and has peptidase activity, metallocarboxypeptidase activity, protein binding, and zinc ion binding.
