Census (Augmented)

This data was extracted from the Census Bureau database by utilizing specific conditions to ensure a set of reasonably clean records. The prediction task is to determine whether an individual's annual income exceeds fifty thousand dollars.

Description of Final Weight:
The weights on the Current Population Survey files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian non-institutional population of the United States. These estimates are prepared monthly by the Population Division at the Census Bureau. Three sets of controls are employed, which include:

* A single-cell estimate of the population sixteen years old and above for each state.
* Controls for Hispanic origin by age and sex.
* Controls by race, age, and sex.

These controls are utilized in the weighting program, which undergoes six iterations to ensure accuracy. By the end of the process, all controls are revisited. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from the Current Population Survey by creating weighted tallies of specified socioeconomic characteristics of the population. Individuals with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. However, it is essential to note that since the Current Population Survey sample comprises fifty-one state samples, each with its unique probability of selection, this statement only applies within states.
