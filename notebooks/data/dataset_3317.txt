The Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees Data Set is a valuable resource for the garment industry, which is a prime example of industrial globalization in today's modern era. As a highly labor-intensive industry with numerous manual processes, satisfying the massive global demand for garment products largely depends on the production and delivery performance of employees in garment manufacturing companies. Therefore, it is highly desirable among decision-makers in the garment industry to track, analyze, and predict the productivity performance of working teams in their factories.

This data set can be utilized for regression purposes by predicting the productivity range from zero to one or for classification purposes by transforming the productivity range into different classes. The data set comprises essential attributes of the garment manufacturing process and employee productivity, which have been collected manually and validated by industry experts.

The attributes include the date in month-day-year format, the day of the week, a portion of the month divided into four quarters, associated department, associated team number, number of workers in each team, number of style changes in a particular product, targeted productivity set by the authority for each team per day, standard minute value, work in progress including unfinished items, overtime in minutes, financial incentives in Bangladeshi Taka, idle time due to production interruptions, number of idle workers, and actual percentage of productivity delivered by workers ranging from zero to one.

The garment industry is a significant sector that relies heavily on manual labor and has numerous manual processes. To meet the massive global demand for garment products, it is crucial to optimize the production and delivery performance of employees in garment manufacturing companies. Predicting the productivity performance of working teams can significantly enhance the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the industry.
