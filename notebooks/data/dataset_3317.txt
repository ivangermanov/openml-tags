QSAR-TID-100976 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100976. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100976. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The drug target is PITSLRE serine/threonine-protein kinase CDC2L2, also known as CDC2L3, CDK11A, Cell division cycle two-like protein kinase two, and Cell division protein kinase eleven A. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase CDK family/CMGC protein kinase PITSLRE subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including mitotic cell cycle, regulation of cell growth, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, cell cycle, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, phosphorylation, regulation of apoptotic process, regulation of RNA splicing, regulation of centrosome cycle, and regulation of mRNA processing.
