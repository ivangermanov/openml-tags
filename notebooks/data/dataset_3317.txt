The QSAR-TID-100976 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100976. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited when used.

This dataset shows activity values in units of pseudo-pCI50 of several compounds on drug target PITSLRE Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase CDC2L2. The target is also known as CDC2L3, CDK11A, Cell Division Cycle two-like Protein Kinase two, and Cell Division Protein Kinase eleven A.

The target is an enzyme belonging to the CMGC protein kinase group, CMGC protein kinase CDK family, and CMGC protein kinase PITSLRE subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including the mitotic cell cycle, regulation of cell growth, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, cell cycle, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, phosphorylation, regulation of apoptotic process, regulation of RNA splicing, and regulation of centrosome cycle.

Keywords: QSAR, PITSLRE Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase CDC2L2, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, MetaQSAR project, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, cell cycle.
