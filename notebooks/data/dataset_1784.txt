This dataset, named QSAR-TID-103446, belongs to the categories of Economics, Life Science, and MTLQSAR. It was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values measured in pseudo-pCI50 units for various compounds against the drug target TID: 103446. There are seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature called MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation because all bits are generated. The features include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The drug target, also known as Cyclin-dependent Kinase-Like Three, is a single protein found in Homo sapiens. Its synonyms are not available. 

According to ChEMBL, there is no data available for this target. However, Expression Atlas provides information about this gene. Additionally, Go Component reveals that this gene is involved in nucleus and cytoplasm cellular components. 

Go Function further elucidates its role in nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

Furthermore, Go Process indicates its involvement in protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, negative regulation of axon extension, protein modification process, positive regulation of dendrite morphogenesis, regulation of cell cycle, and dendrite extension.

Other databases, such as canSAR-Target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Tchem, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe, also provide information about this gene.
