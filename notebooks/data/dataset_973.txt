Wine Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset has been binarized from the original version. The multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature, where the majority class is labeled as Positive and all others are labeled as Negative.

The dataset originally consisted of various chemical properties of wines, including the levels of alcohol, malic acid, ash, and magnesium, among other compounds. These features have been retained in this binarized version.

The resulting dataset has a binary class label, which simplifies the analysis and allows for easier classification.
