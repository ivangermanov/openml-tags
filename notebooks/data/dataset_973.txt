Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by re-labeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: Alcohol, Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD/OD of diluted wines, Proline, binary Class

This dataset, known as Wine, is a binarized adaptation of an original multi-class dataset. The conversion process involved transforming the target feature from multiple classes into a binary classification, where the majority class is labeled as positive ('P') and all other classes are labeled as negative ('N'). This modification allows for simplified analysis and machine learning applications focused on binary classification problems. The dataset includes various features related to wine composition and characteristics, such as alcohol content, acidity levels, phenolic compounds, and color properties. These attributes can be used to predict the binary classification of wine samples. The original source and date of creation for this dataset are unknown, emphasizing the importance of proper citation when utilizing this resource in research or analytical work.
