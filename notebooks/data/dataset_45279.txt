BOT-IoT is a botnet dataset that can be utilized for device profiling, attack detection, and detection classification. This dataset features a comprehensive set of attributes, including packet sequence identification, start time, flags, protocol, source and destination addresses, source and destination ports, packet and byte counts, state, and sequence duration. Additionally, it includes statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum, and maximum values for packet and byte counts, as well as rates and throughput metrics.

The dataset also provides information on the number of packets and bytes per state, protocol, and destination IP, as well as the number of incoming connections per destination and source IP. Furthermore, it includes attributes related to protocol and port usage, such as the number of packets per state, protocol, and destination IP, and the number of packets per state, protocol, and source IP.

The BOT-IoT dataset is annotated with device information, attack labels, and category and subcategory information, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on IoT security and botnet detection.
