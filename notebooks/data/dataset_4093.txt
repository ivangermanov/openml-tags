This dataset belongs to the regression on categorical and numerical features benchmark. It is one of forty-one drug design datasets, which were formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs were taken from the original studies.

The datasets have one hundred fourteen three features. The last attribute in each file is the target. 

Original studies include Carbolenes, MTP two, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama one, and Yokoyama two. 

These studies were published in various journals including Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science, and others. The studies focused on topics such as molecular descriptors influencing melting points, neighbour behaviour, and quantitative structure activity relationships.

Other datasets include Benzo thirty-two, Phenetyl one, PAH, PDGF-R, Phen, Topo two one, Y Prop four one, QSAR BR one, QSAR BR two, QSAR Tox, QSBR RW one, QSBR Y two, QSBR Alks, QSFR DH LA, QSFSR one, QSFSR two, QSPr CM PX, Selwood.

Features include ozone-related variables.

Keywords: drug design, molecular descriptors, quantitative structure activity relationships, machine learning, regression.
