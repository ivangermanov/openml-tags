The QSAR-TID-30028 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30028. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class features, representing FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is essential to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The features in this dataset do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. However, they may be difficult to read due to their technical nature.

The dataset provides information about the CaM kinase I delta, also known as Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 1D, which belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK1 family. This enzyme plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response, nervous system development, metabolic process, and positive regulation of neuron projection development.

CaM kinase I delta is primarily located in the nucleus and cytoplasm and possesses catalytic activity, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity, protein binding, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

This enzyme is involved in multiple biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response, nervous system development, metabolic process, positive regulation of neuron projection development, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, positive regulation of CREB transcription factor activity, positive regulation of apoptotic process, negative regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of phagocytosis, regulation of dendrite development, positive regulation of respiratory burst, and regulation of granulocyte chemotaxis.
