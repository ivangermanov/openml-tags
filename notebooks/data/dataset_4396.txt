The dataset eye movements has been subsampled using specific parameters to create a new dataset. This process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that only a certain number of classes were selected. The selection was based on the value counts of each class, with the probability of selection being proportional to the value count.

Once the classes were selected, the corresponding indices were identified, and the dataset was filtered to include only those indices. Next, the columns were uniformly sampled, selecting a specific number of columns to include in the new dataset. If the number of rows exceeded a certain threshold, the dataset was further subsampled using stratification, ensuring that the resulting dataset maintained the same distribution of classes as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset includes features such as Line Number, Assignment Number, Previous Fixation Duration, First Fixation Duration, and others. These features have been carefully selected to ensure that the dataset remains representative of the original dataset.
