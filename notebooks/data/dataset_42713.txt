**Bike Sharing Demand**

Tags: **Author**

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental, and return has become automatic. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return it at another position. Currently, there are over five hundred bike-sharing programs around the world, which are composed of over five hundred thousand bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.

Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns the bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors.

The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly available. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information is extracted from a reliable source.
