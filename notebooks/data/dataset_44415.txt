Name: MiniBooNE Seed Three 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset MiniBooNE, generated with a seed of three, with two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes, using stratification.

This dataset is a subsample of the original MiniBooNE dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The dataset features a selection of particle identification variables, including signal, which are used to identify and classify particles.

The subsampling process was performed using a random number generator with a seed of three, ensuring reproducibility of the results. The number of rows was limited to two thousand, and the number of columns was limited to one hundred. The number of classes was limited to ten, and stratification was used to ensure that the classes were represented in proportion to their original frequency.

The resulting dataset is a smaller, more manageable version of the original MiniBooNE dataset, with a reduced number of features and samples.
