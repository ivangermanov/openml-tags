QSAR-TID-11567 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11567. The dataset has seventy-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It contains information about Cathepsin H, also known as Cathepsin H Heavy Chain, Cathepsin H Light Chain, and Cathepsin H Mini Chain.

Cathepsin H is an enzyme that belongs to the cysteine protease family. It is involved in various biological processes, including adaptive immune responses, antigen processing and presentation, and proteolysis.

The dataset provides information about the expression of Cathepsin H in different tissues and its role in various diseases. It also includes information about its structure, function, and interactions with other molecules.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, Cathepsin H, cysteine protease, adaptive immune response, antigen processing, proteolysis.
