Life Science Dataset: QSAR-TID-12635

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12635. It has 85 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is based on data from ChEMBL version 17.

The dataset includes information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description.

The drug target is a single protein known as Protein Kinase C Gamma, which is also referred to as PKCC, PKCG, PKC-Gamma, PRKCC, and PRKCG. It belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and the AGC protein kinase PKC family.

The dataset also includes information about the gene ontology components, functions, and processes associated with the drug target. These include nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, cell-cell junction, postsynaptic density, membrane, dendrite, cell projection, neuron projection, calyx of held, synapse, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, synaptic membrane, presynaptic cytosol, and postsynaptic cytosol.

In terms of function, the drug target is involved in nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity, protein binding, ATP binding, zinc ion binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, metal ion binding, and protein serine kinase activity.

The drug target is also involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, chemical synaptic transmission, learning or memory, chemosensory behavior, response to toxic substance, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, negative regulation of protein ubiquitination, regulation of response to food, positive regulation of mismatch repair, intracellular signal transduction, negative regulation of protein catabolic process, response to chemical, regulation of circadian rhythm, response to morphine, negative regulation of neuron apoptotic process, protein autophosphorylation, response to pain, rhythmic process, regulation of phagocytosis, long-term synaptic potentiation, innervation, and presynaptic modulation of chemical synaptic transmission.
