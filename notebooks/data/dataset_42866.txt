Scraped Data: Dataset Information

The Blood Transfusion Service Center dataset is a demonstration of the RFMTC marketing model, a modified version of the RFM model. This study utilizes the donor database of the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan, where the center operates a blood transfusion service bus that visits a university in Hsin-Chu City every three months to collect blood donations. To build an RFMTC model, a random selection of seven hundred forty-eight donors was made from the donor database. Each of these seven hundred forty-eight donor data points includes information on Recency, or the number of months since the last donation, Frequency, or the total number of donations, Monetary, or the total amount of blood donated in cubic centimeters, Time, or the number of months since the first donation, and a binary variable indicating whether the donor gave blood in March two thousand seven, with one representing a donation and zero representing no donation.
