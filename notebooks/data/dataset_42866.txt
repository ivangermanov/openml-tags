**Dataset Information**

To demonstrate the Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Time, and Compliance marketing model, this study adopted the donor database of the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donations approximately every three months.

To build an RFMTC model, we randomly selected seven hundred forty-eight donors from the donor database. Each donor's data included recency, frequency, monetary value, time, and a binary variable representing whether they donated blood in March two thousand seven.

**Descriptive Statistics of the Data**

The table below shows the descriptive statistics of the data.

| Variable | Data Type | Measurement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recency | Quantitative | Months | Months since last donation |
| Frequency | Quantitative | Times | Total number of donations |
| Monetary Value | Quantitative | cc blood | Total blood donated |
| Time | Quantitative | Months | Months since first donation |
| Donation in March 2007 | Binary | 1=yes, 0=no | Whether they donated blood in March 2007 |
