This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12742. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12742. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Alpha-1d adrenergic receptor, which is a single protein target.

The Alpha-1d adrenergic receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of blood pressure.

The dataset is scraped from ChEMBL, a large-scale bioactivity database that provides information on the interactions between small molecules and biological targets.

The Alpha-1d adrenergic receptor is also known as Adra1a, Adra1d, Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor, and Alpha-1D adrenoceptor. It is a protein target that belongs to the species Rattus norvegicus and is classified as a membrane receptor.

The dataset provides information on the activity values of several compounds on the Alpha-1d adrenergic receptor, which can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
