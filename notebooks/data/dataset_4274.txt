The Meta Album Dogs Dataset is a collection of images featuring various breeds of dogs. This dataset was originally created by researchers at Stanford University and contains over twenty thousand images of one hundred twenty different dog breeds from around the world. The images were obtained from ImageNet and are intended for fine-grained image categorization tasks.

Each class within the dataset has between one hundred forty-eight and two hundred fifty-two images, with resolutions ranging from one hundred by one hundred five pixels to two thousand four hundred forty-eight by three thousand two hundred sixty-four pixels. Due to factors such as color, pose, and occlusion, there is a high degree of intra-class variation within the dataset. Additionally, most images were taken in man-made environments, resulting in significant background variation.

To prepare the dataset for use, images were cropped from either side to create square images. If an image had a resolution lower than one hundred twenty-eight pixels, the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right-most three columns were duplicated to achieve a square shape. The images were then resized to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
