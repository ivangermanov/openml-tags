Texture Database 

Summary 

This database was generated by the Laboratory of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition in the development of the Esprit project ELENA. The original source of the images is the photographic album "Textures: A Photographic Album for Artists and Designers" by P. Brodatz. The creation of the database aimed to study texture discrimination using high-order statistics.

Past Usage 

The database has had private usage at the TIRF laboratory. It was created to study texture discrimination with high-order statistics.

Relevant Information 

The goal is to distinguish between eleven different textures, each characterized by forty attributes built by estimating fourth-order modified moments in four orientations: zero, forty-five, ninety, and one hundred thirty-five degrees. A statistical method based on extracting fourth-order moments for characterizing natural micro-textures was developed, measuring the deviation from a first-order Gauss-Markov process for each texture. The features were estimated in four directions to account for the possible orientations of the textures. Only correlations between the current pixel, the first neighborhood, and the second neighborhood were considered. This small neighborhood was adapted to the fine-grain property of the textures. The dataset contains eleven classes of five hundred instances, and each class refers to a type of texture in the Brodatz album. The database dimension is forty plus one for the class label. The forty attributes were built by estimating the fourth-order modified moments in four orientations.

Class 

The class label is a code for the following classes: Grass Lawn, Pressed Calf Leather, Handmade Paper, Raffia Looped to a High Pile, Cotton Canvas, Pigskin, Beach Sand, Oriental Straw Cloth, and Oriental Grass Fiber Cloth.

Summary Statistics 

A table provides the dynamic, mean value, and standard deviation for each attribute of the database. The dynamic range of the attributes is between negative one point four five and zero point seven seven five.

Confusion Matrix 

A confusion matrix of the k-nearest neighbor classifier was obtained using a leave-one-out error counting method on the centered and reduced texture database. The k-nearest neighbor classifier was set to one to reach the minimum mean error rate of one point zero plus or minus zero point eight percent.

Result of the Principal Component Analysis 

Principal Component Analysis is a classical method in pattern recognition that reduces the sample dimension in a linear way for the best representation in lower dimensions while keeping the maximum of inertia. The best axis for representation is not necessarily the best axis for discrimination. After applying Principal Component Analysis, features are selected according to the percentage of initial inertia covered by the different axes, and the number of features is determined according to the percentage of initial inertia to keep for the classification process. This selection method has been applied to the centered and reduced texture database. When quasi-linear correlations exist between some initial features, these redundant dimensions are removed by Principal Component Analysis, and this preprocessing is then recommended. The texture database projected on its principal components is available.
