Glass Dataset Information

The Glass dataset is a collection of data related to the classification of different types of glass. This dataset is particularly useful in criminological investigations where the correct identification of glass found at a crime scene can serve as crucial evidence.

In one comparative study, three methods were employed to determine whether a given sample of glass was a type of "float" glass or not. These methods included a rule-based system called Beagle, the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis.

The results of this study showed that when analyzing windows that were float processed, Beagle incorrectly classified ten samples, the nearest-neighbor algorithm misclassified twelve samples, and discriminant analysis misclassified twenty-one samples. Similarly, for windows that were not float processed, Beagle misclassified nineteen samples, the nearest-neighbor algorithm misclassified sixteen samples, and discriminant analysis misclassified twenty-two samples.

This dataset contains nine features, including the refractive index, sodium content, magnesium content, aluminum content, silicon content, potassium content, calcium content, barium content, and iron content. Each feature is measured in terms of its weight percentage in the corresponding oxide.

The class attribute in this dataset categorizes the glass into seven types: building windows that are float processed, building windows that are not float processed, vehicle windows that are float processed, vehicle windows that are not float processed, containers, tableware, and headlamps.
