Glass Dataset Information

The Glass dataset is a collection of data used to compare the performance of different classification algorithms. In determining whether the glass was a type of float glass or not, a comparison test was conducted between a rule-based system, a nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis. The results of this test showed that the rule-based system outperformed the other two algorithms in correctly identifying the type of glass.

The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of a crime, the glass left behind can be used as evidence if it is correctly identified. This is because different types of glass have distinct characteristics that can be used to determine their origin.

The dataset contains nine features that describe the chemical composition of the glass. These features include the refractive index, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, barium, and iron. The class attribute is the type of glass, which can be one of seven categories: building windows float processed, building windows non-float processed, vehicle windows float processed, vehicle windows non-float processed, containers, tableware, or headlamps.

The dataset has no missing values and consists of 214 samples.
