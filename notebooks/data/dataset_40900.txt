The satellite dataset comprises features extracted from satellite observations, where each image was taken under four different light wavelengths, two in visible light (green and red) and two infrared images. The task of the original dataset is to classify the image into the soil category of the observed region.

We defined the soil classes "Red Soil", "Gray Soil", "Damp Gray Soil", and "Very Damp Gray Soil" as the normal class. From the semantically different classes "Cotton Crop" and "Soil with Vegetation Stubble", anomalies are sampled. After merging the original training and test set into a single dataset, the resulting dataset contains normal instances as well as randomly sampled anomalies with thirty-six dimensions.

This dataset is not the original dataset. The target variable 'Target' is relabeled into 'Normal' and 'Anomaly'. The dataset features include various variables.
