The Satellite dataset comprises of features extracted from satellite observations, specifically capturing images under four different light wavelengths - two in visible light, namely green and red, and two infrared images. The primary objective of the original dataset is to classify the image into the soil category of the observed region.

We have defined four distinct soil classes - Red Soil, Gray Soil, Damp Gray Soil, and Very Damp Gray Soil - which are considered as the normal class. On the other hand, two semantically different classes - Cotton Crop and Soil with Vegetation Stubble - are sampled as anomalies.

After merging the original training and test sets into a single dataset, the resulting dataset contains a significant number of normal instances, along with a smaller number of randomly sampled anomalies, featuring thirty-six dimensions.

A Comparative Evaluation of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Algorithms for Multivariate Data is a relevant paper associated with this dataset.

This dataset is a modified version of the original dataset, where the target variable has been relabeled into Normal and Anomaly categories.
