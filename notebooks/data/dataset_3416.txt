QSAR-TID-10648 Dataset

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10648. The dataset has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and many others.
