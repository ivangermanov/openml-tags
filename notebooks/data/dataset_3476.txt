Computer Systems and Machine Learning Context: 
For my final year project, I started working on a comprehensive dataset of car reviews, which I later improved upon during the quarantine period.

The dataset consists of a mix of both used and new car reviews spanning from the year two thousand to two nineteen, covering various popular brands available in the United States, sourced from edmunds dot com. Although I did not include every single brand available, I focused on incorporating the most well-known and widely recognized brands in the American market.

To provide a clear understanding of how the dataset works, I added a detailed notebook that offers a step-by-step walkthrough. 

Inspiration behind creating this dataset was the lack of availability of a proper car review dataset for my final year project, which prompted me to take matters into my own hands and create one.

Key Features of the Dataset:
The dataset includes essential information about each car review, including the company that manufactured the vehicle, its model name, the year it was released, the reviewer who wrote the review, the date when the review was published, the title given to the review, the rating assigned to the vehicle, and finally, the review itself.
