QSAR-TID-118 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 1024 features.
