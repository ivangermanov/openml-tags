Subsampling of the dataset San Francisco Police Incidents with a specified seed value.

Generated with the following source code:

This function allows us to subsample a given dataset according to certain parameters. It takes into account the number of rows, columns, and classes we want our new dataset to have, as well as whether we want to stratify our sampling or not.

The function first selects the unique classes present in the dataset and then randomly chooses a specified number of them. It then selects the indices where one of these chosen classes is present and uses those indices to create a new dataset.

If the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum, the function uniformly samples the columns to reduce their number. Similarly, if the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum, the function uses a stratified split to select a specified number of rows while maintaining the class distribution.

Finally, the function converts any categorical columns to strings and returns the resulting dataset along with its characteristics.
