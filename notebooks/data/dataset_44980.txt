**Data Description**
A realistic simulation of the forward dynamics of an eight link all revolute robot arm is presented in this dataset. The task at hand is to predict the distance of the end effector from a target. The input consists of the angular positions of the joints. This task is characterized as medium noisy and nonlinear. Each instance represents a configuration of angular positions of the joints and the resulting distance of the end effector from a target.

**Attribute Description**
The attributes in this dataset include the angular positions of the joints, which are denoted by theta one through theta eight, and the resulting distance of the end effector from the target, which is denoted by y.

Features: theta one, theta two, theta three, theta four, theta five, theta six, theta seven, theta eight, y

Keywords: robot arm, forward dynamics, angular positions, end effector, target distance, noisy, nonlinear.
