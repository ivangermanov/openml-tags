This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This process involves categorizing the data into two distinct groups based on the mean value, resulting in a more simplified and easy-to-analyze format.

The dataset includes various features, although they may not be easily interpretable due to their technical nature.
