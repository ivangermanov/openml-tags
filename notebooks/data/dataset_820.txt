Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: column one, column two, column three, column four, column five, column six, column seven, column eight, column nine, column ten, column eleven, column twelve, binary class

This dataset represents a binarized adaptation of an original dataset, transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this computed mean. Instances with target values below the mean are classified as positive, denoted by 'P', while those at or above the mean are classified as negative, denoted by 'N'. This binarization technique simplifies the original dataset's complexity, potentially facilitating certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that are better suited to binary classification problems.

The dataset comprises twelve distinct columns of data, each representing a different feature or attribute of the instances. These features, combined with the newly created binary class column, provide a comprehensive set of information for each data point. The binary class serves as the target variable for classification tasks, offering a clear dichotomy between positive and negative instances based on the original numeric values.

Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should be aware of its binarized nature and consider the implications of this transformation on their analyses and models. The simplification of the target variable may impact the granularity of insights that can be derived from the data, but it also opens up opportunities for applying binary classification algorithms and techniques.
