The Optdigits dataset has been binarized from its original form. This process involved converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the majority class was relabeled as positive, denoted by 'Positive', while all other classes were relabeled as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

This dataset contains a wide range of features, including various inputs. 

The Optdigits dataset belongs to the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and others.
