Multiple Features Dataset: Karhunen
Tags: OpenML-CC, OpenML, study, uci

This dataset is part of a collection of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (zero to nine) extracted from Dutch utility maps. The patterns across different datasets correspond to the same original characters. A total of two thousand instances have been digitized in binary images, with two hundred instances per class.

The attributes represent descriptors from the Karhunen-Loeve Transform, a linear transform that corresponds to the projection of the images on the eigenvectors of a covariant matrix. This particular dataset focuses on the Karhunen-Love coefficients.

The complete Multiple Features Dataset consists of six feature sets:
- Fourier coefficients of the character shapes
- Profile correlations
- Karhunen-Love coefficients
- Pixel averages in two by three windows
- Zernike moments
- Morphological features

In each file, the two thousand patterns are stored in ASCII format, with each pattern on a separate line. The patterns are grouped by class, with the first two hundred patterns belonging to class 'zero', followed by sets of two hundred patterns for each of the classes 'one' through 'nine'.

It's worth noting that while the source image dataset has been lost, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained using the pixel dataset, resulting in images of fifteen by sixteen pixels.

This dataset has been used in various studies and papers related to handwritten digit recognition and statistical pattern recognition. It has been particularly useful in research comparing combined classifiers and reviewing statistical pattern recognition techniques.

The dataset does not contain any missing values, making it suitable for a wide range of machine learning applications and studies.
