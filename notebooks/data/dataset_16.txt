**Multiple Features Dataset: Pixel**

This dataset is one of a set of six datasets that describe features of handwritten numerals (zero through nine) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. The maps were scanned in eight-bit grey value at a density of four hundred dots per inch, sharpened, and then thresholded. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. Two thousand instances, two hundred per class, have been digitized in binary images.

Using this dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained, with a resolution of fifteen by sixteen pixels. The Multiple Features Dataset represents two hundred forty pixel averages in two by three windows.

This dataset has been used in various studies, including hand-written digit recognition by combined classifiers and statistical pattern recognition.

The Multiple Features Dataset has been divided into six files, each representing a different feature set. These feature sets include Fourier coefficients of the character shapes, profile correlations, Karhunen-Love coefficients, pixel averages in two by three windows, Zernike moments, and morphological features.
