Ceres Discovery Data 

Tags: Earth Science, Meteorology 

Twenty-two observations of the dwarf planet Ceres, published in the monthly correspondence edition of September, provide a comprehensive record of the planet's movement patterns. These meticulous recordings served as the foundation for modeling the planet's orbit, ultimately leading to its successful recovery a mere three months later. The dataset encompasses a range of crucial features, including Median Solar Time, Right Ascension in Time, Right Ascension in Degrees, Northern Declination, Geocentric Longitude, Geocentric Latitude, Sun's Position with twenty arcseconds Aberration, and Logarithmic Distance.
