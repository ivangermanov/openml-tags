Description: This dataset combines multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of communities and crime. It includes a wide range of variables related to the community, such as the percentage of the population considered urban, median family income, and law enforcement, including the per capita number of police officers and the percentage of officers assigned to drug units. The dataset also includes eighteen crime attributes, including the eight Index Crimes considered by the FBI, such as murder, rape, and robbery, as well as per capita violent and nonviolent crimes.

A limitation of the dataset is that it only includes communities with at least one hundred police officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. Additionally, many communities are missing Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) data. The per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values from the 1995 FBI data, which differ from the 1990 Census values.

The dataset requires further preprocessing, including selecting a desirable dependent variable from among the eighteen possible crime attributes. It is also necessary to remove identifying variables, such as community name, county code, and community code, which are not predictive and may interfere with some algorithms.

The FBI notes that using this data to evaluate communities is oversimplistic, as many relevant factors are not included. For example, communities with large numbers of visitors will have higher per capita crime rates than communities with fewer visitors, other things being equal.
