QSAR-TID-134 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 134. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 878 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The Vasopressin V1a receptor is a single protein, also known as Antidiuretic hormone receptor 1a, AVPR1, AVPR1A, AVPR V1a, and V1aR. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a Peptide receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, maternal aggressive behavior, and the generation of precursor metabolites and energy.

The receptor is targeted by various compounds, including Balovaptan, SRX246, Conivaptan, Relcovaptan, and Selepressin, which act as antagonists or agonists. These compounds have different mechanisms of action and have been tested in various phases of clinical trials.

The receptor is also involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and the activation of phospholipase C activity. It is also involved in the regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, and cell growth.
