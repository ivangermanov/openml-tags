The QSAR-TID-12299 dataset, tagged with MTLQSAR and study_3, consists of Text and Literature data. It was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 12299. It has forty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The scraped data includes information about the Human Herpesvirus Two Protease, also known as Assemblin, Assembly Protein, Capsid Assembly Protein, Capsid Protein P Forty, and Capsid Protein VP Twenty-Two A. This enzyme belongs to the Serine Protease SH Clan and Serine Protease S Twenty-One Family. It is classified as a single protein and is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, viral process, and viral release from host cells.

The Human Herpesvirus Two Protease is located in the host cell cytoplasm and host cell nucleus. It exhibits serine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and identical protein binding.
