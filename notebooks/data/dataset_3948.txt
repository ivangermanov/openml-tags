Historical Financials Data for Stocks

Machine Learning, Statistics

Getting access to high-quality historical stock market data can be a daunting task, often requiring significant expense and effort. Parsing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 10-Q filings directly from the SEC Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system can be particularly challenging due to the varying structures of filings. Furthermore, obtaining SEC filing data from providers such as Quandl can come with hefty yearly fees.

In response to this challenge, this dataset provides an easy-to-use, comprehensive database of parsed financials information derived directly from SEC 10-Q filings for over three thousand stocks.

The quarterly financials are presented in a single CSV file, Quarterly Financials.csv. It is important to note that approximately half of the data may contain null values, which may occur when the field was not detected by the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) parsing system or when the field was not addressed in the SEC filing.

All data has been scraped from the SEC using XBRL files.

This dataset boasts numerous valuable features, including:

* Filing Date
* Cash
* Revenues
* Gross Profit
* Operating Expenses
* Net Income/Loss
* Earnings per Share
* Dividends
* Inventory
* Accounts Receivable
* Accrued Income Taxes
* Shares Outstanding
* Borrowed Funds
* Debt
* Intangible Assets
* Salaries and Wages
* Interest and Debt Expense
