QSAR-TID-100143 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100143. The dataset has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are useful for predicting the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The Vitamin D Receptor is a single protein target that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including transcription, cell morphogenesis, and skeletal system development. It is also involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, calcium ion transport, and intracellular calcium ion homeostasis.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and caveolae, and is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. It is also a key player in the vitamin D signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis and bone health.
