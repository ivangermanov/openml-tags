QSAR-TID-100918 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100918. The dataset has eighty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100918. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has eighty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Myotonin-Protein Kinase, which is a single protein target. The Myotonin-Protein Kinase is also known as DM1PK, DM1 Protein Kinase, DMK, DM-Kinase, and DMPK. It is a protein kinase that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, muscle cell apoptotic process, and regulation of heart contraction.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the Myotonin-Protein Kinase in various tissues and cells, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and endoplasmic reticulum. It also provides information on the protein's function, including its role in protein phosphorylation, protein binding, and ATP binding.
