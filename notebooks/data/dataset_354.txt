Name: Poker
Tags: UCI

This is the Poker dataset, retrieved from the libSVM site. In addition to the preprocessing performed there (see LibSVM site for details), this dataset was created by combining the test and train datasets (non-scaled versions), relabeling classes with positive class as zero and negative classes as one through nine, and normalizing each file columnwise according to specific rules. For constant features, the value is set to zero and removed due to sparsity. Binary features are adjusted so that the more frequent value becomes zero and the less frequent value becomes one. Multinary or real features are divided by their standard deviation.

It is important to note that the Poker dataset has a mild redundancy, with approximately zero point two percent duplicated data points within each file (train and test). These duplicated points have not been removed from the dataset.

Features include Y, X one through X ten.
