QSAR-TID-10908 Tags: Computer Systems, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10908, and it has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and various molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR models and datasets for various biological targets.

The target protein is Plasminogen, also known as Activation Peptide Plasmin Heavy Chain A, Plasmin Heavy Chain A Short Form, Plasmin Light Chain B, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species Bos Taurus, and its protein target classification is Enzyme Protease Serine Protease Serine Protease PA Clan Serine Protease S One A Subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, blood coagulation, hemostasis, response to heat, fibrinolysis, and tissue remodeling. It also has various molecular functions, such as endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, signaling receptor binding, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and protein domain-specific binding.
