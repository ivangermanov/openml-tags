QSAR-TID-101312 Tags: MTLQSAR, Social Media, Statistics, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero one three one two, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
