The QSAR-TID-10505 dataset is a collection of QSAR data related to the manufacturing industry, specifically focused on the MetaQSAR project. This dataset contains activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10505, with sixty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset includes various features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty, as well as numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

The source of this dataset is the MetaQSAR project, which was conducted in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset pertains to the carboxypeptidase A one enzyme, which is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including carboxypeptidase A one, CPA, and CPA one. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under the enzyme/protease/metallo protease/metallo protease MC clan/metallo protease M fourteen A subfamily category.

Carboxypeptidase A one is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, leukotriene metabolic process, response to cadmium ion, and proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process. It also has molecular functions such as carboxypeptidase activity, metallocarboxypeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, exopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.
