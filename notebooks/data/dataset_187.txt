Wine Recognition Data

This dataset contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The data were originally used for comparing various classifiers. The classes are separable, though only one classifier achieved perfect classification. In a classification context, this is a well-posed problem with "well-behaved" class structures, making it a good dataset for initial testing of new classifiers, though not particularly challenging.

The attributes include measurements of alcohol content, malic acid, ash, alkalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, OD/OD of diluted wines, and proline. All attributes are continuous.

The dataset consists of multiple instances divided into three classes. There are no missing attribute values. It is suggested to standardize variables for certain uses, particularly with classifiers that are not scale-invariant.

The data originated from an institute in Genoa, Italy, focusing on pharmaceutical and food analysis and technologies. It has been used in various studies and technical reports, demonstrating its utility in comparing classification techniques and illustrating the performance of different analytical approaches.

This wine recognition data serves as a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in classification problems, particularly in the context of food and beverage analysis. Its well-structured nature and complete attribute information make it an excellent starting point for exploring various machine learning and statistical techniques.
