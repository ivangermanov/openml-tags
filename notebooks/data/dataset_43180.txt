IEEE 80211aa GATS Tags: Data shows the downlink goodput for unicast and multicast transmissions with different group sizes and network loads on an IEEE 802.11ac network simulated on NS-3. Different IEEE 802.11aa Group Address Translation Services are used.

The dataset features include the level of the simulation, the number of multicast stations, the number of unicast stations, an index, the average data rate of the downlink, the average data rate of the uplink, the delay of the downlink for multicast transmissions, the delay of the downlink for unicast transmissions, the delay of the uplink, the goodput of the downlink for multicast transmissions, the goodput of the downlink for unicast transmissions, the goodput of the uplink, the amount of multicast data injected, the amount of unicast data injected for downlink and uplink, the multicast mode, the occupancy of the network, the occupancy of the downlink, the occupancy of the uplink, the number of retries, the number of bytes retransmitted for unicast downlink, the number of bytes retransmitted for unicast uplink, the share of retransmitted bytes for downlink, the share of retransmitted bytes for uplink, the number of bytes received for downlink multicast, the number of bytes received for downlink unicast, the number of bytes received for uplink, the throughput of multicast downlink, the throughput of unicast downlink, the throughput of uplink, and the time.
