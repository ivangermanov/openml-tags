The PBCSeq Dataset: A Binarized Version for Regression Problems 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset originates from the fields of Chemistry and Life Sciences, specifically focusing on MythBusting and Study datasets. 

Features included in this dataset are Case Number, Number of Days, Status, Drug, Age, Sex, Day, Presence of Ascites, Presence of Hepatomegaly, Presence of Spiders, Presence of Edema, Serum Bilirubin, Serum Cholesterol, Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase, SGOT, Platelets, Prothrombin Time, and Binary Class.
