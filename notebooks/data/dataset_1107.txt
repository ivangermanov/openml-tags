This dataset comes from the LIBSVM data repository. It has undergone preprocessing, which includes instance-wise normalization to mean zero and variance one, followed by feature-wise normalization to mean zero and variance one.

The original dataset consisted of forty-nine instances. However, five were removed due to conflicting classification results obtained through immunohistochemistry and protein immunoblotting assays. Additionally, two instances were rejected because of failed array hybridization. The remaining data was then split into training and validation sets, comprising thirty-eight and four instances, respectively.

The dataset features a large number of attributes, including gene expressions.
