QSAR-TID-17021 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17021. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17021. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets.

The dataset is related to the Bradykinin B2 receptor, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is classified as a Family A G protein-coupled receptor and a Peptide receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset is annotated with various cross-references, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. It is also part of the canSAR-Target database.
