Context 
This is a forked subset of the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset, enriched with weather, borough, and holidays information. 

Content 
I created this dataset for a personal project of exploring and predicting pickups in the area by merging data that intuitively seem possible factors for the analysis. These are Uber Pickups in New York City, from the beginning of the year to the middle of the year, and weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information. Additionally, I included a location ID to borough mapping and New York City public holidays. 

The main dataset contained a large number of observations of a few variables, which were aggregated per hour and borough, and then joined with the rest of the datasets producing a smaller number of observations across a larger number of variables. These variables include the time period of the observations, the New York City borough, the number of pickups for the period, wind speed, visibility, temperature, dew point, sea level pressure, one hour, six hour, and twenty-four hour liquid precipitation, snow depth, and whether it was a holiday or not.
