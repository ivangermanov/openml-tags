Name: Phoneme Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Phoneme with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility. The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable y, and if the number of classes is greater than nclasses max, it selects a subset of classes using the value counts of each class as probabilities. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

If the number of columns is greater than ncols max, the function uniformly samples columns by selecting a subset of column indices and sorting them. It then subsets the data to include only these columns. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, including the categorical mask and column names.
