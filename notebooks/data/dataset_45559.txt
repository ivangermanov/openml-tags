Data Set Information: Information about customers consists of eighty-six variables and includes product usage data and socio-demographic data derived from zip area codes. The data was supplied by the Dutch data mining company Sentient Machine Research and is based on a real-world business problem. The training set contains over five thousand descriptions of customers, including the information of whether or not they have a caravan insurance policy. A test set contains four thousand customers of whom only the organizers know if they have a caravan insurance policy. The data dictionary describes the variables used and their values. Note: All the variables starting with M are zipcode variables. They give information on the distribution of that variable, for example, Rented house, in the zipcode area of the customer. One instance per line with tab-delimited fields.

TICDATA2000.txt: Dataset to train and validate prediction models and build a description (five thousand eight hundred twenty-two customer records). Each record consists of eighty-six attributes, containing sociodemographic data (attribute one to forty-three) and product ownership (attributes forty-four to eighty-six). The sociodemographic data is derived from zip codes. All customers living in areas with the same zip code have the same sociodemographic attributes. Attribute eighty-six, "Number of mobile home policies", is the target variable.
