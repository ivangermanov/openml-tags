Anime Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

As a fan of Japanese animated media, also known as anime, I have always been driven by a desire to accumulate comprehensive information about every anime series I could lay my hands on.

This dataset was compiled by scraping data from Anime Planet, a renowned online platform dedicated to anime enthusiasts. The data scraping process was completed on a specific date.

I extend my gratitude to Anime Planet for designing a user-friendly website that facilitated the extraction of relevant information with ease.

Inspired by the potential of this dataset, I envision conducting an analysis to identify the key factors that influence the overall rating of an anime series. Furthermore, I aspire to develop a sophisticated recommendation engine capable of suggesting personalized anime recommendations to users based on their preferences.

The dataset encompasses a diverse range of attributes, including the anime title, media type, number of episodes, episode duration, status of the series, release year, season of release, detailed description, production studios involved, genres, content warnings, viewer statistics, and average ratings.
