This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11720. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11720. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generally, generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset, which contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11720. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, which is commonly used for generating fingerprints. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation because all bits are generated during this process.
