QSAR-TID-11720 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11720. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features of the dataset include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to Casein Kinase I Alpha, a protein target that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and protein phosphorylation. The protein is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and machine learning applications, such as predicting the activity of new compounds against Casein Kinase I Alpha. The data can also be used for target validation and drug discovery.
