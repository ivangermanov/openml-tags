Life Science and Sociology Study Dataset 

This dataset is tagged with Life Science and Sociology, and is part of the study eighty-eight collection. It is derived from the Musk dataset, which is available on OpenML.

The dataset contains information about molecules, including their names and conformations. The molecular data includes various features, such as molecular properties and characteristics.

Some of the molecular properties included in the dataset are molecular weight, chemical structure, and physical properties. These features provide valuable insights into the behavior and characteristics of different molecules.

The dataset also includes information about molecular conformations, which refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within a molecule. This information is useful for understanding how molecules interact with each other and their environment.

Overall, this dataset provides a comprehensive view of molecular structures and properties, making it a useful resource for researchers and scientists in the fields of life science and sociology.
