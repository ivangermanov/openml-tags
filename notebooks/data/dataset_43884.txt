Machine Learning and Statistics MEG Data from Auditory Stimulation Experiment

This dataset contains MEG data from an auditory stimulation experiment using three hundred five sensors. The design matrix or forward operator is comprised of the first seven thousand four hundred ninety-eight columns of the data. The measurements for left stimulation are found in columns seven thousand four hundred ninety-eight to seven thousand five hundred eighty-three, while the measurements for right stimulation occupy the remaining columns.

The data was generated using a Python script that utilized the MNE library, version one point zero two. The script read in a noise covariance matrix and handled a forward solution, which involved depth weighting and whitening. The data was then whitened and prepared for analysis.

The dataset consists of numerous features, including various sensor readings and measurements from the auditory stimulation experiment.
