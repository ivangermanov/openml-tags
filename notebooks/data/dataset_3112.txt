This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor Two, and it has sixty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
