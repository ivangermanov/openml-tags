QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule identifiers and median activity values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Corticotropin releasing factor receptor, a single protein target found in Mus musculus. This receptor belongs to the Family B G protein-coupled receptor class, specifically the peptide receptor subgroup. It is also known as the Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor, CRF R, and several other synonyms.

The receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane and various neuronal structures including axons, dendrites, and cell bodies. Its functions include transmembrane signaling, G protein-coupled receptor activity, hormone activity, and protein binding. The receptor plays roles in numerous biological processes such as signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling, hormone-mediated signaling, regulation of heart rate, gene expression, neurotransmitter secretion, and various other physiological functions.

The Corticotropin releasing factor receptor is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including G protein-coupled receptor signaling, adenylate cyclase modulation, and protein kinase C activation. It also participates in the regulation of various hormones and neurotransmitters, affecting processes like blood pressure, muscle growth, synaptic potentiation, and feeding behavior.

This receptor is referenced in several biological databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and Reactome, indicating its significance in various biological contexts and its well-studied nature in the scientific community.
