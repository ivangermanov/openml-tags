The QSAR-TID-101152 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Motilin Receptor. This dataset has multiple rows and numerous features, including molecular identifiers and a class feature representing the median pseudo-pCI50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset originates from the MetaQSAR project, specifically from September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite the source when utilizing this dataset.

The Motilin Receptor is a single protein, also known as MLNR, and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, specifically the peptide receptor subfamily. This receptor is primarily located in the cytosol and plasma membrane, and its functions involve G protein-coupled receptor activity, G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity, and hormone binding.

In terms of biological processes, the Motilin Receptor is involved in signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways.
