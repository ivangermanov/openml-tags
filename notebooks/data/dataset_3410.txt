QSAR-TID-101152 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101152. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features of the dataset include Molecule ChEMBL ID, as well as multiple FCFP features, which are molecular fingerprints used to describe the chemical structure of compounds. These features are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Motilin receptor, which is a single protein target classified as a membrane receptor and a family A G protein-coupled receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
