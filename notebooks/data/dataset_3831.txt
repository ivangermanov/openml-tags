The thirteen properties used to describe each camera model are:

* Camera Model
* Release Date
* Maximum Resolution
* Minimum Resolution
* Effective Pixels
* Wide Angle Zoom Capability
* Telephoto Zoom Capability
* Standard Focus Range
* Macro Focus Range
* Included Storage Capacity
* Weight Including Batteries
* Dimensions
* Price

This dataset has been carefully gathered and cleaned up, and its original source is available online. It has also been conveniently converted into a comma-separated values format.
