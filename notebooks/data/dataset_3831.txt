QSAR-TID-101048 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101048. The dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101048. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 101048, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK three.

Serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK three is a single protein that belongs to the ULK family of protein kinases. It is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, protein phosphorylation, and smoothened signaling pathway. The protein is localized in the cytoplasm, autophagosome, and phagophore assembly site membrane.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK three. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of activity values for various compounds, which can be used to develop and validate QSAR models.
