QSAR-TID-12336 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12336. The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings, which are a notation for describing molecular structures. The fingerprints are used to capture the structural properties of molecules, which can be used to predict their activity on a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop predictive models for drug activity on the Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma target. The dataset provides a comprehensive set of molecular fingerprints and activity values, which can be used to train and test machine learning models.

Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, and embryonic development. It is a key regulator of gene expression and is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers who want to develop predictive models for drug activity on various targets.
