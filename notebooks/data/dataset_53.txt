Heart-Statlog Dataset

Tags: mythbusting, study, uci

This database contains attributes (which have been extracted from a larger set) related to heart disease diagnosis. The attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia status.

The attributes are categorized as real, ordered, binary, or nominal. The variable to be predicted is the absence or presence of heart disease. A cost matrix is provided where the rows represent true values and columns represent predicted values, with different costs assigned to false positives and false negatives.

The dataset contains observations with no missing values. The class attribute has been relabeled from numerical values to "absent" and "present" for clarity.

This heart disease dataset is commonly used in machine learning and medical research to develop and evaluate predictive models for diagnosing heart conditions. It provides a comprehensive set of clinical and diagnostic features that can be analyzed to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease.

The data can be used to train classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical attributes. This has potential applications in early detection and risk assessment in clinical settings.

Researchers and data scientists often use this dataset for comparative studies, algorithm benchmarking, and exploring the relative importance of different factors in heart disease diagnosis. The inclusion of both continuous and categorical variables allows for diverse analytical approaches.
