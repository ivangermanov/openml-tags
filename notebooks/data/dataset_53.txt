Heart Statlog Database 

Tags: Health, Medicine, Myth Busting 

This database contains thirteen attributes which have been extracted from a larger set of seventy-five. 

Attribute Information 
The attributes included in this dataset are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level in milligrams per deciliter, whether the individual has a fasting blood sugar level greater than one hundred twenty milligrams per deciliter, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, whether exercise induces angina, old peak, which represents the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thal, which represents the health of the individual's heart. 

Attributes Types 
The attributes included in this dataset can be categorized into three groups: real-valued attributes, ordered attributes, and binary attributes. The real-valued attributes include age, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, maximum heart rate achieved, old peak, and the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy. The ordered attribute is the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. The binary attributes include sex, whether the individual has a fasting blood sugar level greater than one hundred twenty milligrams per deciliter, and whether exercise induces angina. The nominal attributes include chest pain type, resting electrocardiographic results, and thal. 

Variable to be Predicted 
The variable to be predicted in this dataset is the presence or absence of heart disease. 

Cost Matrix 
The cost matrix for this dataset is as follows:
Absence Presence
Absence 0 1
Presence 5 0
where the rows represent the true values and the columns represent the predicted values. 

Dataset Information 
This dataset does not contain any missing values and includes two hundred seventy observations. 

Additional Information 
The values in the class attribute have been relabeled for easier understanding. The original values were one for absence and two for presence, but they have been relabeled as absent and present respectively.
