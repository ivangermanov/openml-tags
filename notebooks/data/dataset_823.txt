Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

The dataset contains information about housing in California, including various attributes such as median house value, median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and latitude. The target variable is a binary classification of house prices.

This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for classification tasks and comparative studies between regression and classification approaches. It provides researchers and data scientists with an opportunity to explore housing market trends and factors influencing property values in a simplified, binary context.

The transformation of the original continuous target variable into a binary classification problem allows for the application of a wide range of machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques specifically designed for binary outcomes. This can be especially valuable for hypothesis testing, model comparison, and exploratory data analysis in the field of real estate and urban planning.
