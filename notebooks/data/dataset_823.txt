Houses Dataset 

Tags: Binarized Regression Problem, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The conversion process involved transforming the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset comprises several features, including Median House Value, Median Income, Housing Median Age, Total Rooms, Population, Households, and Latitude. These features were carefully selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
