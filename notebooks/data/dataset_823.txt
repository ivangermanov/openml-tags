This binarized version of the original dataset has been modified to convert the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

The dataset includes various features, including Wife's Age, Wife's Education Level, Husband's Education Level, Number of Children Ever Born, Wife's Religion, whether the Wife is Currently Working, Husband's Occupation, Standard of Living Index, and Media Exposure.

Binary Class is the target feature of this dataset.
