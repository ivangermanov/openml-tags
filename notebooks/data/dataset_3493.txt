QSAR-TID-101361 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101361. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target is a single protein, specifically a membrane receptor, and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The dataset also contains information about the compounds, including their ChEMBL IDs, molecule names, and mechanism of action. The compounds are small molecules that act as agonists on the trace amine-associated receptor one.

The dataset is related to various biological processes, including signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also related to various cellular components, including the plasma membrane and membrane.
