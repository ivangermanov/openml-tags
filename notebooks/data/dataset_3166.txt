QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Serotonin f (HT f) receptor, also known as HT F, hydroxytryptamine receptor F, HTR EL, and HTR F. This receptor is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor (family A GPCR) subgroup, and is classified as a monoamine receptor and serotonin receptor.

The Serotonin f receptor is associated with several related targets, including the broader Serotonin (HT) receptor family, HT A/HT F selectivity group, HT B/HT F selectivity group, and HT D/HT F selectivity group. It is also part of the larger Serotonin (HT) receptor protein family.

Several drugs target the Serotonin f receptor, including almotriptan, lasmiditan, and eletriptan. These small molecule compounds act as Serotonin f (HT f) receptor agonists and have reached advanced clinical phases.

The receptor is involved in various cellular components, including the plasma membrane, dendrites, and synapses. Its functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, serotonin receptor activity, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and serotonin binding. The receptor participates in several biological processes, such as signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting signaling pathways, and chemical synaptic transmission.

Additional information about the Serotonin f receptor can be found in various databases and resources, including Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
