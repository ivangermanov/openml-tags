The Production Cross Sections of the Inert Doublet Model Training Data Set

This data set is part of the Pheno AI training dataset used in the subproject "Learning the Production Cross Sections of the Inert Doublet Model". It consists of fifty thousand samples with five input values: the mass of the lightest neutral scalar, the mass of the pseudoscalar, the mass of the charged scalar, lambda two, and lambda L. These inputs correspond to eight target values representing the production cross sections at various energies.

The Inert Doublet Model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model by a second Higgs doublet with no direct couplings to quarks or leptons. This scenario is one of the simplest explanations for dark matter. 

The cross sections were computed at leading order using MadGraph and the IDM UFO implementation from the FeynRules database. The parameter space of the Inert Doublet Model was chosen as follows: the masses of the scalars range up to three thousand GeV, while lambda two and lambda L range up to two.

Additional information about this dataset can be found through the Pheno AI training data project, which is part of the Les Houches project for creating a database of networks for regression and classification of quantities relevant for particle physics phenomenology.
