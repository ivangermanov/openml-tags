QSAR-TID-99 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 99. The dataset has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor.

The Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor is a single protein target that plays a crucial role in the regulation of reproductive processes. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in the signaling pathway of follicle-stimulating hormone.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, testis, and pituitary gland, and is involved in the regulation of gametogenesis, gonad development, and hormone-mediated signaling pathways.
