AI Simulated Games of Machi Koro

Tags: Context

This data is the result of using neural networks and reinforcement learning to simulate the board game Machi Koro. The source code for the AI and simulation is available online.

Each row is a single turn in a game, corresponding to the state at the beginning of the turn, and there are a large number of games total. There are four players, so all columns except for Game ID and Turn ID reference a specific player. Each player takes turns performing actions, which can involve gaining coins, losing coins to other players, building properties, stealing coins from other players, and possibly switching properties with another player. The results of each turn largely depend on a single or double dice roll. The goal of the game is to build four specific properties, which are represented by the variables.

Variables:

Game ID - ID of the game being played
Turn ID - Turn number of the game. An additional turn is added at the end of each game to show the final state.
The following attributes have a prefix Player X, where X is the ID of the player, which also corresponds to the turn order:
Win - Has the player won the game (class)
Coins - The number of coins the player has (integer)
Each of these corresponds to the number of properties a player has constructed by this point in the game.

Inspiration
I wondered if I could teach an AI the game, given its relatively simple rules. It is a fairly straightforward game, and I wanted to record the game history so that I could extract insights, such as strategy and overall usefulness of certain properties or cards.

Features:
Game ID, Turn ID, Player Zero Amusement Park, Player Zero Apple Orchard, Player Zero Bakery, Player Zero Business Center, Player Zero Cafe, Player Zero Cheese Factory, Player Zero Convenience Store, Player Zero Family Restaurant, Player Zero Forest, Player Zero Fruit and Vegetable Market, Player Zero Furniture Factory, Player Zero Mine, Player Zero Radio Tower, Player Zero Ranch, Player Zero Shopping Mall, Player Zero Stadium, Player Zero Station, Player Zero TV Station, Player Zero Wheat Field, Player Zero Coins, Player Zero Win, and so on for each player.
