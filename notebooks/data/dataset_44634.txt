Segment Seed One Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the original segment dataset, generated with a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns from the original dataset, followed by stratified sampling of rows to ensure a balanced representation of classes.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded the maximum allowed, a random selection of classes was made, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class. The indices of the selected classes were then used to filter the original dataset, reducing it to only include samples from the chosen classes.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled, with the number of columns reduced to the maximum allowed. The selected columns were then used to filter the dataset, reducing it to only include the chosen features.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were stratified sampled, with the goal of achieving a balanced representation of classes. This involved concatenating the feature data with the target variable, and then using a stratified sampling algorithm to select a subset of rows.

The resulting dataset has two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns, and is stratified to ensure a balanced representation of classes.
