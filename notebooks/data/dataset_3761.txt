QSAR-TID-11536 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Ghrelin Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Ghrelin Receptor. The Ghrelin Receptor is a single protein, also known as Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor, and it is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor.

The dataset has multiple features, including MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50, which are human-readable features. However, the rest of the features are FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are not human-readable.

The Ghrelin Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, spermatogenesis, female pregnancy, learning or memory, and response to hormone. It is also involved in the regulation of growth hormone secretion, response to food, and negative regulation of appetite.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, neuron projection, and synaptic membrane. It is also involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter receptor localization to postsynaptic specialization membrane and postsynaptic modulation of chemical synaptic transmission.
