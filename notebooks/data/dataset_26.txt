Nursery Database

This database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was used during several years in the 1980s when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family.

The hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure: Evaluation of Applications for Nursery Schools, which consists of Employment of Parents and Child's Nursery, Family Structure and Financial Standings, and Social and Health Picture of the Family. These concepts are further broken down into more specific categories, including Parents' Occupation, Child's Nursery, Form of the Family, Number of Children, Housing Conditions, Financial Standing of the Family, Social Conditions, and Health Conditions.

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (Nursery), the model includes four intermediate concepts: Employment, Family Structure and Financial Standings, Family Structure, and Social and Health Picture of the Family. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower-level descendants by a set of examples.

The Nursery Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates Nursery to the eight input attributes: parents, child's nursery, form of the family, number of children, housing conditions, financial standing, social conditions, and health conditions. Because of the known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

Class distribution is as follows: not recommended, recommended, very recommended, priority, special priority.

Features include: parents, child's nursery, form of the family, number of children, housing conditions, financial standing, social conditions, health conditions.

Keywords: nursery schools, hierarchical decision model, family structure, financial standing, social and health picture.
