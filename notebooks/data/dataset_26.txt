Nursery Database

Tags: study, uci

The Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was utilized for several years in the 1980s when there was excessive enrollment in these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and rejected applications frequently required an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family.

The model was developed within an expert system shell for decision making. The hierarchical model ranks nursery school applications according to a complex concept structure, including evaluation of applications, employment of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standings, and social and health picture of the family.

Input attributes include parents' occupation, child's nursery, form of the family, number of children, housing conditions, financial standing of the family, social conditions, and health conditions. The model includes several intermediate concepts: employment, structure and finances, family structure, and social and health factors.

The Nursery Database contains examples with the structural information removed, directly relating the nursery evaluation to eight input attributes: parents, has nursery, form, children, housing, finance, social, and health. Due to the known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

The dataset has no missing attribute values and includes a diverse class distribution. Attribute values encompass various categories for each input, such as usual, pretentious, or great pretentious for parents' occupation; proper, less proper, improper, critical, or very critical for child's nursery; and complete, completed, incomplete, or foster for family form.

This database offers a comprehensive view of factors considered in nursery school admissions, making it valuable for machine learning applications and decision-making studies.
