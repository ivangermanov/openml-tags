QSAR-TID-10473 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10473. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has 376 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is a Single Protein, specifically the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4, also known as CD184, CXCR4, CXC-R4, CXCR-4, and other synonyms. It is a membrane receptor, part of the Family A G protein-coupled receptor, Peptide receptor family, and Chemokine receptor.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 is involved in various biological processes, including response to hypoxia, neuron migration, epithelial cell development, dendritic cell chemotaxis, apoptotic process, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

It is also involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell migration, vascular wound healing, oligodendrocyte differentiation, neurogenesis, and viral process.

The receptor is a key player in the CXCL12-activated CXCR4 signaling pathway and is involved in the detection of temperature stimulus and mechanical stimulus involved in sensory perception of pain.
