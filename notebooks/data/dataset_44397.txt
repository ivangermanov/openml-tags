Magic Telescope Dataset Subsampling with Seed Zero

This dataset is a subsample of the Magic Telescope dataset, generated with a seed of zero. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns, as well as stratified sampling of rows.

The original dataset was reduced to a maximum of ten classes, and the classes were selected based on their frequency in the original dataset. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, retaining only the rows where one of these classes was present.

The dataset was further reduced to a maximum of one hundred columns, with the columns selected uniformly at random. The resulting dataset was then stratified sampled to a maximum of two thousand rows, with the stratification based on the class labels.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features and class labels, with the categorical columns converted to string format.
