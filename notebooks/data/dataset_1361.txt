QSAR-TID-100027 Tags: Meteorology, MTLQSAR, Physical Sciences, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tid one hundred twenty-seven, and it has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI fifty.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Circular FingerPrints one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, Extended Connectivity Circular FingerPrints one thousand twenty-four zero, Extended Connectivity Circular FingerPrints one thousand twenty-four one, Extended Connectivity Circular FingerPrints one thousand twenty-four two, ..., and nine hundred twenty-six more...
