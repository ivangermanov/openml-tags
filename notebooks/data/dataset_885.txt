Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on transplant-related information. The primary modification involves binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This conversion is achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean threshold. Instances with target values below the mean are classified as positive, denoted by 'P', while those at or above the mean are classified as negative, denoted by 'N'.

The dataset is associated with various study tags, suggesting its relevance to multiple research areas or experiments. It may be particularly useful for mythbusting exercises or comparative studies. The binarization process simplifies the original data, potentially making it more suitable for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that require binary classification.

Researchers utilizing this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately, acknowledging both the original source and the binarization process. The transformation from continuous to binary data may impact the granularity of information but can also provide clearer decision boundaries for classification tasks.
