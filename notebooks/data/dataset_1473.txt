MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 219, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. 

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
