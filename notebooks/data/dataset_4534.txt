This dataset sheds light on the important features that have proven to be sound and effective in predicting phishing websites. The lack of reliable training datasets has long been a challenge for researchers in this field. Although numerous articles have been published on predicting phishing websites, no reliable training dataset has been made publicly available due to the lack of consensus on the definitive features that characterize phishing web pages.

In this dataset, we propose some new features and highlight the importance of certain characteristics that have proven to be effective in identifying phishing websites. The attributes included in this dataset are crucial for developing accurate predictive models.

The dataset includes attributes such as having an IP address, URL length, use of shortening services, presence of "at" symbols, redirection through double slashes, prefix and suffix usage, subdomain existence, SSL final state, domain registration length, favicon presence, port usage, HTTPS token presence, request URL, anchor URL, links in tags, server form handler, submitting to email, abnormal URLs, redirects, mouseover effects, right-click functionality, popup windows, iframe usage, domain age, DNS records, web traffic, page rank, Google index, links pointing to pages, statistical reports, and results.

Relevant papers have been published on this topic, including an assessment of features related to phishing websites using automated techniques and predicting phishing websites based on self-structuring neural networks.
