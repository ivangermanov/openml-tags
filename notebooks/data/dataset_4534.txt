Data Set Information: One of the challenges faced by researchers in the field of phishing website prediction is the unavailability of reliable training datasets. This challenge is a major obstacle, as it is difficult to develop effective models without a comprehensive and reliable dataset. Although numerous articles have been published on predicting phishing websites, no reliable training dataset has been made publicly available. This is partly due to the lack of agreement in literature on the definitive features that characterize phishing web pages, making it difficult to shape a dataset that covers all possible features. In this dataset, we shed light on the important features that have proven to be sound and effective in predicting phishing websites. Additionally, we propose some new features that can enhance the accuracy of phishing website prediction models.

Attribute Information: For further information about the features, please refer to the features file in the data folder of UCI.
