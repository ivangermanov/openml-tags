QSAR-TID-10682 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10682. The dataset has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neuropeptide FF Receptor Two. This receptor is a single protein, also known as GPR seventy-four, and is a G-protein coupled receptor. It is a peptide receptor, specifically a short peptide receptor, and is involved in the neuropeptide signaling pathway.

The dataset features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and one thousand twenty-four FCFP six features, which are molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings. These features are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds.

The Neuropeptide FF Receptor Two is a membrane receptor, and is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of MAPK cascade, regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, and regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity.
