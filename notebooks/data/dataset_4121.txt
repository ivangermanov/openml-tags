QSAR-TID-10682 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10682. It has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, including FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four one, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four two, and so on.
