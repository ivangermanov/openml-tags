Name: Satellite Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Satellite with seed equal to three, arguments n rows max equal to two thousand, arguments n columns max equal to one hundred, arguments n classes max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, n rows max, n columns max, n classes max, and stratified as parameters. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. If the number of classes is greater than n classes max, it selects a subset of classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than n columns max, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of rows is greater than n rows max, it stratifies the data accordingly and subsets it. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subsetted data.
