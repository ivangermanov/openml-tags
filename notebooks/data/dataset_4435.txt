Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup Nine Up Selling with a specified seed value. This process involves generating a subset of the original dataset while maintaining its inherent characteristics.

The subsample function takes in several parameters, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to perform stratified sampling.

First, the function uniformly samples classes from the dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the specified maximum. It then selects the indices corresponding to the chosen classes and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, selecting only the specified maximum number of columns. This is done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

Finally, the function performs stratified sampling on the dataset to ensure that the resulting subset retains the same class distribution as the original dataset. The sampled data is then returned as a new dataset.

Features included in this subsampled dataset are: Var Six, Var Thirteen, Var Twenty One, Var Twenty Two, Var Twenty Four, Var Twenty Five, Var Twenty Eight, Var Thirty Five, Var Thirty Eight, Var Fifty Seven, Var Sixty Five, Var Seventy Three, Var Seventy Four, Var Seventy Six, Var Seventy Eight, Var Eighty One, Var Eighty Three, Var Eighty Five, Var One Oh Nine, Var One Twelve, Var One Thirteen, Var One Nineteen, Var One Twenty Three, Var One Twenty Five, Var One Twenty Six, Var One Thirty Two, Var One Thirty Three, Var One Thirty Four, Var One Forty, Var One Forty Four, Var One Forty Nine, Var One Fifty Three, Var One Sixty, Var One Sixty Three, Var One Ninety Four, Var One Ninety Six, Var Two Oh One, Var Two Oh Three, Var Two Oh Five, Var Two Oh Seven, Var Two Oh Eight, Var Two Ten, Var Two Eleven, Var Two Eighteen, Var Two Twenty One, Var Two Twenty Three, Var Two Twenty Five, Var Two Twenty Seven, Var Two Twenty Nine.
