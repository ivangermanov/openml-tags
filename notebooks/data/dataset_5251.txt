Cardiotocography 

The dataset consists of measurements of fetal heart rate and uterine contraction features on cardiotocograms classified by expert obstetricians. 

Features include Fetal Heart Rate Baseline, Number of Accelerations per Second, Number of Fetal Movements per Second, Number of Uterine Contractions per Second, Number of Light Decelerations per Second, Number of Severe Decelerations per Second, Number of Prolonged Decelerations per Second, Percentage of Time with Abnormal Short Term Variability, Mean Value of Short Term Variability, Percentage of Time with Abnormal Long Term Variability, Mean Value of Long Term Variability, Width of Fetal Heart Rate Histogram, Minimum of Fetal Heart Rate Histogram, Maximum of Fetal Heart Rate Histogram, Number of Histogram Peaks, Number of Histogram Zeros, Histogram Mode, Histogram Mean, Histogram Median, Histogram Variance, Histogram Tendency, and Fetal Heart Rate Pattern Class Code.

The dataset information includes two thousand one hundred twenty-six fetal cardiotocograms that were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The cardiotocograms were also classified by expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. 

Classification was performed with respect to a morphologic pattern and to a fetal state. Therefore, the dataset can be used either for ten-class or three-class experiments.

This dataset does not have missing values.

Additional variable information is provided, including definitions for each feature.
