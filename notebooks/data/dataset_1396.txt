This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor One, and it has a large number of rows and features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.
