The dataset kdd ipums la ninety seven small has been subsampled with a specific set of arguments to create a new dataset. This new dataset has been generated using a Python function called subsample, which takes several arguments including a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the original dataset, selecting a specified maximum number of classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the original data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the resulting dataset, selecting a specified maximum number of columns. If the resulting dataset still has more rows than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a specified maximum number of rows.

The resulting dataset is then returned with its corresponding metadata, including the categorical mask and column names. The categorical mask is necessary because some columns may contain categorical values that need to be treated specially.

The features of this dataset include various socioeconomic indicators such as household income, family size, number of children, occupation score, and poverty status, among others.
