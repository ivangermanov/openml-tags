The Concrete Slump dataset concerns the prediction of three properties of concrete - slump, flow, and compressive strength - as a function of the content of seven concrete ingredients. These ingredients include cement, fly ash, blast furnace slag, water, super plasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. This multivariate regression dataset aims to establish relationships between these ingredients and the resulting properties of concrete.

Features of this dataset include cement, slag, water, super plasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, slump in centimeters, flow in centimeters, and compressive strength in megapascals.

Keywords: Concrete Slump, multivariate regression, concrete ingredients, properties of concrete, cement, fly ash, blast furnace slag.
