Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Cols One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete with Seed Equal to Three arguments number rows maximum equal to Two Thousand arguments number columns maximum equal to One Hundred arguments number classes maximum equal to Ten arguments no stratify equal to False.

Generated with the following source code:

def subsample(self, seed, number rows max, number cols max, number classes max, stratified) -> Dataset:
random number generator = numpy random default random generator with seed
features = self features
target variable = self target variable

Uniformly sample classes equals target variable unique values
if length of classes is greater than number classes max:
value counts equals target variable value counts
selected classes equals random number generator choice of classes with size equal to number classes max replace false probability equals value counts divided by sum of value counts
Select the indices where one of these classes is present equals target variable index target variable is in selected classes
features equals features iloc select indices
target variable equals target variable iloc select indices

Uniformly sample columns if required
if length of features columns is greater than number cols max:
column indices equals random number generator choice of range of length features columns with size equal to number cols max replace false
sorted column indices equals sorted column indices
selected columns equals list of features columns sorted column indices
features equals features selected columns
else:
sorted column indices equals range of length features columns

if length of features is greater than number rows max:
Stratify accordingly
target name equals target variable name
data equals pandas concat of features and target variable along columns
_, subset equals train test split of data with test size equal to number rows max stratify equals data target name shuffle true random state equal to seed
features equals subset drop target name along columns
target variable equals subset target name

We need to convert categorical columns to string for OpenML
categorical mask equals list of self categorical mask for each index in sorted column indices
columns equals list of features columns

return Dataset technically this is not the same but it's where it was derived from 
dataset equals self dataset 
features equals features 
target variable equals target variable 
categorical mask equals categorical mask 
columns equals columns
