Data Description:
This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex Eur/Rub pair obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a one-hour candlestick period. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active on these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the Forex Eur/Rub pair's performance during each hourly period, including opening and closing prices, high and low prices, and trading volumes for both bid and ask sides.

Furthermore, the class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean close price of the subsequent hour relative to the mean close price of the current hour.
