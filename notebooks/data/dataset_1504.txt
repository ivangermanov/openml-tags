Steel Plates Fault Dataset

Tags: OpenML, study, OpenML

A dataset of steel plates' faults, classified into seven different types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition. The dataset consists of twenty-seven features describing each fault (location, size, and other characteristics) and seven binary features indicating the type of fault (one of seven: Pastry, Z Scratch, K Scratch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other Faults). The latter is commonly used as a binary classification target ('common' or 'other' fault).

The dataset was provided by a research center of sciences of communication in Rome, Italy. It is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data has been used in various studies and is part of the OpenML dataset collection.

This dataset is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition, especially those working on fault detection and classification in industrial settings. The diverse set of attributes allows for comprehensive analysis of steel plate faults, potentially leading to improved quality control processes in steel manufacturing.
