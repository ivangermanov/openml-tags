The QSAR-TID-20126 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin Two Receptor, also known as Neurokinin A Receptor, NK-Two R, or SKR Substance-K Receptor. It consists of one hundred eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature named Median PX Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprint Chemical Fragments, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Since generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, all bits were generated. 

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It includes various chemical compounds with their corresponding molecular fingerprints, which can be used for machine learning models to predict their activities on the Neurokinin Two Receptor.

The Neurokinin Two Receptor is a single protein and a member of the Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor group. It is primarily found in the plasma membrane and is involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to tachykinin receptors.
