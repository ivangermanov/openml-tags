Australian Electricity Demand

Tags: Australian Electricity Demand Forecasting Data, Half-Hourly Data

This dataset contains five time series representing the half-hourly electricity demand of five states in Australia: Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia. It was extracted from the R tsibbledata package. Unfortunately, the original data could not be found in the package or the original source.

The dataset consists of five columns: the identifier of a time series, the category or state of the time series, the value of the time series at a specific time step, the time step on the time series, and the reconstructed date of the time series in the format year-month-day hour-minute-second.

Preprocessing involved renaming columns, exploding the value column, creating a time step column from the exploded data, and creating a date column from the starting date and time step.

The dataset features include the identifier of a time series, the state, the value, the time step, and the date.
