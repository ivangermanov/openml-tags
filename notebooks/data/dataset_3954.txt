This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule Chembl Id and Median Px C Fifty. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from Smiles strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The data was obtained from the ChEMBL database, specifically from version seventeen. It is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen.

The target of this dataset is Adenosine A two b Receptor, also known as Adora two b. It belongs to the family of G protein coupled receptors and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell communication, and regulation of cell population proliferation.

The receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular responses to external stimuli. It is also involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity.

In addition to its physiological roles, the Adenosine A two b Receptor has been implicated in various diseases, including inflammation, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders.
