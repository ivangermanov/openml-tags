QSAR-TID-12854 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12854. The dataset has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Adenosine A2b receptor, which is a single protein target. The Adenosine A2b receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell communication, and response to stimulus.

The receptor is also known as Adora2b and is found in the plasma membrane, cell surface, and synapse. It plays a role in regulating cell population proliferation, vascular endothelial growth factor production, and norepinephrine secretion, among other processes.
