Machine Learning and Mathematics Subsampling of the QSAR Biodeg Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the QSAR Biodeg dataset generated using the following source code. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset.

The function takes several parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to perform stratified sampling. 

First, the function uniformly samples classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, the function selects a subset of classes based on their frequency distribution. It then selects the indices corresponding to these chosen classes.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the resulting dataset. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, the function randomly chooses a subset of column indices and reorders them to maintain consistency.

Finally, the function performs stratified sampling on the resulting dataset to ensure an even distribution of classes. It returns a new dataset object containing the subsampled data, along with metadata such as categorical masks and column names.
