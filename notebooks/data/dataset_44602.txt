Name: QSAR Biodeg Seed Four Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the QSAR Biodeg dataset with seed four

This dataset is a subsample of the QSAR Biodeg dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of columns, and then further subsampling the resulting dataset to meet the specified maximum number of rows.

The original dataset was filtered to include only a subset of classes, selected based on their frequency of occurrence. The classes were chosen using a random number generator, with the probability of selection proportional to their frequency in the original dataset. This ensured that the resulting dataset retained a representative distribution of classes.

The columns of the dataset were also subsampled, with a random selection of columns chosen to meet the specified maximum number of columns. The columns were selected without replacement, ensuring that the resulting dataset retained a diverse set of features.

Finally, the dataset was subsampled to meet the specified maximum number of rows. This was done using a stratified sampling approach, which ensured that the resulting dataset retained a representative distribution of classes.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of features, including V One, V Two, V Three, V Four, V Five, V Six, V Seven, V Eight, V Nine, V Ten, V Eleven, V Twelve, V Thirteen, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Sixteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, V Twenty-Two, V Twenty-Three, V Twenty-Four, V Twenty-Five, V Twenty-Six, V Twenty-Seven, V Twenty-Eight, V Twenty-Nine, V Thirty, V Thirty-One, V Thirty-Two, V Thirty-Three, V Thirty-Four, V Thirty-Five, V Thirty-Six, V Thirty-Seven, V Thirty-Eight, V Thirty-Nine, V Forty, V Forty-One, and Class.
