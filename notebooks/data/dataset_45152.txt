Insurance Bayesian Network. Sample Ten.

This network repository reference is available at bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, under the discrete medium category.

The Insurance Bayesian Network consists of twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point nineteen, while the average degree is around three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network is an adaptive probabilistic network with hidden variables, which enables it to model complex relationships between variables effectively.

The Insurance Bayesian Network features various attributes, including driving history, driving skill, age, ruggedness of automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft system, driving quality, risk aversion, good student discount, ownership of other cars, make and model, accident history, socioeconomic status, home base, property cost, car value, anti-lock braking system, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft, airbag, medical cost, senior training, and cushioning.
