Insurance Bayesian Network Sample. This Bayesian network is a sample from the bnlearn repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education. The Insurance Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium network, meaning it contains a mix of discrete and continuous variables.

The network consists of twenty-seven nodes, representing various factors that influence insurance policies, such as driving history, vehicle characteristics, and socioeconomic status. These nodes are connected by fifty-two arcs, which represent the probabilistic relationships between the variables. The network has a total of one thousand and eight parameters, which define the probability distributions of the variables.

The average Markov blanket size, a measure of the complexity of the network, is approximately five point one nine. The average degree, which represents the number of connections per node, is approximately three point eight five. The maximum in-degree, the maximum number of incoming connections to a node, is three.

This Bayesian network is a valuable resource for researchers and students working with probabilistic graphical models, particularly in the field of insurance and risk analysis.

Features of the network include driving history, driving skill, age, vehicle characteristics, and socioeconomic status.
