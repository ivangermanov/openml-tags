The QSAR-TID-102414 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102414. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and should be cited accordingly.

This dataset is related to the field of economics and life science, specifically focusing on molecular target identification.

The target protein is the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor one, also known as CysLTR one, CYSLTR one, cysteinyl leukotriene D four receptor, and LTD four receptor.

This protein belongs to the species group Cavia porcellus and is classified as a single protein, membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and leukotriene receptor.

The protein has multiple functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity and leukotriene receptor activity, and is involved in various biological processes, such as inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, calcium ion transport, chemotaxis, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, establishment of localization in cell, and leukotriene signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular target identification, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, inflammatory response.
