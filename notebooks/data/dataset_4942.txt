**Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample 1.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository provides access to a comprehensive repository of Bayesian networks, including the Mildew network.

This network has thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is four point five seven, and the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium network that has been extensively used in research studies.
