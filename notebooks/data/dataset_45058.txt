This dataset, Credit-G, classifies individuals described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. This dataset comes with a cost matrix, which indicates that it is worse to classify a customer as good when they are bad, than it is to classify a customer as bad when they are good. The cost of misclassification is not equal, with a higher penalty for misclassifying a bad credit risk as good.

The dataset includes a range of features that describe the individual, including the duration of the credit, the amount of credit, and the individual's installment commitment. It also includes information about the individual's residence, age, and employment status, as well as their credit history and other financial information.

The purpose of the dataset is to classify individuals as good or bad credit risks, with a focus on minimizing the cost of misclassification.

Keywords: credit risk, classification, cost matrix, misclassification, financial dataset.
