The Leukemia with Four Classes (Leukemia-4, AML-4) dataset is a collection of gene expression data used for molecular classification of cancer. This dataset is tagged with Geography and Microarray.

The dataset features a wide range of genes, including those related to biological processes such as cell signaling, metabolism, and DNA repair. These genes are represented by their corresponding probe set IDs, which are used to identify and quantify their expression levels.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of leukemia, enabling researchers to identify patterns and correlations between different genes and their roles in the development and progression of this complex disease.
