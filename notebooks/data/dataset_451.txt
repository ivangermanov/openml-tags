Relevant papers discussing this dataset include works on equality of opportunity in Irish schools, Bayes factors and model uncertainty, approximate Bayes factors for generalized linear models, and analyses of whether Irish education approaches the meritocratic ideal. These studies examined topics such as logistic analysis of educational outcomes, maximally maintained inequality, and the expansion, reform, and opportunity in Irish schools.
