This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-101607, falls under the categories of Life Science, Machine Learning, and MTL QSAR. It is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, which shows activity values of various compounds on a specific drug target, namely TID: 101607. There are eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features in total, including identifiers and a class feature known as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The generation process took place using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Notably, generating fingerprints typically does not require imputing missing values, as all bits are generated.

The features include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, along with multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, ranging from FCFP6_1024_0 to FCFP6_1024_1023.

Scraped data reveals information about the target protein, which is a single protein known as Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase thirty-two B. Its preferred name is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase thirty-two B, and its synonyms include STK thirty-two B, YANK two, and Yet Another Novel Kinase two. This protein belongs to the species Homo sapiens and falls under the classification of enzymes, kinases, and protein kinases, specifically within the AGC protein kinase group and the AGC protein kinase YANK family.

According to Expression Atlas, there is one piece of relevant data. Go Function lists eight functions associated with this protein, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, metal ion binding, and protein serine kinase activity. Furthermore, there are four biological processes linked to this protein, namely protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, and intracellular signal transduction.

Other relevant databases containing information about this protein include canSAR-Target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Tchem, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
