Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original census-related dataset. The primary modification involves the transformation of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with values below the mean are classified as positive, while those above are classified as negative.

The dataset includes several features, though their specific names are not provided in a human-readable format. These features likely represent various demographic and socioeconomic factors typically found in census data. The binary classification feature, labeled as 'binaryClass', serves as the target variable for potential machine learning or statistical analysis tasks.

This binarized version of the dataset may be particularly useful for researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems or those seeking to compare the performance of different algorithms on a simplified version of census data.
