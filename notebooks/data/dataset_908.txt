The Census Dataset has been binarized, converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process involved computing the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The resulting dataset comprises various features, including Column One, Column Two, Column Three, Column Four, Column Five, Column Six, and Column Seven, alongside the Binary Class.
