The RSCTC 2010 Dataset is a collection of example datasets for six different problems of DNA microarray data analysis and classification, characterized by values of twenty thousand to sixty-five thousand attributes. Each sample is assigned to several classes, ranging from two to ten. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA microarrays.

This dataset contains gene expression data, which is a crucial aspect of life science research. The data is ideal for chemistry and life science studies, particularly in the field of DNA microarray analysis.

The dataset features a large number of variables, including Var One, Var Two, Var Three, and so on, up to Var One Hundred. These variables are essential for understanding the complexities of DNA microarray data and its applications in chemistry and life science.

Keywords: DNA Microarray, Gene Expression, Chemistry, Life Science, Classification, Data Analysis.
