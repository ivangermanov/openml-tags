This dataset contains a simulation of the Lorenz Attractor with the parameter Rho varying in time, which leads to alternating periods of stable and chaotic regimes.

Features: x coordinate, y coordinate, z coordinate, Rho value

Keywords: Lorenz Attractor, Chaotic Regimes, Stable Regimes, Parameter Variation, Simulation Data
