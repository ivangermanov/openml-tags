This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred one thousand sixty-nine, and it has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR models and datasets for various drug targets. The dataset contains information about the Wee one-like protein kinase two, which is a single protein target belonging to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group/other protein kinase WEE family/other protein kinase WEE one subgroup.

Wee one-like protein kinase two is also known as WEE one B, Wee one B kinase, Wee one-like protein kinase one B, and WEE two. It is a protein target classified under the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group/other protein kinase WEE family/other protein kinase WEE one subgroup.

The protein target is described as being involved in various biological processes, including mitotic cell cycle, protein phosphorylation, female meiotic nuclear division, phosphorylation, female pronucleus assembly, positive regulation of phosphorylation, negative regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity, meiotic cell cycle, regulation of meiosis one, regulation of fertilization, and negative regulation of oocyte maturation.
