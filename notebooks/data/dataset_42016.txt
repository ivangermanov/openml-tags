Iris Dataset with Ignored Features Sepal Width and Petal Length 

This dataset focuses on computer systems and machine learning, specifically the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of features including sepal length, which is the length of the sepal of an iris flower, and petal width, which is the width of the petal of an iris flower. However, this particular instance of the Iris dataset ignores two key features: sepal width and petal length.
