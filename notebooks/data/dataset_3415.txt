QSAR-TID-101300 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101300. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

Cell Division Protein Kinase Eight is a single protein and is also known as Cyclin-dependent Kinase Eight, Mediator Complex Subunit CDK Eight, and other synonyms. It is an enzyme and a kinase that belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase CDK family.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, and the regulation of cell cycle.

It is also part of the mediator complex, which is required for the activation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase two.

The protein has ATP-binding and protein-serine/threonine kinase activities and is located in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, and nucleolus.

It interacts with other proteins, including cyclin C, cereblon, and RNA polymerase two, and is involved in various signaling pathways, including the Notch signaling pathway.
