QSAR-TID-101300 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101300. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the drug target TID: 101300.

The drug target TID: 101300 is also known as Cell Division Protein Kinase Eight, and is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell division and transcriptional regulation. It is a member of the CMGC protein kinase group and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and gene expression.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and test QSAR models, which can be used to predict the activity of compounds against this drug target.
