The Andromeda dataset is a multivariate regression data set concerning the prediction of future values for six water quality variables - temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, oxygen, and turbidity - in Thermaikos Gulf of Thessaloniki, Greece. These measurements of the target variables are taken from underwater sensors with a regular sampling interval, and then averaged to obtain a single measurement for each variable over each day.

The specific dataset used here corresponds to utilizing a window of five days, meaning feature attributes correspond to the values of the six water quality variables up to five days in the past, and a lead of five days, meaning predicting the values of each variable six days ahead.

This dataset consists of various features, including daily averages of water quality variables from previous days, which serve as inputs to predict the future values of these variables.

This dataset is particularly relevant in the context of government and health, as monitoring water quality is crucial for ensuring public health and safety, and can inform policy decisions related to environmental protection and conservation.
