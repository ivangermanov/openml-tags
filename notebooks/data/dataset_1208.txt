Name: BNG (Libras Move)
Tags: artificial, BNG
Features: x coordinate, y coordinate (repeated for multiple points)
Class

This dataset contains coordinate information for tracking hand movements in Brazilian Sign Language (Libras). It includes x and y coordinates for numerous points, likely representing the positions of hand and finger joints during sign language gestures. The data is structured to capture the motion trajectory of signs, with multiple coordinate pairs recorded over time. This type of dataset is commonly used in gesture recognition and sign language interpretation research, leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze and classify different signs based on their spatial patterns.
