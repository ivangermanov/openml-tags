AutoUniv Dataset 

Abstract:
The AutoUniv dataset is an advanced data generator for classification tasks, aiming to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. It provides flexibility in generating data in various formats, including CSV, ARFF, and C4.5.

Source:
The AutoUniv dataset was developed at the University of California, Irvine.

Data Set Information:
The AutoUniv dataset allows users to create a classification model and generate classified examples from it. To create a model, users specify the number of attributes and their type, the number of classes, the complexity of the underlying rules, and the noise level. The system then produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have multiple rules, and rare class models can be designed. Additionally, a sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. The system creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model, a user-friendly statement of the classification rules, and a statistical summary of the main properties of the model.

Attribute Information:
Attributes in the dataset may be discrete with multiple values or continuous. Discrete attributes can be nominal or integer.

Relevant Papers:
Research has been conducted on modeling the example life cycle in an online classification learner, handling concept drift in adaptive information systems, and the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift.
