The data are submitted on behalf of the Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, a recipient of National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award grant. 

The dataset represents ten years of clinical care at one hundred thirty United States hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over fifty features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the database for encounters that satisfied the following criteria: it is an inpatient encounter, that is, a hospital admission; it is a diabetic encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered to the system as a diagnosis; the length of stay was at least one day and at most fourteen days; laboratory tests were performed during the encounter; and medications were administered during the encounter.
