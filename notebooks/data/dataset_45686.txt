Description
Cylinder Bands UCI dataset - Process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction.

Attribute Information
There are forty attributes for five hundred forty observations, including the class: twenty are numeric and twenty are nominal. There are missing values in three hundred two of the instances.

The attributes include timestamp, cylinder number, customer, job number, grain screened, ink color, proof on cylinder type ink, blade manufacturer, cylinder division, paper type, ink type, direct steam, solvent type, type on cylinder, press type, press, unit number, cylinder size, paper mill location, plating tank, proof cut, viscosity, caliper, ink temperature, humidity, roughness, blade pressure, varnish percentage, press speed, ink percentage, solvent percentage, ESA Voltage, ESA Amperage, wax, hardener, roller durometer, current density, anode space ratio, chrome content, and band type.

Notes
Cylinder number is an identifier and should be ignored when modeling the data. The dataset consists of five hundred forty observations. UCI explanation states five hundred forty-one, which is incorrect.
