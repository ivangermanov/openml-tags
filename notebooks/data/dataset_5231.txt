The Simulated Video Transcoding dataset contains a collection of videos with various characteristics. For a detailed description, please refer to the GitHub repository.

This dataset features several attributes, including video duration, codec type, video resolution specified by width and height, bitrate, frame rate, and frame types comprising intra-coded, predicted, and bi-directionally predicted frames. Additionally, the dataset includes information on the number of frames, sizes of intra-coded and predicted frames, overall video size, and output attributes such as codec type, bitrate, frame rate, width, and height, along with user time.

Keywords: video transcoding, codec, resolution, bitrate, frame rate, video attributes.
