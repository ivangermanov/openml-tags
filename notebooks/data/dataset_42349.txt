This dataset presents usability, workload, time, and rate results of clinicians from our User Tests and Analysis Four study. The study focuses on understanding the performance of clinicians when using medical imaging software for breast cancer diagnosis.

The dataset includes features related to physician demographics, subjective usability scores, workload ratings, time taken to complete tasks, number of clicks, error rates, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scores.

This work was partially supported by national funds through the Foundation for Science and Technology and the Institute of Systems and Robotics through the UID/EEA/50009/2013 project and the BL89/2017-IST-ID grant.

The dataset is available on Kaggle and was originally published on March 3, 2018. Please cite the original publication: https://doi.org/10.1145/3399715.3399744
