This dataset presents usability, workload, time, and rates results of clinicians from our User Tests and Analysis Four study. The study aimed to investigate the usability and performance of medical imaging software in the context of breast cancer diagnosis.

The dataset includes results from two groups of clinicians: Single Mammography and Mammography. The features of the dataset include various metrics related to usability, workload, time, and rates. The usability metrics include the System Usability Scale (SUS) scores, which assess the ease of use and user satisfaction of the software. The workload metrics include the NASA-TLX scores, which evaluate the mental, physical, and temporal demands of the software on the clinicians. The time metrics include the time taken to complete tasks, and the rates metrics include the BIRADS scores, which assess the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and developers in the field of human-computer interaction and medical imaging, as it provides insights into the usability and performance of medical imaging software in real-world clinical settings.
