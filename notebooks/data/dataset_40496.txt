The LED Display Domain dataset is a simple domain containing seven boolean attributes and ten classes, representing the set of decimal digits. The dataset is inspired by LED displays, which contain seven light-emitting diodes, hence the reason for seven attributes. 

Each attribute represents one of the seven LEDs, with values of zero or one indicating whether the corresponding light is on or off for the decimal digit. However, each attribute value has a ten percent probability of being inverted, introducing noise into the dataset.

The class attribute is an integer representing the possible digits shown on the display. Without the noise, the problem would be straightforward, but the introduction of inverted values makes it more challenging.

Knowing the optimal Bayes rate for this database is valuable, and in this case, the misclassification rate is twenty-six percent, resulting in seventy-four percent classification accuracy.

Attribute information includes:

* Seven boolean attributes, each representing one of the seven LEDs
* Each attribute value has a ten percent chance of being inverted
* The class attribute is an integer ranging from zero to nine, inclusive

Scraped data provides additional information about the dataset:

* This simple domain contains seven boolean attributes and ten concepts, representing the set of decimal digits
* The problem would be easy without the introduction of noise, where each attribute value has a ten percent probability of being inverted
* Knowing the optimal Bayes rate for this database is valuable, and in this case, the misclassification rate is twenty-six percent, resulting in seventy-four percent classification accuracy

There are no missing values in the dataset.

Additional variable information explains that all attribute values are either zero or one, indicating whether the corresponding light is on or off for the decimal digit. Each attribute, excluding the class attribute, has a ten percent chance of being inverted.
