LED Display Domain Dataset

This simple domain contains seven Boolean attributes and ten classes, representing the set of decimal digits. Recall that LED displays contain seven light-emitting diodes, hence the reason for seven attributes. The class attribute is an integer, representing the possible digits shown on the display. The problem would be easy if not for the introduction of noise. In this case, each attribute value has a probability of having its value inverted, making it a challenging task.

The LED display data set is valuable to know the optimal Bayes rate for these databases. In this case, the misclassification rate is significant, resulting in a classification accuracy of seventy-four percent.

Attribute Information

The seven attributes, V one through V seven, represent each of the seven LEDs, with values either zero or one, according to whether the corresponding light is on or not for the decimal digit. Each attribute has a probability of being inverted, adding to the complexity of the problem.

Dataset Information

This simple domain contains seven Boolean attributes and ten concepts, the set of decimal digits. The problem would be easy if not for the introduction of noise. In this case, each attribute value has a probability of having its value inverted. It's valuable to know the optimal Bayes rate for these databases.

Additional Information

The dataset does not have missing values. All attribute values are either zero or one, according to whether the corresponding light is on or not for the decimal digit. Each attribute, excluding the class attribute, has a probability of being inverted.
