Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: This dataset contains numerous linguistic features, including common words and grammatical elements such as articles, prepositions, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. These features are used to analyze writing style and authorship. The dataset also includes a binary classification feature to distinguish between different classes of authorship.

The Analcatdata Authorship dataset is designed for studying and analyzing writing styles and authorship attribution. It provides a simplified binary classification approach to what was originally a multi-class problem. This conversion allows for more straightforward analysis and application of binary classification algorithms. The dataset's features focus on the frequency and usage of common words and grammatical structures, which are often indicative of an author's unique writing style.
