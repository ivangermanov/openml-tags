Pathfinder Bayesian Network Sample Five

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this network, which is a discrete very large network. 

This network has a number of nodes and a number of arcs, resulting in a total number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree provide insight into the network's structure. The maximum in-degree further characterizes the network.

Towards normative expert systems, part one of the Pathfinder project was published in a journal, providing further information on this network.

Features of this network include fault, as well as other characteristics.
