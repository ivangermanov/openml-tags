The Hepar2 Bayesian Network is a machine learning model that represents probabilistic relationships between various medical conditions and symptoms related to liver disorders. This network consists of seventy nodes, which represent different variables, and one hundred twenty-three arcs, which signify the dependencies between these variables.

The Hepar2 Bayesian Network has been widely used in medical diagnosis and research, particularly in the diagnosis of liver disorders. The network takes into account a range of factors, including symptoms such as anorexia, jaundice, and itching, as well as laboratory test results like triglyceride levels, amylase, and bilirubin.

The network also incorporates demographic information, such as age and sex, as well as lifestyle factors, including alcohol consumption and history of injections. Additionally, the network considers the presence of various diseases, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and carcinoma.

The Hepar2 Bayesian Network has been shown to be effective in predicting the probability of different liver disorders based on a patient's symptoms and test results. This can be useful in guiding diagnostic decisions and developing treatment plans.

The network is available in the bnlearn repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for machine learning and statistical modeling.
