Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample 10.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 

This Bayesian network is a representation of a complex system with a large number of nodes and arcs, showcasing the intricate relationships between various medical concepts.

The network consists of a substantial number of nodes, which are connected by a multitude of arcs, resulting in a vast number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes indicate a moderate level of complexity in the network.

The maximum in-degree of the nodes suggests that some nodes have a significant number of incoming connections, implying a high level of influence from other nodes in the network.

This Bayesian network is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of medicine, particularly in the diagnosis of liver disorders.
