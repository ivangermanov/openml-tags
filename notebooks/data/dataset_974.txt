GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets specifically designed for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets enable researchers to estimate various quality metrics, including accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from the growing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems. By utilizing these datasets, researchers can compare and evaluate different classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample included in the GEMLeR repository originates from the Expression Project for Oncology (expO), a large publicly available repository managed by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The resulting tumor data is updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions. This open-access approach translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Several factors contributed to the decision to utilize data from the expO repository, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the uniform use of the same microarray platform across all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the access to a large number of samples representing diverse tumor types.

When publishing materials based on GEMLeR datasets, researchers are kindly requested to acknowledge the assistance provided by this repository. This acknowledgment enables others to access the same datasets and replicate experiments.
