The German Credit dataset classifies individuals described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. This dataset comes with a cost matrix:

Good    Bad 
(predicted)
Good    0    1 
(actual)
Bad     5    0

It is worse to classify a customer as good when they are bad (five), than it is to classify a customer as bad when they are good (one).
