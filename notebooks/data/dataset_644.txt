The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Fri Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function includes five features for input and is as follows: y equals ten times sin of pi x one x two plus twenty times x three minus point five squared equals ten times X four plus five times X five plus e.

To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 

These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 

The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters are as follows: 

The number of features varies, with only the first five features being related to the output; the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples also varies. 

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the numbers of features are generated accordingly. 

The other datasets have varying numbers of features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
