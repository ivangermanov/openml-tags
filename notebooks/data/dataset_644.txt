This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes various features that are relevant to understanding cholesterol levels, including demographic information such as Age and Sex, as well as physiological measurements like Blood Pressure and Heart Rate.
