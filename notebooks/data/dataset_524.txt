Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

The dataset is found in an appendix of a book on Counting Processes and Survival Analysis. There are some minor differences from the original data: age is measured in days, status is coded differently, and some variables are not missing for certain observations.

This data comes from the Mayo Clinic trial on primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver, conducted over a ten-year period. The clinical background and recorded covariates are described in various medical publications. The study included patients who met eligibility criteria for a randomized placebo-controlled trial of a specific drug. Some participants were part of the randomized trial with complete data, while others consented to basic measurements and follow-up for survival without participating in the clinical trial.

The dataset contains information on hundreds of cases, with a small number lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis. Missing data items are denoted by a period. Variables included in the dataset are: case number, number of days between registration and outcome (death, transplantation, or study analysis), status, drug treatment, age, sex, presence of various symptoms (ascites, hepatomegaly, spiders, edema), and several medical measurements such as serum bilirubin, serum cholesterol, albumin, urine copper, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, triglycerides, platelets, prothrombin time, and histologic stage of disease.

The data is numeric in nature and includes various features related to patient characteristics, symptoms, and medical test results. This dataset provides valuable information for studying the progression and treatment outcomes of primary biliary cirrhosis.
