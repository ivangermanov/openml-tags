Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

The data set found in Appendix D of Counting Processes and Survival Analysis is used in this study. The only differences are: age is in days, status is coded as zero for censored, one for censored due to liver transplantation, and two for death. The sex and stage variables are not missing for observations three thirteen through four eighteen.

This data set contains information from the Mayo Clinic trial in Primary Biliary Cirrosis of the liver conducted between nineteen seventy-four and nineteen eighty-four. A description of the clinical background for the trial and the covariates recorded is provided. A more extended discussion can be found in relevant medical journals.

A total of four twenty-four Primary Biliary Cirrosis patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo-controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first three twelve cases in the data set participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data. The additional one twelve cases did not participate in the clinical trial, but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival. Six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so the data here are on an additional one six cases as well as the three twelve randomized participants. Missing data items are denoted by a period.

Variables include:

case number
number of days between registration and the earlier of death, transplantation, or study analysis time
status
drug
age in days
sex
presence of ascites
presence of hepatomegaly
presence of spiders
presence of edema
serum bilirubin
