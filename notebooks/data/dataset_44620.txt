Name: Car Subsample with Two Thousand Rows and Ten Classes Tags: Subsampling of the Car dataset with seed equal to two, generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The function uses random sampling to select the classes, columns, and rows. If the number of classes is greater than ten, the function selects ten classes randomly with a probability proportional to their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

If the number of columns is greater than one hundred, the function selects one hundred columns randomly. It then filters the data to include only these columns. If the number of rows is greater than two thousand, the function uses stratified sampling to select two thousand rows. The stratified sampling is done based on the target variable, which is the class label.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
