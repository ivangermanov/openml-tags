Monks Problems One

The Monks Problems were created during the Second European Summer School on Machine Learning, which took place in July nineteen ninety-one at the Corsendonk Priory. The attendees, consisting of monks from the priory, were overwhelmed by the vast array of machine learning algorithms presented during the event. They sought to find a way to compare these algorithms and determine which ones were optimal and which ones should be avoided.

As a result, they designed a simple task, known as the Monks Problems, to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms. The first problem, also referred to as Monk-One, involves a binary outcome based on a logical formula. This formula states that either attribute one equals attribute two, or attribute five equals one.

This dataset combines the original training and test sets, allowing for alternative sampling procedures. The original train-test splits can still be accessed through one of the OpenML tasks.

Attribute Information:

* Attribute One: takes on values one, two, or three
* Attribute Two: takes on values one, two, or three
* Attribute Three: takes on values one or two
* Attribute Four: takes on values one, two, or three
* Attribute Five: takes on values one, two, three, or four
* Attribute Six: takes on values one or two

Additional Information:

The Monks Problems served as the foundation for the first international comparison of machine learning algorithms. The outcome of this comparison is summarized in a technical report. One notable aspect of this comparison is that it was conducted by a group of researchers, each advocating for the technique they tested. This approach reduces bias and provides a more accurate reflection of the generalization behavior of the learning techniques when applied by knowledgeable users.

There are three Monks Problems, all sharing the same domain. One of the problems includes added noise. Each problem has been divided into a training and test set.
