The Child Bayesian Network is a sample network that represents a probabilistic model for diagnosing diseases in children. It consists of twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with two hundred thirty parameters and an average Markov blanket size of three. The average degree of the network is two point five, with a maximum in-degree of two.

This network was developed using the bnlearn repository, which provides a comprehensive collection of Bayesian networks for research and educational purposes. The Child Bayesian Network is a discrete medium-sized network that demonstrates the application of Bayesian inference in medical diagnosis.

The network includes various features such as Hypothesis Distribution, Duct Flow, Cardiac Mixing, Disease, Lung Flow, Carbon Dioxide Report, Hypoxia in Oxygen, X-ray Report, Age, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, Lower Body Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Chest X-ray, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Report, Birth Asphyxia, Grunting Report, Grunting, Sickness, Lung Parenchyma, and Right Upper Quadrant Oxygen.
