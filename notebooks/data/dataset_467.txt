The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets. The dataset names are coded to indicate the level of colinearity and the number of samples and features. 

These datasets were originally designed to test the performance of stochastic gradient boosting algorithms. They include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, with a normalized noise term added to the output.

The Friedman function, which generates these datasets, includes five input features. To test the effect of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These extra features are independent of the output variable. 

To evaluate an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with varying levels of collinearity. Collinearity refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in terms of the number of features, samples, and collinearity degrees. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output variable. The remaining features are randomly generated and unrelated to the output.

The number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand. The collinearity degrees range from zero to four, indicating the number of features that depend on other features. 

In total, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying these three parameters. Each dataset has a target attribute, which is the last column in each file.
