This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero two nine eight eight, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains information about a single protein preferred name Cathepsin B like cysteine protease, also known as Cathepsin B like cysteine protease, from the organism Trypanosoma brucei. 

The protein target classification is one point enzyme forward slash protease forward slash cysteine protease forward slash cysteine protease CA clan forward slash cysteine protease C one A family. 

Description Relationship Accession Cathepsin B like cysteine protease Single Protein.
