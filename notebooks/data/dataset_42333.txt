SoilHydroDB Tags: clay, hydrology, saturated hydraulic conductivity, sand, soil, soil texture

Global soil hydraulic properties for geoscience applications, including saturated hydraulic conductivity, water content at thirty-three kilopascals and less than two millimeters, and water content at one thousand five hundred kilopascals and less than two millimeters. A total of measurements were assembled from published literature and other sources, undergoing standardization and quality checks.

Features include site key, site observation date, longitude in decimal degrees, latitude in decimal degrees, laboratory sample number, layer sequence, horizon top, horizon bottom, horizon designation, and more.

This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of soil hydraulic properties, essential for understanding soil behavior and its impact on the environment. The data can be used to analyze soil texture, composition, and structure, as well as its hydrological properties, making it a valuable resource for geoscientists and researchers.
