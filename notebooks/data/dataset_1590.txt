Dataset Information:
This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was originally extracted from the Census database. The prediction task is to determine whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000. The dataset contains reasonably clean records extracted using specific conditions related to age, adjusted gross income, final weight, and hours worked per week.

The dataset includes both training and test sets merged into a single file. It contains various demographic and employment-related features, with the target variable being income level (over or under $50,000 per year).

Variable Description:
Most variables are self-explanatory, except for "final weight" (fnlwgt). This variable serves as a proxy for demographic background, with the assumption that individuals sharing similar demographic characteristics should have comparable weights. However, this similarity does not transfer across different states.

The final weight is derived from independent estimates of the civilian non-institutional population of the United States, prepared monthly by the Census Bureau's Population Division. Three sets of controls are used in the weighting program: state-level population estimates for individuals aged 16 and older, controls for Hispanic origin by age and sex, and controls by race, age, and sex.

Features:
The dataset includes features such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country. The target variable is the income class (over or under $50,000 per year).

Missing Values:
The dataset contains missing values.

Additional Information:
The original data was extracted using specific conditions to ensure reasonably clean records. The dataset has been used in various studies and is part of the OpenML collection.

Relevant Papers:
A paper on data mining and visualization related to this dataset has been published, focusing on scaling up the accuracy of Naive-Bayes classifiers using a decision-tree hybrid approach.
