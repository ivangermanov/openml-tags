The QSAR-TID-101503 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 101503. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. These features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. 

The drug target is a single protein, specifically the NUAK family SNF1-like kinase two, also known as omphalocele kinase two or OMPHK two. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CAMK protein kinase group, CAMK protein kinase CAMK one family, and CAMK protein kinase NuaK subfamily. 

It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, phosphorylation, actin cytoskeleton organization, negative regulation of TOR signaling, protein localization to nucleus, regulation of hippo signaling, intracellular signal transduction, cellular response to glucose starvation, and negative regulation of apoptotic process.
