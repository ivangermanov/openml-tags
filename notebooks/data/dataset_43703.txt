Context 
Pantheon is a project celebrating the cultural information that endows our species with fantastic capacities. To celebrate our global cultural heritage, we are compiling, analyzing, and visualizing datasets that can help us understand the process of global cultural development. 

Content 
The Pantheon data measures the global popularity of historical characters using two measures. The simpler of the two measures, which we denote as a language score, is the number of different Wikipedia language editions that have an article about a historical character. The more sophisticated measure, which we name the Historical Popularity Index, corrects the language score by adding information on the age of the historical character, the concentration of page views among different languages, the variation in page views, and the number of page views in languages other than English.
