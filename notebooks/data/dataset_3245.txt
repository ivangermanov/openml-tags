The QSAR-TID-10701 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10701. This dataset has 125 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The data shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Methionine Aminopeptidase One, which is a single protein preferred name. It is also known as Map One, Metap One, and Peptidase M One.

Methionine Aminopeptidase One is an enzyme/protease/metallo protease/metallo protease MG clan/metallo protease M24A subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, negative regulation of gene expression, protein processing, and protein modification process.

This protein is located in the cytoplasm, cytosol, and cytoplasmic stress granule. It is also associated with various molecular functions, including mRNA binding, aminopeptidase activity, initiator methionyl aminopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, and metalloaminopeptidase activity.
