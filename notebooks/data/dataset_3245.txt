QSAR-TID-10701 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10701. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10701. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists who want to study the activity of compounds on drug target TID: 10701.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The drug target is Methionine Aminopeptidase One, which is a single protein and an enzyme or protease or metallo protease or metallo protease MG clan or metallo protease M24A subfamily.

The dataset also contains information about the gene ontology, including component, function, and process. The gene ontology information includes cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoplasmic stress granule, and cytosolic ribosome. The function includes mRNA binding, aminopeptidase activity, initiator methionyl aminopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. The process includes proteolysis, negative regulation of gene expression, protein processing, and protein modification process.

The dataset also contains cross-references to other databases, including canSAR-Target, IntAct, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro.
