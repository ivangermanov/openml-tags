The project's goal is to utilize this dataset to predict the level of success game developers should expect given their game design details. Features such as whether the game was developed by an independent studio, whether the game was noted for its soundtrack, and the genres of the game, will be able to predict the popularity of the game.

The content was gathered by performing a thorough scrape of the Steam store, from most popular to least popular, which is evident in the correlation between the index and the presence value, which represents the number of online posts related to the game. During the scraping process, each game was supplemented by calling the RAWG API and adding additional features.

The main inspiration behind this dataset was to gain and share the importance of each of the features related to game success on the Steam store. This information could be valuable for game developers, and it would also be interesting to create a game using the insights gained, to evaluate the accuracy of the models.

Features include Game Name, RAWG ID, Steam URL, Metacritic Score, Genres, Independent Studio, Presence, Platform, Graphics, Storage, Memory, Ratings Breakdown, Release Date, Soundtrack, Franchise, Original Cost, Discounted Cost, Number of Players, Controller Support, Languages, ESRB Rating, Achievements, Publisher, Game Description, and Tags.
