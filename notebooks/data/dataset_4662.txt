Wine Quality White Dataset Subsampling 

Machine Learning, Mathematics

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Wine Quality White dataset. It was generated using a specific set of parameters, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratification option.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset until the desired number of classes was reached. Then, the indices where one of these classes was present were selected, and the corresponding data points were retained. 

If necessary, the columns were also uniformly sampled until the desired number of columns was reached. The remaining data points were then split into a subset based on the specified maximum number of rows, ensuring that the class distribution was maintained through stratification.

The resulting dataset consists of various features, including V One, V Two, V Three, V Four, V Five, V Six, V Seven, V Eight, V Nine, V Ten, V Eleven, and Class.
