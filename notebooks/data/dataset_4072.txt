The QSAR-TID-30030 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30030. This dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID three thousand thirty.

The computational universe and computer systems played a crucial role in generating this dataset. The molecular fingerprints were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, which is a powerful tool for generating molecular descriptors. The FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor that captures the structural information of molecules.

This dataset is useful for researchers who want to study the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. The activity values are measured in terms of pseudo-pCI fifty, which is a unit of measurement that represents the negative logarithm of the concentration of a compound required to produce a certain effect.

The dataset also includes information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, and classification. The drug target is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group/other protein kinase NEK family.
