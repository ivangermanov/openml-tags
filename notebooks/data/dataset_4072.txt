QSAR-TID-30030 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30030. The dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30030. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 30030, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase NEK nine is a protein that belongs to the NEK family of protein kinases. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, mitotic cell cycle, and protein phosphorylation. The protein is also known to interact with other proteins, such as NIMA-related kinase nine, and is involved in the regulation of mitotic cell cycle.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for the serine/threonine-protein kinase NEK nine. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data, which can be used to develop and validate QSAR models.
