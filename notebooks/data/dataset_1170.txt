The Twonorm dataset is an implementation of a twenty-dimensional, two-class classification example. Each class is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with unit variance. One class has a mean where all values are equal to a certain value, whereas the other class has a mean where all values are equal to the negative of that certain value. 

This dataset is particularly interesting because it has been reported that the theoretical expected misclassification rate for this dataset is very low, specifically around two point three percent. In practice, however, when using three hundred training examples with a specific decision tree learning algorithm called CART, the error rate was much higher, at twenty-two point one percent.

The dataset consists of twenty features, although they have not been given descriptive names.
