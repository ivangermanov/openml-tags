This dataset, named QSAR-TID-20067, contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data related to economics and life science, specifically the MetaQSAR project from September 2015. It consists of twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecular identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Convolutional Filters (FCFP) 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Since generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, all bits were generated.

The dataset includes a molecule Chembl identifier and multiple FCFP features. 

The molecule Chembl identifier corresponds to a specific molecule, while the FCFP features describe the molecular structure and properties.

The dataset is related to the drug target TID: 20067, which refers to the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type One Protease. 

This enzyme is responsible for various biological processes, including proteolysis, viral process, suppression by virus of host translation, and suppression by virus of host gene expression.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, FCFP, molecular fingerprints, SMILES, Pipeline Pilot, Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type One Protease, proteolysis, viral process.
