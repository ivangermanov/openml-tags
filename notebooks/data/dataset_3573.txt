QSAR-TID-20067 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20067. The dataset has twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20067. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The dataset contains information about the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type I Protease, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as Capsid Protein p24 gag-pro, Gag-Pro Polyprotein, Matrix Protein p19, and NC'. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, viral process, suppression by virus of host translation, and suppression by virus of host gene expression.

The dataset provides information about the protein's function, including its role in nucleic acid binding, aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, structural molecule activity, peptidase activity, zinc ion binding, and metal ion binding. The dataset also provides information about the protein's component, including its role in viral nucleocapsid, viral capsid, and virion component.
