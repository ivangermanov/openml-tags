The QSAR-TID-100155 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, tagged under Earth Science, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100155.

This dataset has 138 rows and 1026 features, including molecule ChEMBL IDs and class feature: median pXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL IDs and various fingerprint features, such as FCFP6 1024 0, FCFP6 1024 1, FCFP6 1024 2, and so on.

The target protein is ADAM10, also known as Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain-Containing Protein 10. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme/protease/metallo protease/metallo protease MAM clan/metallo protease M12B subfamily.

ADAM10 has various synonyms, including ADAM 10, CD156c, CDw156, and Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain-Containing Protein 10. Its description is related to single protein preferred name and synonyms.

The dataset also includes information about the protein target classification, description, relationship, accession, and organism. Additionally, it provides details about expression atlas, go components, go functions, go processes, and other related data.
