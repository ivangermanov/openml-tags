Wine Reviews 

Tags: Manufacturing, Social Media 

This dataset consists of one hundred thirty thousand wine reviews, each featuring a range of attributes including the type of grape used, the location where it was produced, the winery responsible, the price point, and a brief description. 

The data was sourced from Kaggle, where it was originally uploaded, and stems from a web scraping exercise conducted on the Wine Enthusiast website. The second iteration of this dataset was utilized, which was compiled on November twenty-second, two thousand seventeen. 

The dataset is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike four point zero International license. 

The target variable for this dataset is the points awarded to each wine, as rated by Wine Enthusiast on a scale of one to one hundred. 

A full description of each variable can be found on the Kaggle repository page. 

By default, the region two variable is excluded due to its high proportion of missing values. Similarly, the designation variable is not utilized by default, owing to the vast number of factor labels present relative to the number of observations. 

In addition to the numerical attributes, the dataset also encompasses text-based variables, namely the description, taster Twitter handle, and title, although the latter is ignored by default. These text features have been preprocessed to remove special characters, thereby facilitating their upload to the platform. 

The ID variable present in the original Kaggle dataset has been removed from this iteration. Furthermore, the factor labels associated with nominal features were converted into integers to overcome an issue preventing the upload of nominal features featuring excessively lengthy labels.
