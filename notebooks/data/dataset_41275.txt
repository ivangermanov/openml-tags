Wine Reviews dataset contains one hundred thirty thousand wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle on twenty-ninth of October two thousand eighteen. The original data was scraped from the Wine Enthusiast homepage, which is a well-known online platform for wine enthusiasts. The second version of the dataset was used, which was scraped on twenty-second of November two thousand seventeen. The Kaggle dataset was licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike Four Point Zero International, which allows users to share and adapt the material for non-commercial purposes.

The variable points, which represents the number of points Wine Enthusiast rated the wine on a scale of one to one hundred, was selected as the target variable. For a detailed description of all variables, please refer to the Kaggle dataset repository. The variable region two is ignored by default as it contains a large portion of missing values. The variable designation is not used by default, as the number of factor labels is extremely high compared to the number of observations.

The dataset further includes the text-based variables description, taster twitter handle, and title, which could be used to construct additional features. Special characters in text features have been removed to allow the upload to the platform. The ID variable from the Kaggle version was removed from the dataset. The factor labels of all nominal features had to be changed to integers to prevent a problem that would not allow the upload of nominal features with too many and too long labels.

The dataset features include country, description, designation, points, price, province, region one, region two, taster name, taster twitter handle, title, variety, and winery.
