QSAR-TID-101036 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101036. The dataset has twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Prostasin, also known as Channel-activating Protease one. Prostasin is a single protein, and it is a serine protease that belongs to the PA clan and S one A subfamily. It is involved in proteolysis and positive regulation of sodium ion transport.

The dataset features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and nine hundred twenty-six more features that represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

Prostasin is a protein that is expressed in Homo sapiens, and it is classified as an enzyme, protease, and serine protease. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and positive regulation of sodium ion transport. It is also associated with various cellular components, including extracellular region, extracellular space, plasma membrane, and membrane.
