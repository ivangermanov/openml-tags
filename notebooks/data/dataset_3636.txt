The QSAR-TID-101036 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101036. This dataset has twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101036. The features do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many others representing FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints. These features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

This dataset is related to Prostasin, a single protein also known as CAP one Channel-activating Protease one. It is a serine protease, and its synonyms include Prostasin Heavy Chain, Prostasin Light Chain, and others. The organism is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group No Protein Target Classification.

Prostasin is classified as an enzyme, protease, and serine protease, belonging to the Serine Protease PA Clan and Serine Protease S one A Subfamily. Its expression atlas shows relationships with extracellular regions, extracellular spaces, plasma membranes, membranes, and extracellular exosomes. Its functions include serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.
