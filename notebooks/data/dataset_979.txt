Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi class target feature is converted to a two class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: [List of features omitted for brevity]

This dataset is a modified version of an original waveform dataset. The primary modification involves converting the multi class target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as positive and grouping all other classes as negative. The dataset is intended for use in mythbusting and various studies related to machine learning and data analysis. It contains numerous features that describe waveform characteristics, though the specific nature of these features is not detailed in the provided information.

The original source and date of creation for this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper citation and acknowledgment when using this data for research or analysis purposes. Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should be aware of its binary classification structure and the potential implications this may have on their analyses and results.
