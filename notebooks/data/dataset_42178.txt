The Telco-Customer-Churn dataset is designed to predict behavior and retain customers by analyzing all relevant customer data and developing focused customer retention programs.

Each row in the dataset represents an individual customer, while each column contains attributes describing various aspects of the customer. The dataset provides valuable insights into customers who have left within the last month, which is indicated by the column titled Churn.

Additionally, the dataset offers information about the services each customer has subscribed to, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, technical support, and streaming television and movie services.

Customer account details are also included, encompassing the length of time they have been a customer, their contract terms, preferred payment methods, whether they opt for paperless billing, and both monthly and total charges.
