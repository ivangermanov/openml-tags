Tags: Context Predict Behavior to Retain Customers

The Telco Customer Churn dataset is designed to help predict behavior and retain customers. By analyzing all relevant customer data, you can develop focused customer retention programs. Each row in the dataset represents a customer, and each column contains customer attributes described in the column metadata.

The dataset includes information about customers who have left within the last month, which is indicated by the Churn column. It also includes details about the services each customer has signed up for, such as phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

Additionally, the dataset provides customer account information, including how long they have been a customer, their contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges. Demographic information about customers is also included, such as gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.

This dataset is ideal for exploring models that predict customer churn and learning more about the subject.
