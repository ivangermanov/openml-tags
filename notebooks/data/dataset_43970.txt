The KDD IPUMS LA Ninety Seven Small dataset is categorized under Machine Learning and Medicine, and is utilized in the Tabular Data Benchmark. This dataset falls under the classification on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset has undergone transformation in a similar manner as described in the GitHub repository by Leo Grin. The original description of this dataset remains unclear, with unknown authors and sources.

A binarized version of the original dataset has been created, where the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as positive and all other classes as negative.

The dataset consists of various features, including value, rent, total income, mother's location, family size, number of children, elderly children, young children, number of siblings, age, occupation score, socioeconomic index, total income, wage income, business income, farm income, social security income, welfare income, other income, poverty level, and a binary classification feature.
