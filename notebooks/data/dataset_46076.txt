AIDS Virus Infection Prediction

The AIDS Classification dataset is a comprehensive resource specifically compiled for researchers and healthcare professionals focusing on the statistical analysis of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. Composed of a large number of instances, this dataset encapsulates a broad spectrum of clinical and demographic variables related to AIDS patients. Each record in the dataset holds data across multiple columns, indicating various patient attributes including treatment details, demographic information, clinical test results, and disease progression indicators.

Attribute Description:

Time Since Baseline Measurement indicates the time elapsed since the initial measurement, in days. Treatment Code signifies different treatment regimens. Age of the Patient is recorded in years. Weight of the Patient is measured in kilograms. Presence of Hemophilia indicates whether the patient has hemophilia or not. Homosexual Behavior indicates whether the patient has engaged in homosexual behavior or not. Drug Use indicates whether the patient has used drugs or not. Karnofsky Score indicates the patient's functional impairment, ranging from zero to one hundred. Number of Opportunistic Infections Prior to Study indicates the number of infections the patient had before the study. Presence of Z30 Gene indicates whether the patient has the Z30 gene or not. Months Before Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy indicates the time elapsed before the patient received antiretroviral therapy. Race indicates the patient's race, either non-white or white. Gender indicates the patient's gender, either female or male. Stratification Variable Two and Overall Stratification are additional variables used for stratification. Presence of Specific AIDS-Related Symptoms indicates whether the patient has shown specific symptoms or not. Treatment Response indicates whether the patient responded to treatment or not. Off Treatment indicates whether the patient is off treatment or not. CD4 Count at Baseline, CD4 Count at Twenty Weeks, CD4 Count at Eight Weeks, and CD4 Count at Twenty Weeks Post the Eight-Week Measurement are all indicators of the patient's CD4 count at different time points. HIV Infection Status indicates whether the patient is HIV positive or negative.

Use Case:

This dataset is designed to facilitate a range of scientific inquiries, including the evaluation of treatment efficacy, the identification of prognostic factors for disease progression, and the development of predictive models for patient outcomes. By encompassing a rich variety of data points, the AIDS Classification dataset supports detailed statistical analyses and machine learning efforts aimed at enhancing our understanding of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. It can particularly serve in the optimization of treatment protocols and in the advancement of targeted therapies, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and management strategies in the field of AIDS research.
