This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Neurokinin One Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
