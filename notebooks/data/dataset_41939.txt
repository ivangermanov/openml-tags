PAR Ten Classification Dataset 

This dataset is related to Algorithm Selection, Health, and Medicine. It contains the PAR Ten performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of Mixed Integer Programming Library Two Thousand and Ten. 

The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the twelve threads table of the evaluations. The features were generated using the Mixed Integer Programming feature computation code. 

To record runtimes of the feature computations, Run Solver was used. This dataset is part of the Open Algorithm Challenge Two Thousand and Seventeen, also known as Mira.

Features include problem type, number of variables, number of constraints, number of non-zero coefficients, number of quadratic variables, number of quadratic constraints, average linear programming value, average linear programming L two norm value, linear programming L infinity norm value, linear programming objective value, number of binary variables, number of integer variables, number of continuous variables, number of semi-continuous variables, number of non-negative variables, ratio of binary variables, ratio of integer variables, ratio of continuous variables, ratio of semi-continuous variables, ratio of non-negative variables, number of implicit integer variables, ratio of implicit integer variables, number of unbounded discrete variables, ratio of unbounded discrete variables, average support size, median support size, variance coefficient of support size, ninth decile minus first decile support size, right-hand side constant zero average, variance coefficient of right-hand side constant zero, right-hand side constant one average, variance coefficient of right-hand side constant one, right-hand side constant two average, variance coefficient of right-hand side constant two, variable constraint graph constraint degree zero average, median variable constraint graph constraint degree zero, variance coefficient of variable constraint graph constraint degree zero, ninth decile minus first decile variable constraint graph constraint degree zero, and many more.
