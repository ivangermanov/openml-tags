PAR10 Classification Dataset

This dataset is part of the Open Algorithm Challenge and focuses on Algorithm Selection. It contains the PAR10 performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of MIPLIB2010. The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the evaluations of the solvers. The features were generated using the MIP feature computation code, and the runtimes of the feature computations were recorded using runsolver.

The dataset includes a wide range of features, including problem type, number of variables, number of constraints, number of non-zero coefficients, and various statistics related to the linear programming relaxation, such as the average and variance of the coefficients, and the objective value. Additionally, it includes features related to the variable and constraint graph, such as the degree and weight of the variables and constraints, and the support size and variance of the coefficients.

The dataset is designed to help researchers and practitioners develop and evaluate algorithms for solving mixed-integer linear programming problems.
