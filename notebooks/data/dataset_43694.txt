Smogon Six versus Six Pokémon Tiers

This dataset stems from a popular Pokémon dataset, listing the tiered Pokémon in Smogon Six versus Six, one of the most popular formats for competitive Pokémon. Although it is not the official competitive format, there is still a significant number of people who play this format. There are a number of tiers of Pokémon in which people can play, the most popular being Overused. This dataset seeks to display both a Pokémon's stats and corresponding tier for easier competitive analysis.

In addition to the addition of the Tier variable, there are several other changes made to the set: Mythical Pokémon are classified as Legendary; the naming convention of Mega Evolutions and some form changes have been changed; and the Mega tier has been added to signify Mega Evolutions. Note that this dataset includes only Pokémon tiered from Pure Uncut to Anything Goes. Not Fully Evolved and Little Cup Pokémon are not included unless they appear in Smogon's list.

The list of which Pokémon are in which tier was found on the Smogon website. This dataset includes the following features: Pokémon name, type one, type two, total stats, hit points, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed, generation, legendary status, and mega evolution status.
