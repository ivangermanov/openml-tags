QSAR-TID-61 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 61. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. The data was obtained from ChEMBL version 17 and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints can be used to predict the activity of compounds on a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop predictive models of drug activity. By using the molecular fingerprints in the dataset, researchers can train machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds on the TID: 61 drug target.

The dataset is part of a larger collection of QSAR data, which can be used to develop predictive models of drug activity. The data has been carefully curated and processed to ensure that it is of high quality and can be used for a variety of applications.
