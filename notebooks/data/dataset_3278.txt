QSAR-TID-61 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID sixty-one. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September two thousand fifteen. 

It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID sixty-one. 

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Data was scraped from various sources, including Chembl twenty-one sixty, which shows type as single protein, preferred name as Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M one, synonyms as CHRM one Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M one, organism as Homo sapiens, species group as no, protein target classification as one point membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor small molecule receptor family A GPCR monoamine receptor acetylcholine receptor.
