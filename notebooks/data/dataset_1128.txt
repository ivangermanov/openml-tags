GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating diverse quality metrics, including accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among others, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

This repository was inspired by an escalating need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a unified collection of microarray classification problems that could be leveraged by disparate researchers. Consequently, numerous classification or feature selection techniques can now be compared to one another on the same set of problems.

The origin of the data lies in the large, publicly accessible Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository, which is maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is subsequently updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain sans intellectual property restrictions. This accessibility translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Although multiple sources of gene expression data are available, the decision to utilize data from the expO repository was driven by several key factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the uniformity of the microarray platform employed for all samples, the availability of supplementary information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the presence of a large number of samples for disparate tumor types.
