Squash Harvest Unstored Data 

The purpose of the research was to determine the changes taking place in squash fruit during the maturation and ripening process, so as to pinpoint the best time to harvest the fruit to ensure it reaches the marketplace in optimal condition, specifically for the Japanese market. The squash is transported to Japan by refrigerated cargo vessels, which takes approximately three to four weeks, and evaluations were carried out at two stages: one representing the quality inspection stage prior to export, and another at the stage it would reach upon arrival at the marketplace.

The original objectives of the study were to identify which pre-harvest variables contribute to good-tasting squash after different periods of storage time. This is determined by evaluating the acceptability of the fruit, categorized as either unacceptable, acceptable, or excellent.
