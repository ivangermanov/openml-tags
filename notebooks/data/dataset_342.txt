The relationship between Intelligence Quotient and Brain Size 

Monozygotic twins share numerous physical, psychological, and pathological traits, which has led researchers to investigate the similarity in neuroanatomical characteristics among them. With recent advances in in vivo brain image acquisition and analysis, it has become possible to quantify whether twins share neuroanatomical traits and if these measures correlate with brain size. 

Using magnetic resonance imaging and computer-based image analysis techniques, measurements of the volume of the forebrain, the surface area of the cerebral cortex, and the mid-sagittal area of the corpus callosum were obtained in ten pairs of monozygotic twins. Additionally, head circumference, body weight, and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient were also measured. 

Analyses of variance were carried out using genotype, birth order, and sex as between-subject factors. Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the interrelationships between brain measures, head circumference, and Intelligence Quotient. 

The results showed that there were effects of genotype on total forebrain volume, total cortical surface area, and callosal area. Consistent with previous twin studies, highly significant effects of genotype but not birth order were also found for head circumference, body weight, and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient. 

Moreover, the significant effect of genotype on all measures was not attributable to sex differences across unrelated twin pairs. Significant correlations were observed between forebrain volume, cortical surface area, and callosal area, as well as between each brain measure and head circumference. However, no correlation between Intelligence Quotient and any other measure was found. 

In conclusion, monozygotic twins share similarities in forebrain volume, cortical surface area, and callosal area. Brain measures are highly correlated with one another and with head circumference, but none are correlated with Intelligence Quotient.
