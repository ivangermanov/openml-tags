Tags: Agriculture, Machine Learning

Context:
Heart disease is the primary cause of mortality in the developed world, resulting in an alarming number of deaths annually. It is imperative to identify individuals who are at risk of suffering from heart disease in the near future, enabling early intervention and prevention.

Content:
This project utilizes the Heart Disease dataset to develop a predictive model that identifies patients who are most susceptible to heart disease. By leveraging the provided features, we aim to create an accurate prediction system that alerts healthcare professionals about high-risk individuals, enabling timely preventive measures.
