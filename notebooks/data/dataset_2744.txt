FOREX Eur Cad Minute High 

Tags: Agriculture, Economics, Finance, Forex, Forex High, Forex Minute 

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex Eur/Cad pair obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans a period from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature follows the Europe Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high price of the next minute relative to the mean high price of the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases in the following minute, and false when the mean high price decreases or remains the same.

Please note that this task is hypothetical and intended for scientific purposes only. In real-world trading scenarios, realistic trade strategies should be based on predictions made on close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
