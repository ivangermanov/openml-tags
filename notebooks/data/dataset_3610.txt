Bike Sharing Washington DC 
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

Climate change is forcing cities to reimagine their transportation infrastructure. Shared mobility concepts, such as car sharing, bike sharing, or scooter sharing, are becoming increasingly popular. And if they are implemented well, they can actually contribute to mitigating climate change. Bike sharing, in particular, is an interesting concept because it does not require electricity or gasoline, unless electric bikes are used, for this mode of transportation. 

However, there are inherent problems associated with this type of shared mobility: varying demand at bike-sharing stations needs to be balanced to avoid oversupply or shortages; heavily used bikes break down more often. Forecasting future demand can help address these issues. Moreover, demand forecasts can help operators decide whether to expand their business, determine adequate prices, and generate additional income through advertisements at particularly busy stations.

But that's not all. Another challenge is redistributing bikes between stations and determining the optimal routes. Additionally, determining the location of new stations is also an area of interest for operators. 

This dataset can be used to forecast demand and avoid oversupply and shortages. It spans from January one to December thirty-one. Determining new station locations, analyzing movement patterns, or planning routes will only be possible with additional data.

The dataset includes the following features: 
date, 
average daily temperature in degrees Celsius, 
minimum daily temperature in degrees Celsius, 
maximum daily temperature in degrees Celsius, 
temperature at the time of observation in degrees Celsius, 
amount of precipitation in millimeters, 
wind speed in meters per second, 
weather types including fog, heavy fog, thunder, sleet, hail, glaze, haze, drift snow, high wind, mist, drizzle, rain, freeze rain, snow, ground fog, ice fog, freeze drizzle, and unknown, 
number of unregistered customers, 
number of registered customers, 
total number of customers, 
and indication of whether the day is a holiday or not.

The data used to create this dataset was taken from Capital Bikeshare for bike-sharing demand, NOAA's National Climatic Data Center for weather data, and DC Department of Human Resources for data on public holidays.

Think about the following questions and topics and add more data to this dataset to improve your results: 
What will tomorrow's, next week's, or next month's bike demand be? 
Use time-series analysis to determine this. 
Use anomaly detection to identify seasonality and trends in daily customer data. 
Which features are particularly important for forecasting bike demand?
