QSAR-TID-102414 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102414. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102414. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecules as a series of bits.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery.

The drug target TID: 102414 is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor one, which is a single protein that plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response. It is a G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in the signaling pathway of leukotrienes, which are lipid-like molecules that are involved in the inflammatory response.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery, particularly those interested in the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor one.
