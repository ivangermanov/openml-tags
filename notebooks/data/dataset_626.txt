Fri C One Five Hundred Twenty-Five is a binarized regression problem dataset in the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is part of several studies, including Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, Study Seven, and Study Eighty-Eight.

It is a binarized version of the original data set, which means it converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion is done by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('Positive') and all others as negative ('Negative').

The dataset features include various ozone-related attributes, however, these attributes are not easily interpretable by humans.
