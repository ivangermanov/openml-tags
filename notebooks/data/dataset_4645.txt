Phishing Websites Seed Zero Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Phishing Websites dataset, specifically generated with a seed value of zero. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns from the original dataset.

The dataset has undergone several transformations to reduce its size while maintaining its representativeness. First, the number of classes was reduced to ensure that the dataset is manageable for machine learning models. This was done by randomly selecting classes based on their frequency of occurrence in the original dataset. 

Next, the number of columns was also reduced to focus on the most important features. This was achieved by uniformly sampling columns from the original dataset. The resulting dataset consists of a selection of the most informative features that are relevant for distinguishing between phishing websites.

The dataset contains a range of features that are useful for identifying phishing websites. These include features related to the website's domain registration, URL structure, and web traffic patterns. Other features focus on the website's content, such as the presence of certain HTML elements or the use of specific keywords.
