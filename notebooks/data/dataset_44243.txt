**Meta Album Omni Print MD Mix Dataset**

The Omni Print MD Mix dataset consists of synthesized character images with a specific set of nuisance parameters. This dataset contains twenty-eight thousand two hundred forty images, each with a resolution of one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels, and in RGB format. The images were synthesized using the Omni Print synthesis tool, without any further processing.
