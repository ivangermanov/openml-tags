Eucalyptus Species Selection for Soil Conservation in Seasonally Dry Hill Country

This dataset aims to identify which seedlots in a species are best suited for soil conservation in dry hill country. The research focuses on finding the most suitable eucalyptus species for this purpose, taking into account various factors that affect their growth and performance.

The dataset features a range of characteristics, including the abbreviation of the species, its reproductive status, locality, map reference, latitude, altitude, rainfall, frost frequency, year of planting, species type, and various measures of tree performance such as diameter at breast height, height, survival rate, vigor, and resistance to insects.

The goal of this research is to provide insights into the selection of eucalyptus species that can effectively conserve soil in seasonally dry hill country, thereby preventing soil erosion and promoting sustainable land use practices.

Keywords: eucalyptus, soil conservation, dry hill country, species selection, tree performance, sustainable land use.
