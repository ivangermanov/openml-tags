Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean, respectively. Positive instances are denoted by 'P', while negative instances are marked as 'N'. This binarization process transforms the dataset into a format suitable for two-class classification problems.

The dataset includes several features, labeled as oz one through oz five, along with the binary classification feature. These features likely represent various measurements or attributes relevant to the classification task at hand. The binary Class feature serves as the target variable for predictive modeling or analysis.

Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation and acknowledge its derivative nature from the original source. The binarization process applied to this dataset may have implications for analysis and model performance, which should be considered when interpreting results or comparing findings to those obtained from the original, non-binarized dataset.
