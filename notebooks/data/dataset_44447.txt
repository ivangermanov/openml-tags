Cover Type Seed Four with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Using Stratification

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Cover Type dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniformly sampling columns and rows.

The dataset features include elevation, aspect, slope, horizontal distance to hydrology, vertical distance to hydrology, horizontal distance to roadways, hillshade at nine am, noon, and three pm, horizontal distance to fire points, wilderness areas, and various soil types.

Machine learning algorithms can be applied to this dataset to predict the cover type based on these features. The dataset has been stratified to ensure that each class is represented proportionally.
