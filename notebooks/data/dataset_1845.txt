QSAR-TID-12037 Dataset: Images, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12037. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systemes biivia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides information about myosin light chain kinase two, which is a single protein preferred name. It also has synonyms such as mlck two and myosin light chain kinase two, skeletal/cardiac muscle.

The organism is homo sapiens, species group is no, and protein target classification is one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/camk protein kinase group/camk protein kinase mlck family.

Description relationship accession is myosin light chain kinase two, skeletal/cardiac muscle single protein. Component includes nucleus, cytoplasm, sarcomere, and synapse.

Go function includes nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, calmodulin dependent protein kinase activity, myosin light chain kinase activity, protein binding, calmodulin binding, atp binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and myosin light chain binding.

Go process includes protein phosphorylation, striated muscle contraction, neuromuscular synaptic transmission, positive regulation of gene expression, skeletal muscle satellite cell differentiation, phosphorylation, peptidyl threonine phosphorylation, regulation of muscle filament sliding, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, protein autophosphorylation, cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis, and cardiac muscle contraction.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, MTLQSAR, myosin light chain kinase, protein kinase, phosphorylation, neuromuscular synaptic transmission, cardiac muscle contraction.
