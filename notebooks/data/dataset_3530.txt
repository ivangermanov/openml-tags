The QSAR-TID-30002 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30002. This dataset has six hundred forty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling.

The drug target TID: 30002 is also known as Calcium-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Two Gamma, or CaM Kinase Two Gamma. It belongs to the enzyme-kinase-protein kinase-CAMK protein kinase group-CAMK protein kinase CAMK two family.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including nervous system development, regulation of neuron projection development, and insulin secretion. It also plays a role in the phosphorylation of proteins and the regulation of calcium ion transport.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, CaM kinase two gamma, nervous system development, insulin secretion, protein phosphorylation, calcium ion transport.
