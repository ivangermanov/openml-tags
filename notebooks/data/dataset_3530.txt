QSAR-TID-30002 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30002. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the protein target Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type Two Gamma, also known as CaM Kinase II Gamma. This protein is a single protein and is part of the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK2 family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, nervous system development, and regulation of neuron projection development. It is also involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle adaptation, phosphorylation, and insulin secretion.

The protein has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and has been the subject of various studies on its structure and function.
