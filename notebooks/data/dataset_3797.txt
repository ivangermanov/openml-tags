This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Beta, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and many others.

This dataset contains information about the compound type, preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. 

It also includes expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process information. Additionally, there is information about canSAR-target, guide to pharmacology, int act, reactome, uniprot, interpro, and pfam.

Keywords: QSAR, Retinoid X Receptor Beta, FCFP, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, protein target classification, expression atlas, go component, go function, go process.
