QSAR-TID-11589 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11589. The dataset has eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Beta. The Retinoid X Receptor Beta is a single protein, also known as MHC Class I Regulatory Element-Binding Protein, H-2RIIBP, Nr2b2, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2 Group B Member 2, Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-Beta, and Retinoid X Receptor Beta. It is a transcription factor, nuclear receptor, and nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 2 group B member 2, and is involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, and response to retinoic acid.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it for research purposes.
