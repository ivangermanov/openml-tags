Fri C0 Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This binarized version of the original dataset converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This is achieved by computing the mean and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The resulting classes are denoted by 'Positive' and 'Negative'.
