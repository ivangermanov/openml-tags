Description 
The Scene recognition dataset is a collection of characteristics about images and their respective classes. Originally, this was a multi-label classification problem with six distinct labels: Beach, Sunset, Fall Foliage, Field, Mountain, and Urban. However, the current dataset has been transformed into a binary classification problem, focusing solely on the Urban label.
