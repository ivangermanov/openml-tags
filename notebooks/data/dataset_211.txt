This dataset, known as the Longley data, is sourced from StatLib and was originally featured in a journal article discussing the appraisal of least-squares programs from a user's perspective. The data encompasses various economic indicators and employment statistics.

The dataset includes several variables:
- Number of people employed (typically used as the dependent variable)
- GNP implicit price deflator
- Gross National Product (GNP)
- Unemployment figures
- Size of armed forces
- Non institutionalized population aged fourteen and above
- Year of observation

Employment is generally treated as the class attribute in analyses using this dataset. The other variables serve as features or predictors in statistical models.

This dataset is widely used in statistical analysis and econometric studies, particularly for examining relationships between macroeconomic factors and employment levels. It provides a comprehensive view of economic conditions and labor market dynamics over time.

Researchers and analysts often utilize the Longley dataset to test statistical methods, evaluate model performance, and explore economic trends. Its inclusion of multiple economic indicators makes it valuable for studying complex interactions within the economy and labor market.
