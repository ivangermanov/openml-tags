The Solar Flare dataset is a multivariate regression data set that consists of two versions, SF One and SF Two. SF One contains data from a specific year, whereas SF Two contains data from a different year. This dataset has three target variables that correspond to the number of times three types of solar flare, namely common, moderate, and severe, are observed within a twenty-four hour period. 

The dataset features a range of variables, including the Zurich class, the size of the largest spot, the distribution of spots, the level of activity, the evolution of the solar flare, the activity of the previous day, the complexity of the historical data, whether the solar flare became historically complex, the total area, the area of the largest spot, and the classification of the solar flare into C, M, and X classes.
