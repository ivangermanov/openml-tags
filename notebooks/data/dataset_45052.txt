This dataset, known as CMC, falls under the categories of Machine Learning and Manufacturing. It is a subset of the National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, specifically focusing on married women who were not pregnant or unsure of their pregnancy status at the time of the interview. The primary objective is to predict the current contraceptive method chosen by a woman, which can be classified into three categories - no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods - based on various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.

The characteristics considered in this prediction include a woman's age, number of children she has given birth to, level of education, her husband's level of education, religious affiliation, whether she is currently working or not, her husband's occupation, standard of living index, and exposure to media.
