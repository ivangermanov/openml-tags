This dataset is a subset of the National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not pregnant or did not know if they were at the time of interview. The problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice of a woman, which can be categorized into three groups: no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods, based on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics. 

The demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the woman include her age, the number of children she has ever given birth to, her level of education, her husband's level of education, her religion, whether she is currently working or not, her husband's occupation, and the standard of living index. Additionally, the dataset also takes into account the woman's exposure to media.
