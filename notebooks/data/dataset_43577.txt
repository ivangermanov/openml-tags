Overwatch Competitions Data - Seven Seasons

Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment, which released on May for PlayStation, Xbox One, and Windows. Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of nearly thirty characters, known as "heroes", each with a unique style of play whose roles are divided into three general categories that fit their role: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time.

I discovered this dataset on the Overwatch Subreddit and there is a similar dataset. The data was messy, so I tried to clean it and make it better and easier for visualizing and analyzing. Columns such as time, result, map, team role, character one, character two, character three, and psychological condition were transformed into an easy-to-use format.
