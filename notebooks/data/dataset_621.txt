The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting research. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is particularly useful because it allows researchers to generate datasets with varying levels of complexity and noise.

The original Friedman function has five features for input, which are related to the output through a combination of sine and squared terms. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets, which are independent from the output. However, to measure an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. Collinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values are varied to create a diverse range of scenarios. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. Similarly, the number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand. Additionally, the collinearity degrees range from zero to four, which affects the relationships between the features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining four different feature numbers, four different sample numbers, and five different collinearity degrees. Each dataset provides a unique scenario for testing machine learning algorithms.
