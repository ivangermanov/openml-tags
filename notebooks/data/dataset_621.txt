This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset features include demographic information such as age, as well as other relevant factors.
