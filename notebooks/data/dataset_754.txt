Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean, respectively. Positive instances are denoted by 'P', while negative instances are marked as 'N'. This binarization allows for a simplified two-class classification problem, which can be useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks. The dataset includes several features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers, as well as a binary class feature. Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should ensure they cite it appropriately and refer to the original version for additional context or information.
