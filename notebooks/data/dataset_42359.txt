The Conventional and Social Media Movies Dataset is a collection of data that combines conventional features, gathered from movie databases on the web, with social media features obtained from YouTube and Twitter. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of movies, including their ratings, genre, gross revenue, budget, and number of screens, as well as their performance on social media platforms.

The dataset includes a range of features, such as the movie title, year of release, ratings, genre, gross revenue, budget, number of screens, and whether it is a sequel. Additionally, it includes social media features, such as sentiment, views, likes, dislikes, comments, and aggregate followers.

The data was scraped from Twitter, YouTube, and IMDB, and it contains missing values. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and analysts interested in understanding the relationship between conventional and social media metrics and their impact on movie success.
