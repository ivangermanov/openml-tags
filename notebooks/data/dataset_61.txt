The Iris Plants Database is perhaps the most well-known database in the pattern recognition literature. This dataset is a classic in the field and is frequently referenced to this day.

The data set contains three classes of iris plants, where each class refers to a specific type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two, whereas the latter are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant.

This dataset is exceedingly simple and has been widely used in statistics and machine learning. It is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods.

Each instance in the dataset represents a plant. There are five attributes associated with each instance: sepal length in centimeters, sepal width in centimeters, petal length in centimeters, petal width in centimeters, and class.

There are no missing values in the dataset.
