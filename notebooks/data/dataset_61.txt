This dataset is widely recognized as one of the most prominent in pattern recognition literature. The paper describing it is considered a classic in the field and continues to be frequently referenced to this day. The dataset comprises three classes of iris plants, with fifty instances in each class. One class can be linearly separated from the other two, while those two cannot be linearly separated from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant, making this an exceptionally straightforward domain for analysis.

Attribute Information:
- Sepal length in centimeters
- Sepal width in centimeters
- Petal length in centimeters
- Petal width in centimeters
- Class: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica

Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, class

Dataset Information:
Each instance in this dataset represents an individual iris plant. This dataset is among the earliest used in classification method literature and is extensively utilized in both statistics and machine learning. It contains three classes of iris plants, with fifty instances per class. One class is linearly separable from the other two, while the latter two are not linearly separable from each other.

The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant, which contributes to the simplicity of this domain. It's worth noting that this dataset differs slightly from the data presented in the original article. Specifically, there are discrepancies in the thirty fifth and thirty eighth samples regarding certain feature measurements.

This dataset is complete and does not contain any missing values, which further enhances its utility for analysis and classification tasks.
