QSAR-TID-30047 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30047. The dataset has ninety-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30047. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase, also known as TNIK, which is a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes.

The TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase is a single protein that is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including the MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, and cytoskeleton organization. It is also involved in the regulation of nervous system development and response to organonitrogen compounds.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers studying the TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase and its role in various cellular processes. It can be used to develop QSAR models that predict the activity of compounds on this drug target, which can aid in the discovery of new drugs.
