QSAR-TID-12673 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12673. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Epoxide Hydratase enzyme, which is a bifunctional enzyme involved in various biological processes, including lipid metabolism and response to toxic substances. The enzyme is also known as Cytosolic Epoxide Hydrolase 2 and has multiple synonyms.

The Epoxide Hydratase enzyme is classified as a single protein and is part of the Serine Protease SC clan and Serine Protease S33 family. It has multiple functions, including magnesium ion binding, catalytic activity, and epoxide hydrolase activity.

The enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including prostaglandin production involved in inflammatory response, lipid metabolic process, and response to toxic substances. It is also involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolic process and epoxide metabolic process.

The dataset is related to various other databases, including ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, and GoProcess. It is also related to canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
