Melbourne Housing Snapshot
Tags: Context Melbourne real estate is booming.

Can you find the insight or predict the next big trend to become a real estate mogul or even harder, to snap up a reasonably priced two-bedroom unit?

This is a snapshot of a dataset created from publicly available results posted every week from Domain.com.au. The dataset has been cleaned and is now ready for data analysis magic. The dataset includes the address, type of real estate, suburb, method of selling, number of rooms, price, real estate agent, date of sale, and distance from the central business district.

Notes on Specific Variables:

The number of rooms includes the total number of rooms in the property. The price is listed in dollars. The method of selling includes the following options: property sold, property sold prior, property passed in, sold prior not disclosed, sold not disclosed, no bid, vendor bid, withdrawn prior to auction, sold after auction, and sold after auction price not disclosed. If the price or highest bid is not available, it is listed as not applicable.

The type of real estate includes bedroom, house, cottage, villa, semi, terrace, unit, duplex, townhouse, development site, and other residential. The real estate agent is the seller of the property. The date sold is the date the property was sold. The distance from the central business district is the distance from the property to the city center.

The region name is the general region of the suburb, such as west, northwest, north, northeast, and so on. The property count is the number of properties that exist in the suburb.

Additional features of the dataset include the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of car spots, land size, building size, council area, year built, latitude, longitude, and region name.
