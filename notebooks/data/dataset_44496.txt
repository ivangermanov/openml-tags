Name: Numerai Dataset Subsample

Tags: Subsampling of the Numerai dataset with stratification

This dataset is a subsample of the original Numerai dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, followed by uniformly sampling columns and rows. The goal was to create a smaller dataset that retains the essential characteristics of the original dataset.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by randomly choosing classes based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the rows that correspond to these classes.

Next, the columns of the dataset were sampled uniformly. This involved randomly selecting a subset of columns from the original dataset. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset with the reduced number of columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were sampled uniformly. This involved randomly selecting a subset of rows from the dataset, while ensuring that the class distribution was maintained. This was achieved by using stratified sampling, which ensures that the proportion of each class in the subsample is similar to that in the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a smaller number of rows, columns, and classes compared to the original dataset. However, it retains the essential characteristics of the original dataset and can be used for machine learning model development and testing.
