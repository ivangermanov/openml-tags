The Alarm Bayesian Network is a sample case study in machine learning and life science. This network repository reference is available online, showcasing its discrete medium characteristics. 

The network consists of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with five hundred nine parameters. It has an average Markov blanket size of three point five one and an average degree of two point four nine, with a maximum in-degree of four.

This network was used as a case study to demonstrate probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. The Alarm Monitoring System is a real-world example that highlights the application of machine learning in medical diagnosis.

Features of this network include various patient monitoring parameters, such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory volume, among others.
