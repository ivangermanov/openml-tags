The MiniBooNE dataset is part of the regression on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in the same way as other datasets in this category. Originally, this dataset was used in the MiniBooNE experiment to distinguish between electron neutrinos, which are considered signals, and muon neutrinos, which are considered background noise. The dataset is ordered, with all signal observations followed by background observations.

This dataset belongs to the computer systems and mathematics categories. It was previously described in a research paper titled "Boosted Decision Trees, an Alternative to Artificial Neural Networks", which presented a new approach to analyzing particle physics data using machine learning algorithms.

The dataset contains fifty particle identification features, which are numerical values representing various properties of subatomic particles. These features are used to train machine learning models to classify particles into either signal or background categories.
