QSAR-TID-138 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 138. The dataset has 1426 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The nociceptin receptor, also known as the kappa-type three opioid receptor, is a single protein target that belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway.

The receptor is expressed in the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including pain perception, behavior, and eating behavior. It is also involved in the regulation of urine volume, blood pressure, and locomotor rhythm.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of novel therapeutic compounds targeting the nociceptin receptor.
