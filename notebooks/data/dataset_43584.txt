New York Taxi Trip Enriched by Mathematica

Tags: Context

This data set was created to assist users in the New York City Taxi Trip Duration competition. New features were generated using the Wolfram Mathematica system. It is hoped that this data set will aid both young and experienced researchers in their data mastering path.

The given dataset consists of both features from the initial dataset and those generated via the Wolfram Mathematica computational system. Thus, all features can be split into the following groups: Initial features, which were extracted from the initial data; Calendar features, which contain information about the season, day name, and day period; Weather features, which provide information about temperature, snow, and rain; and Travel features, which include geo distance with estimated driving distance and time.

The dataset contains the following columns: a unique identifier for each trip; a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record; the number of passengers in the vehicle, as entered by the driver; the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second of the trip; the season, day name, and day period; the temperature, rain, and snow conditions; the start and end latitude and longitude; a flag indicating whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor; the driving distance and time, estimated via the Wolfram Mathematica system; the geo distance, which is the distance between the starting and ending points; and the trip duration in seconds, with a value of -1 indicating test rows.
