New York Taxi Trip Enriched by Mathematica

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics

This data set was created to assist users in the New York City Taxi Trip Duration competition. New features were generated using the Wolfram Mathematica system. It is hoped that this data set will aid both young and experienced researchers on their data mastery journey.

The given dataset consists of both features from the initial dataset and those generated via the Wolfram Mathematica computational system. Therefore, all features can be divided into the following groups: Initial features extracted from the initial data, Calendar features containing information about the season, day name, and day period, Weather features providing information about temperature, snow, and rain, and Travel features including geo distance with estimated driving distance and time.

The dataset contains the following columns: 

A unique identifier for each trip, 
Vendor ID indicating the provider associated with the trip record, 
Passenger count representing the number of passengers in the vehicle as entered by the driver, 
Year, 
Month, 
Day, 
Hour, 
Minute, 
Second, 
Season, 
Day Name, 
Day Period describing the day period, such as late night, morning, and so forth, 
Temperature, 
Rain, 
Snow, 
Start Latitude, 
Start Longitude, 
End Latitude, 
End Longitude, 
Flag indicating whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before being sent to the vendor due to lack of connection to the server - Store and Forward or Not a Store and Forward trip, 
Driving Distance estimated via the Wolfram Mathematica system, 
Driving Time estimated via the Wolfram Mathematica system, 
Geo Distance representing the distance between the starting and ending points, 
Trip Duration denoting the duration of the trip in seconds, where a value of minus one indicates test rows.
