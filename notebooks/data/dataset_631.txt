Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate colinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

The Friedman function is widely used for data generation and includes both linear and non-linear relations between input and output. A normalized noise is added to the output. The function incorporates trigonometric and polynomial components.

To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features independent from the output are added to the datasets. To assess algorithm robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with various colinearity degrees, representing the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in the number of features, number of samples, and colinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are randomly generated. The datasets with higher colinearity degrees have more features compared to those with lower degrees.

As a result, numerous artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.
