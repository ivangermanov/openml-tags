Abstract: This dataset was created by a medical expert to test an expert system designed for the presumptive diagnosis of two urinary system diseases. It represents a class-balanced version of the acute inflammations dataset. The data is intended to evaluate the performance of diagnostic algorithms in identifying specific urinary tract conditions based on a set of clinical features and symptoms.

The dataset comprises several features that describe various aspects of a patient's condition, including physiological measurements and reported symptoms. These features are used to determine the presence or absence of particular urinary system disorders. The class-balanced nature of the dataset ensures that it provides a fair representation of both positive and negative cases, which is crucial for developing and testing accurate diagnostic models.

This resource is valuable for researchers and practitioners in the field of medical informatics, particularly those focused on developing automated diagnostic tools for urological conditions. It offers a standardized set of data that can be used to compare the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms and expert system approaches in medical diagnosis.
