The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting research. The dataset names are coded according to their characteristics, including colinearity degree and sample number.

These datasets are widely used for testing machine learning algorithms due to their ability to simulate real-world relationships between inputs and outputs. The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, with a normalized noise added to the output.

The original Friedman function has five features as input, but additional features are added to the datasets to test the effects of nonrelated features. These added features are independent from the output. Moreover, to test an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity, which refers to the number of features dependent on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets have varying parameters, including the number of features, sample size, and colinearity degree. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output. The remaining features are randomly generated and unrelated to the output. Sample sizes range from one hundred to one thousand. Colinearity degrees vary from zero to four, indicating the extent to which features depend on each other.

In total, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample sizes, and colinearity degrees. Each dataset has a target attribute, which is the last attribute in each file.
