Name: Credit G Seed Four Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Credit G dataset with seed four

This dataset is a subsample of the original Credit G dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of columns, and then further subsampling the resulting dataset to meet the specified maximum number of rows.

The original dataset was first filtered to select a subset of classes, ensuring that the resulting dataset had a balanced representation of each class. This was achieved by selecting a specified number of classes, and then choosing the indices where one of these classes was present.

Next, the dataset was filtered to select a subset of columns, ensuring that the resulting dataset had a specified maximum number of columns. This was achieved by uniformly sampling the columns and selecting the top specified number of columns.

Finally, the dataset was subsampled to meet the specified maximum number of rows. This was achieved by stratifying the dataset according to the target variable, and then selecting a subset of rows using a train-test split.

The resulting dataset has a specified number of rows, columns, and classes, and is a representative subsample of the original Credit G dataset.
