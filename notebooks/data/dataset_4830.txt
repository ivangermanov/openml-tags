Bitcoin Heist Ransomware Dataset

Tags: Classification on both numerical and categorical features

This dataset belongs to the tabular data benchmark and is transformed in the same way.

The Bitcoin Heist Ransomware Dataset is a comprehensive collection of Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to December 2018. The dataset was created by extracting daily transactions on the network and forming a Bitcoin graph. To filter out irrelevant transactions, only network edges that transferred more than a certain threshold were considered.

Ransomware addresses were obtained from three widely adopted studies. These addresses were then used to extract six features for each address in each twenty-four hour snapshot: income, neighbors, weight, length, count, and loop. These features aim to quantify specific transaction patterns, such as the merging of coins into a single address, the number of transactions, and the distribution of coins across multiple rounds.

The dataset includes a total of twenty-four ransomware families, with some addresses appearing in more than one time window. One particular address appeared a maximum of four hundred and twenty times.

Features include:

* Address: a string representing the Bitcoin address
* Year: an integer representing the year
* Day: an integer representing the day of the year
* Length: an integer representing the number of mixing rounds on Bitcoin
* Income: an integer representing the Satoshi amount (one bitcoin is one hundred million Satoshis)
* Label: a category string representing the name of the ransomware family or "white" (not known to be ransomware)
