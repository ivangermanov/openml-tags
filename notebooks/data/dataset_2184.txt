The QSAR-TID-12742 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically designed for studying transportation-related targets. This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12742. It consists of seven hundred thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is particularly useful for researchers interested in exploring the relationship between chemical structures and their biological activities, specifically in the context of transportation-related targets.

The dataset includes information about the Alpha One D Adrenergic Receptor, a single protein target classified under the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is primarily found in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways, particularly in the regulation of blood pressure.

The Alpha One D Adrenergic Receptor is also associated with various biological processes, including negative regulation of the force of heart contraction involved in baroreceptor response to increased systemic arterial blood pressure, norepinephrine-epinephrine vasoconstriction involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.
