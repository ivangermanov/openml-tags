Name: KDD Cup 09 Uppercase Seed Four

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Uppercase with seed equals Four

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of columns using a uniform random choice. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses a stratified train test split to select a subset of the data.
