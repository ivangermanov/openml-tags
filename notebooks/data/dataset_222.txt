The SPECTF Heart dataset describes the diagnosis of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Each patient is classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. The database of SPECT image sets was processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images, resulting in forty-four continuous feature patterns created for each patient.

The CLIP three algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns, which were seventy-seven percent accurate when compared to cardiologists' diagnoses. This dataset is suitable for testing machine learning algorithms, comprising two hundred sixty-seven instances described by forty-five attributes. The predicted attribute is Overall Diagnosis, which is a binary class attribute.

There are no missing values in this dataset. The Overall Diagnosis attribute is binary, indicating whether the patient's diagnosis is normal or abnormal. The remaining attributes represent counts in different regions of interest during rest and stress tests, ranging from zero to one hundred.

This dataset is divided into training and testing data, with eighty instances in the training set and one hundred eighty-seven instances in the testing set.
