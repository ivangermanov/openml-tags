Survival treated as the class attribute. As used in research on numeric prediction using instance-based learning with encoding length selection.

Title: Echocardiogram Data

Source Information:
The data was collected by a doctor at The Reed Institute in Miami, Florida. It was received in February 1989.

Past Usage:
This dataset has been used in several studies to predict patient survival after heart attacks. Various machine learning and statistical techniques have been applied, including exemplar-based learning, wall motion scoring, and Cox regression. Accuracy rates for predicting patient mortality ranged from 60% to 87% in different studies.

Relevant Information:
All patients in this dataset suffered heart attacks at some point in the past. The data includes information on whether patients are still alive and how long they survived after their heart attack. The primary research question has been to predict whether a patient will survive for at least one year following a heart attack, based on various medical measurements. Predicting patient mortality has proven to be particularly challenging, partly due to the limited size of the dataset.

Number of Instances: 132

Number of Attributes: 13 (all numeric-valued)

Attribute Information:
The attributes include survival time, patient status (alive or deceased), age at heart attack, presence of pericardial effusion, measures of heart contractility and size, wall motion scores, and derived variables. Some attributes have missing values.

Missing Attribute Values:
Several attributes have missing values, denoted by "?". The number of missing values varies by attribute, ranging from 0 to 58.

Distribution of Attributes:
The dataset provides information on the distribution of key attributes such as patient survival status and one-year survival rates.

Features:
The features include patient status, age, pericardial effusion, measures of heart function and size, wall motion scores, and survival indicators.
