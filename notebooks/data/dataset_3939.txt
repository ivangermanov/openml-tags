QSAR-TID-101056 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101056. The data has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

The features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Scraped data includes information about serine threonine protein kinase twenty-four, also known as mammalian STE twenty-like protein kinase three. It is a single protein preferred name and has synonyms including mammalian STE twenty-like protein kinase three C-terminal, mammalian STE twenty-like protein kinase three N-terminal, MST three, and MST-three.

Organism information includes Homo sapiens species group. Protein target classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase STE protein kinase group STE protein kinase STE twenty family STE protein kinase YSK subfamily.
