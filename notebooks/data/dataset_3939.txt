QSAR-TID-101056 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101056. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101056. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 101056, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase twenty-four.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase twenty-four is a single protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, and signal transduction. It is also known to be involved in the regulation of cell migration and axon regeneration.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the serine/threonine-protein kinase twenty-four.
