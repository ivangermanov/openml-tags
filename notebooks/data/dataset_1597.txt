QSAR-TID-11058 

Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11058. The data has forty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features, namely MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
