Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Tags: Classification, Credit Card, Fraud, Unbalanced, Web Analytics

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September. The transactions occurred over a two-day period, with a small fraction being fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for a tiny percentage of all transactions.

The dataset consists of numerical input variables that are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features and detailed background information about the data cannot be provided. Most features are principal components obtained through PCA, labeled as V1, V2, and so on. The only features not transformed by PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'.

The 'Time' feature represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The 'Amount' feature indicates the transaction amount, which can be utilized for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. The 'Class' feature serves as the response variable, taking a value of 1 in cases of fraud and 0 otherwise.

This dataset was collected and analyzed during a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group of Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, focusing on big data mining and fraud detection. Additional information about current and past projects on related topics can be found on the Machine Learning Group's website.

The dataset provides an opportunity to study credit card fraud detection techniques, particularly in the context of imbalanced classification problems. It can be used to develop and evaluate machine learning models for identifying fraudulent transactions based on the provided features.
