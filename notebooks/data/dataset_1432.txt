The Colon Cancer dataset is a collection of data related to Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset was sourced from the LIBSVM data repository.

Preprocessing of this dataset involved instance-wise normalization to achieve a mean of zero and variance of one, followed by feature-wise normalization to achieve a mean of zero and variance of one.

This dataset consists of numerous features, which are not easily readable.

The Colon Cancer dataset originated from the paper titled "Broad Patterns of Gene Expression Revealed by Clustering Analysis of Tumor and Normal Colon Tissues Probed by Oligonucleotide Arrays" published in Cell Biology.
