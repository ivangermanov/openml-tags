Dataset from the LIBSVM data repository

Preprocessing: Instance-wise normalization to mean zero and variance one. Then feature-wise normalization to mean zero and variance one.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes, labeled as "att" followed by a number. There are over two thousand features in total.

This dataset focuses on gene expression patterns in colon cancer tissues. It was analyzed using clustering techniques to reveal broad patterns distinguishing tumor and normal colon tissues. The data was preprocessed through normalization methods to standardize the values across instances and features. This standardization helps in comparing gene expression levels across different samples and genes.

The dataset is part of the LIBSVM repository, which is a collection of datasets commonly used for machine learning tasks, particularly support vector machines. It provides valuable information for researchers studying colon cancer at the molecular level, potentially leading to improved diagnostic and treatment methods.
