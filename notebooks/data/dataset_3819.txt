This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11288, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11288.

The data consists of multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains features such as molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The molecule chembl id feature represents the unique identifier for each molecule in the dataset.

The median pxc fifty feature represents the median activity value for each compound.

The dataset also contains numerous fingerprint features which represent the molecular structure of each compound.

These features were generated using the pipeline pilot program and consist of binary vectors representing the presence or absence of particular molecular substructures.

The dataset is suitable for machine learning modeling and QSAR analysis.
