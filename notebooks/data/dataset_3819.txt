QSAR-TID-11288 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Coagulation Factor XII, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Coagulation Factor XII. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Coagulation Factor XII is a single protein, also known as Beta-Factor XIIa part one, Beta-Factor XIIa part two, Coagulation Factor XII, Coagulation Factor XIIa heavy chain, and Coagulation Factor XIIa light chain. It is an enzyme, a protease, a serine protease, and a serine protease PA clan, belonging to the serine protease S1A subfamily.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using the data.

The dataset contains information about the Coagulation Factor XII, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also contains information about the relationship, accession, and mechanism of action of the compounds.
