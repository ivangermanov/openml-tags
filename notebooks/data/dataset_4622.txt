Internet Advertisements Dataset 

This dataset has been subsampled from the original Internet Advertisements dataset, which had forty thousand nine hundred seventy-eight instances. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its representative nature.

The subsampling process began by selecting classes uniformly. Since there were more than ten classes in the original dataset, the most frequent classes were chosen based on their probability distribution. The instances corresponding to these selected classes were then extracted.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled. As there were more than one hundred columns in the original dataset, a subset of columns was randomly chosen. The instances were then filtered to include only the selected columns.

Finally, the instances were subsampled again to ensure that the total number of rows did not exceed two thousand. This step involved stratifying the data according to the class labels to maintain the representative nature of the dataset.
