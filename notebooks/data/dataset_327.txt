The bridges dataset, tagged as UCI, is derived from the Pittsburgh bridges data. This version removes instances with missing values in the target attribute to avoid confusion in benchmarking results. The dataset was originally not intended for classification but has been widely used as such in literature, with the last attribute serving as the target.

The dataset contains information about various bridges, including their location, construction date, purpose, dimensions, and structural characteristics. It comprises both continuous/integer and nominal attributes, with some attributes having mixed types.

Attribute information includes:
- Identifier for each example
- River (A, M, O)
- Location (numbered from 1 to 52)
- Year erected (ranging from 1818 to 1986, also categorized as CRAFTS, EMERGING, MATURE, MODERN)
- Purpose (WALK, AQUEDUCT, RR, HIGHWAY)
- Length (ranging from 804 to 4558, also categorized as SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG)
- Number of lanes (1, 2, 4, 6)
- Clear G (N, G)
- Type of deck (THROUGH, DECK)
- Material (WOOD, IRON, STEEL)
- Span (SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG)
- Relative length (S, S-F, F)
- Type of bridge (WOOD, SUSPENSION, SIMPLE T, ARCH, CANTILEVER, CONTINUOUS T)

There are two versions of the database: V1 contains the original examples, while V2 contains descriptions after discretizing numeric properties. The domain is considered a DESIGN domain, where five properties (design description) need to be predicted based on seven specification properties.

The dataset contains missing values, which may impact analysis and modeling efforts. Researchers using this dataset should be aware of these missing values and handle them appropriately in their studies.
