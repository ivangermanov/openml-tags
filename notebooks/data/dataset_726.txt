The Fri C Two Dataset has been binarized into a new version, which converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset belongs to the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and is a useful resource for researchers and students alike.

Features of this dataset include Oz One, Oz Two, Oz Three, Oz Four, Oz Five, and Binary Class.
