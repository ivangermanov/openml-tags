This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This process allows for a more straightforward analysis of the data.

The dataset consists of various features, including observations and experimental results, which are crucial in understanding the underlying chemistry and life science principles. By binarizing the data, researchers can focus on identifying patterns and correlations between these features and the resulting Positive or Negative classifications.
