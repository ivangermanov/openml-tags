QSAR-TID-10544 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10544. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 203 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is Purinergic receptor P2Y1, also known as ADP receptor, P2RY1, P2Y1, and P2Y purinoceptor 1. It is a single protein and a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in the signaling pathway of nucleotide-like receptors.

The protein is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as a small molecule receptor. It has various synonyms, including ADP receptor, P2RY1, P2Y1, and P2Y purinoceptor 1.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, G protein-coupled adenosine receptor signaling pathway, monoatomic ion transport, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway.

The protein is also involved in various cellular components, including plasma membrane, cilium, cell surface, postsynaptic density, and membrane.
