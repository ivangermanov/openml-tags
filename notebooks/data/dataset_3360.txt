This is an Experimental Dataset for Classifying Numbers in a Lottery as Highly Likely to be Picked or Not Very Likely to be Picked. It is Based on a Little More Than a Year's Worth of Actual Daily Drawing Results from the Florida Fantasy Five, with Derivative Elements Such as Count of Times Picked, Average Times Picked, Days Since Last Picked, and so on.

The Dataset Includes Various Features That Can Help in Predicting the Likelihood of a Number Being Picked, Including the Total Count of Times a Number Has Been Picked, the Average Days Since a Number Was Last Picked, the Mean and Median Counts of Numbers Picked, the Variance and Standard Deviation of Counts, and Many More.

These Features Are Designed to Capture Different Aspects of a Number's History in the Lottery, Such as Its Popularity, Consistency, and Volatility. By Analyzing These Features, a Machine Learning Model Can Learn Patterns and Relationships That Can Help Identify Numbers That Are Highly Likely to be Picked in Future Drawings.
