This is the dataset used for the IDA Industrial Challenge, courtesy of Scania. For a full description, see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/IDA2016Challenge. This dataset contains both the train and test sets provided. The first sixty thousand samples are the train set, and the last sixteen thousand samples are the test set.

Data was published under the GNU General Public License version three license. 

Features: 
class
and one hundred seventy-one anonymized operational data features, including seven histogram variables. 

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure System, which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The dataset's positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the Air Pressure System. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the Air Pressure System. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.

The challenge metric is the cost-metric of misclassification: Predicted class versus true class, with a cost of ten for type one failure and five hundred for type two failure. The total cost of a prediction model is the sum of these costs multiplied by the number of instances, resulting in a total cost.

The training set contains sixty thousand examples in total, with fifty-nine thousand belonging to the negative class and one thousand belonging to the positive class. The test set contains sixteen thousand examples.

The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for proprietary reasons. They consist of both single numerical counters and histograms consisting of bins with different conditions. Typically, the histograms have open-ended conditions at each end. For example, if we were measuring the ambient temperature, then the histogram could be defined with four bins where: bin one collects values for temperatures less than minus twenty degrees, bin two collects values for temperatures greater than or equal to minus twenty degrees and less than zero degrees, bin three collects values for temperatures greater than or equal to zero degrees and less than twenty degrees, and bin four collects values for temperatures greater than twenty degrees.

Missing values are denoted by 'not available'.
