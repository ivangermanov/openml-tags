The dataset, named All of Trumps Tweets, is categorized under Computer Systems and Machine Learning. This comprehensive collection of tweets includes essential information such as the actual text, whether the tweet is a retweet, whether it has been deleted, and many other relevant details. The tweets are organized in reverse chronological order, meaning the most recent tweets appear first, followed by the older ones.

Acknowledgments are due to the Trump Twitter Archive, which served as the primary source for gathering this data. For those interested, the archive can be accessed via the following link: https://www.thetrumparchive.com/faq.

One potential application of this dataset could be sentiment analysis, which involves examining the emotional tone behind each tweet.

The features included in this dataset are the unique identifier for each tweet, the actual text itself, whether it is a retweet or not, whether it has been deleted, the type of device used to send the tweet, the number of times it was favorited, the number of retweets, the date it was posted, and whether it has been flagged or not.
