The dataset, All of Trump's Tweets, contains a comprehensive collection of content, including the text of each tweet, whether it is a retweet, whether it has been deleted, and much more. The data is sorted in descending order by date, with the earliest tweets from the beginning of the dataset and the most recent tweets at the end.

Acknowledgments are due to the Trump Twitter Archive, which provided the data used in this dataset.

This dataset could be used for sentiment analysis, among other applications.

The features of this dataset include the unique identifier for each tweet, the text of the tweet itself, whether the tweet is a retweet, whether the tweet has been deleted, the device used to post the tweet, the number of favorites and retweets, the date the tweet was posted, and whether the tweet has been flagged.
