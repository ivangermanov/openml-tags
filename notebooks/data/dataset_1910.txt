This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10441. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Fingerprint Circular Fragment 1024-bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about Neprilysin, also known as Atriopeptidase, CD ten, Enkephalinase, MME, and NEP. It is an enzyme, specifically a metallo protease, belonging to the Metallo protease MAE clan and Metallo protease M thirteen family.

Neprilysin is involved in various biological processes, including kidney development, proteolysis, peptide metabolic process, substance P catabolic process, bradykinin catabolic process, sensory perception of pain, hormone catabolic process, creatinine metabolic process, amyloid-beta metabolic process, cellular response to cytokine stimulus, cellular response to ultraviolet A and B, and replicative senescence.

It is also associated with various components, including cytoplasm, plasma membrane, brush border, synaptic vesicle, membrane, axon, dendrite, neuron projection terminus, and synapse.

Keywords: QSAR, Neprilysin, Metallo protease, Biological processes, Cellular responses, Enzyme, Proteolysis, Peptide metabolism.
