The Debutanizer Column is part of a Desulfurizing and Naphtha Splitter Plant.

Top Temperature, Top Pressure, Reflux Flow, Flow to Next Process, Sixth Tray Temperature, Bottom Temperature, and Bottom Temperature are all important variables in this process.

Butane Content in the Debutanizer Bottoms, which serves as the Naphtha Splitter Feed, is a key output variable.

For more information on this topic, please refer to Appendix A.3 of the Fortuna dataset.
