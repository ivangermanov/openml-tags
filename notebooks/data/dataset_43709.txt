The goal of this dataset, US Presidential Election Speeches, is to provide a tidy way to access the transcripts of speeches given by various United States politicians in the context of the presidential election. The transcripts have been scraped from Rev.com, and some other information, such as the location and type of speech, have been manually added to the dataset.

The dataset has the following columns: the speaker, who gave the speech; the title, a title or a description of the speech; the text, the transcript of the speech; the location, the location or the platform where the speech was given; and the type, the type of speech, such as a campaign speech, interview, or debate.

We would not be here without the help of others. If we owe any attributions or thanks, we include them here along with any citations of past research.

Our inspiration is to see our data in front of the world's largest data science community. We want to see questions answered, such as the impact of speeches on the election outcome, the tone and language used by different politicians, and the differences in speeches given at different locations.
