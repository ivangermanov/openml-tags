Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: utterance, frame, coefficient through coefficient, binary class

This dataset, known as Japanese Vowels, is a modified version of an original dataset with unknown origins. The primary alteration involves the conversion of a multi-class target feature into a binary classification problem. In this new format, the majority class is labeled as positive ('P'), while all other classes are grouped together and labeled as negative ('N'). This binarization process simplifies the classification task while retaining the essence of the original data structure.

The dataset includes various features related to speech analysis, such as utterance characteristics, frame information, and multiple coefficients that likely represent acoustic properties of the vowel sounds. The final feature, binary class, serves as the target variable for classification tasks.

Researchers and data scientists interested in speech recognition, linguistic analysis, or binary classification problems may find this dataset particularly useful for their studies and experiments.
