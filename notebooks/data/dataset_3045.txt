QSAR-TID-17106 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17106. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Folded Chemical Fragmentation Patterns six hundred twenty-four-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides information about the Serotonin One-D Receptor, also known as Five-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor One-D, Five-HT-One-D, or HTR-One-D. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.

The receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, and synapse. Its functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, G protein-coupled serotonin receptor activity, and neurotransmitter receptor activity.

It participates in various biological processes, such as smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission. Additionally, it regulates locomotion, vasoconstriction, and behavior.
