QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Serotonin d (HT d) receptor, also known as HT D, hydroxytryptamine receptor D, HTR D, and Serotonin receptor D. This receptor is found in Sus scrofa (pig) and is classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein coupled receptor category, specifically a small molecule receptor and monoamine receptor within the serotonin receptor family.

The receptor is associated with several cellular components including the plasma membrane, general membrane structures, dendrites, and synapses. Its functions include G protein coupled receptor activity, G protein coupled serotonin receptor activity, and neurotransmitter receptor activity. The receptor is involved in numerous biological processes such as smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of locomotion, vasoconstriction, and regulation of behavior.

Cross references for this target include UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam entries. The InterPro entries highlight the receptor's classification as a G protein coupled rhodopsin like receptor and its specific serotonin receptor characteristics. The Pfam entry further confirms its classification within the seven transmembrane receptor (rhodopsin family) group.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains valuable information for researchers studying drug interactions with the Serotonin d receptor. The molecular fingerprints provided offer detailed structural information about the compounds tested, enabling in depth analysis of structure activity relationships.
