UCI Student Performance Por

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, which were collected using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language.

The dataset was modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. An important note is that the target attribute Final Grade has a strong correlation with First Period Grade and Second Period Grade. This occurs because Final Grade is the final year grade issued at the third period, while First Period Grade and Second Period Grade correspond to the first and second period grades. It is more difficult to predict Final Grade without First Period Grade and Second Period Grade, but such prediction is much more useful.

This dataset regards the performance in Portuguese.
