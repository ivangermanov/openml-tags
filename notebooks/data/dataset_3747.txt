QSAR-TID-12226 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12226. The dataset has a total of six hundred and sixty-five rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September two thousand and fifteen. The dataset should be cited as it is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of QSAR modeling.

The features of the dataset include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. The molecular fingerprints are represented as FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling.
