The QSAR-TID-12226 dataset, tagged as MTLQSAR and study three, related to Transportation, is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12226. It consists of six hundred sixty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and class features.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset includes molecule identifiers and median pseudo-pCI50 values.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, Extended Connectivity Fingerprints.
