Context: 
This case revolves around Thera Bank, whose management is keen on exploring ways to convert its liability customers into personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors. A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate, which has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

The file Bank.xls contains data on customers. The data includes customer demographic information, such as age and income, as well as the customer's relationship with the bank, such as mortgage and securities account, and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign. Among these customers, only a small percentage accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign. There are no empty or missing values in the dataset. The dataset has a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, but all categorical data are represented with numbers. Moreover, some of the predictor variables are heavily skewed, making the data preprocessing an interesting yet not too challenging aspect of the data.
