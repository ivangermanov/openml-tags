This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. The goal is to predict the number of shares in social networks, or popularity. The articles were published by Mashable and their content, as the rights to reproduce it, belongs to them. Hence, this dataset does not share the original content but some statistics associated with it. The original content can be publicly accessed and retrieved using the provided URLs.
