QSAR-TID-101221 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101221. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset, which was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen. The dataset does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are machine-readable and not human-readable.

The dataset is related to the Single Protein known as Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase DCLK two, which is also known by multiple synonyms including CaMK-Like CREB Regulatory Kinase two, CL two, CLICK two, CLICK-two, DCAMKL two, and multiple others.

The organism associated with this dataset is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group of no protein target classification. The protein target classification for this dataset is one enzyme kinase protein kinase CAMK protein kinase group CAMK protein kinase DCAMK one family.

Keywords: QSAR, TID, MetaQSAR, ChEMBL, FCFP, Molecular Fingerprints, SMILES, Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase DCLK two, Homo sapiens.
