This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-12789, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12789, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12789.

The target protein is an endothelin receptor, also known as Endothelin Receptor ETA, EDNRA, Endothelin-One Receptor, Endothelin Receptor Type A, ET-A, ET-AR. It belongs to the species Sus scrofa and is classified as a single protein, specifically a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, blood circulation, regulation of blood pressure, intracellular signal transduction, vasoconstriction, developmental pigmentation, enteric nervous system development, and endothelin receptor signaling pathway. 

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, endothelin receptor, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.
