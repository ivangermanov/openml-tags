QSAR-TID-12789 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12789. The dataset has a total of three hundred and nine rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred and twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12789. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is particularly useful for researchers interested in studying the activity of compounds on the endothelin receptor ET-A, which is a single protein target. The endothelin receptor ET-A is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, blood circulation, and regulation of blood pressure.
