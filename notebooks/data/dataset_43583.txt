Water Capture by Method

Tags: Context

Although it does not rain frequently in Los Angeles, the city has implemented various methods to capture rainfall, thereby increasing our local water supply. This dataset displays the cumulative amount of water captured this season, as well as the amount captured today.

Each row in this dataset corresponds to a specific date and time at which a measurement was taken. The measurements include water captured in rain barrels and cisterns, incidental capture, green infrastructure capture, and other methods.

This dataset was created using Kaggle's API from the City of Los Angeles' open data portal. The data was retrieved using the following command: curl -o los angeles water capture.csv https://data.lacity.org/resource/bnhe-q7a5.csv. The dataset was then initialized and created using Kaggle's datasets API.

The inspiration behind this dataset is to explore the frequency of rainfall in Los Angeles and to identify the primary sources of rain capture.
