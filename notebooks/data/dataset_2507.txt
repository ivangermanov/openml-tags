The UMIST Faces Cropped dataset is a collection of images related to Chemistry, Earth Science, and Vision. This dataset consists of five hundred seventy-five grayscale face images of twenty different individuals, showcasing a range of poses from profile to frontal views. Each individual is represented in a separate directory labeled one-a, one-b, and so on up to one-t, with images numbered consecutively as they were taken.

The images are eight-bit grayscale, ranging in value from zero to two hundred fifty-five. A few images have varying views of the twenty individuals. The dataset has been manually cropped by Daniel Graham at UMIST. 

Characteristics of this dataset include pixel values that describe the facial features of the individuals.
