Higgs Seed Four N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Cols One Hundred Stratify True

This dataset is a subsampling of the Higgs dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of four, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, a maximum number of classes of ten, and stratification enabled.

The dataset was created by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of columns, and then further sampling the resulting data to meet the specified row limit. The sampling process was stratified according to the class distribution to ensure that the resulting dataset retains a similar class balance to the original.

The dataset features include various physical properties, such as particle energies, momenta, and angles, which are used to characterize high-energy collisions in a particle detector.
