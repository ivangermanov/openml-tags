QSAR-TID-20084 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20084. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The target protein is Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 Beta, also known as Factor A, which is a single protein. It is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is involved in various cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism, cell growth, and development.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, centrosome, cytosol, microtubule, plasma membrane, postsynaptic density, and other cellular components. It is involved in various biological processes, including glycogen metabolic process, gene expression, cell growth, and development.

The protein has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been shown to interact with various proteins, including beta-catenin, tau protein, and p53.
