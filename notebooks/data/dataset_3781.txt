Throughout the entire history of Russian elections, there have been some intriguing anomalies in the voting results. This dataset provides an opportunity to uncover these irregularities.

Each row of the dataset represents detailed voting results from a local election commission, which is the lowest level of the Russian election system. These local election sites serve as a means for a small group of people living nearby to cast their votes. Typically, the number of linked voters ranges from one thousand to two thousand for each election site. However, for foreign-based election sites located at Russian embassies around the world, the number of linked voters can reach up to seven thousand.

The dataset is available on GitHub, and the raw data was obtained from a renowned Russian election statistics researcher.

The dataset includes various features, such as region name, tik name, and uik name, which provide information about the electoral district. Additionally, the dataset contains details on the number of registered voters, received ballots, and different types of ballots, including early voting ballots, on-site ballots, and off-site ballots. It also includes data on unused ballots, found off-site ballots, found on-site ballots, invalid ballots, valid ballots, lost ballots, and unaccounted ballots. Furthermore, the dataset provides information on the distribution of votes among the candidates.
