Insurance Bayesian Network Sample Two

This Bayesian network repository reference is categorized under bnlearn, insurance, life science, machine learning, and sample. The Insurance Bayesian Network Sample Two has twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with one thousand and eight parameters.

The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point nineteen, while the average degree is roughly three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree is three. 

This Bayesian network was designed to model various factors influencing insurance costs. It takes into account the driver's history, driving skills, age, vehicle characteristics, safety features, and socioeconomic status, among other factors. 

The network includes variables related to the driver's profile, such as their accident history, driving quality, risk aversion, and whether they are a good student. Additionally, it considers the characteristics of the vehicle, including its make and model, mileage, and year, as well as safety features like anti-theft devices, airbags, and anti-lock brakes.

Other variables in the network include the cost of repairs, medical expenses, and the value of the car, as well as the driver's home base and senior training status.
