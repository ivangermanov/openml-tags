Name: Ada Seed One Subsample Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Ada dataset with seed one, generated with the following source code:

This dataset is a subsample of the original Ada dataset, with a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsampling process was stratified to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the classes were uniformly sampled to select the desired number of classes. Then, the indices where one of these classes is present were selected. The dataset was then reduced to these indices.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to select the desired number of columns. The dataset was then reduced to these columns.

Finally, the dataset was stratified to ensure that the class distribution is preserved, and the desired number of rows was selected.
