This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101397, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101397. It has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, dated September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited when used.

The dataset shows activity values, measured in pseudo-pCI fifty, of several compounds on drug target Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor four. This receptor is also known as G-Protein Coupled Receptor twenty-three, LPA four, and LPAR four. It is a single protein preferred name, belonging to the species group Homo sapiens.

The protein target classification is one point Membrane Receptor, Family A G-Protein Coupled Receptor, Small Molecule Receptor, Lipid-Like Ligand Receptor, and EDG Receptor.

Keywords: QSAR, Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor, G-Protein Coupled Receptor, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings.
