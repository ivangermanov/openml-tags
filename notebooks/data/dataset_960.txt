Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion was originally performed to create a binary classification dataset from the multi-class original.

Features: Left Core Temperature, Left Surface Temperature, Left Oxygen Saturation, Left Blood Pressure, Surface Stability, Core Stability, Blood Pressure Stability, Comfort Level, Binary Classification

This dataset contains postoperative patient information that has been processed for binary classification purposes. The original multi-class data was transformed to create a simpler two-class problem, which is often useful for certain types of machine learning and statistical analyses. The features included in this dataset cover various physiological measurements and stability indicators, providing a comprehensive view of a patient's postoperative condition.
