This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this revised version, the multi-class target feature has been transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This transformation was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

The resulting dataset contains several features, including Core Levels, Surface Oxygen Levels, Blood Pressure, Comfort Levels, and a Binary Class designation.
