The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function includes five features for input and is as follows: 
output equals ten times sine of pi times input one times input two plus twenty times input three minus point five squared plus ten times input four plus five times input five plus noise. 

To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 
These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. 
The collinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: 
the number of features ranges from five to one hundred; 
the number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand; 
collinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with collinearity degree four, the numbers of features are generated accordingly. 
The other datasets have varying numbers of features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees. 
The last attribute in each file is the target.
