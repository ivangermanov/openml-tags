Subsampling of the dataset Helena with Seed Equal to Two 
Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Helena dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of two, a maximum number of rows equal to two thousand, a maximum number of columns equal to one hundred, a maximum number of classes equal to ten, and stratification enabled.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the original dataset were identified, and if there were more than ten classes, a random selection of ten classes was made based on their value counts. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the dataset.

Next, the column selection process was performed. If the original dataset had more than one hundred columns, a random selection of one hundred columns was made, and the dataset was filtered accordingly. Otherwise, all columns were retained.

Finally, if the resulting dataset still had more than two thousand rows, a stratified sampling approach was employed to reduce the number of rows to two thousand while maintaining the class distribution.

The resulting dataset has the following characteristics: 
Features: Twenty-seven variables, including V One, V Two, V Three,..., V Twenty-Seven, and Class.
Class Labels: Ten distinct classes.
