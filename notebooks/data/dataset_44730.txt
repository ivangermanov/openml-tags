Subsampling of the dataset Helena with a random seed. This dataset was generated by subsampling the original Helena dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, and then selecting the indices where one of these classes is present. The resulting dataset has a limited number of classes. 

The dataset was further subsampled by uniformly selecting columns from the original dataset, if required. The number of columns was limited to a maximum number. The dataset was then further subsampled by limiting the number of rows, while maintaining the stratification of the classes. 

The resulting dataset has a limited number of rows, columns, and classes. The categorical columns were converted to string format for OpenML. The dataset contains a subset of the original features, which are not human-readable.
