The Andromeda dataset concerns the prediction of future values for six water quality variables, namely temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, oxygen, and turbidity, in Thermaikos Gulf of Thessaloniki, Greece. Measurements of the target variables are taken from underwater sensors with a sampling interval and then averaged to get a single measurement for each variable over each day. The specific dataset used here corresponds to using a window of days and a lead of days, meaning we predict the values of each variable ahead. 

The dataset features include attributes corresponding to the values of the six water quality variables up to days in the past. 

The target variables include temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, oxygen, and turbidity.
