Every year, Good Reads announces a contest for the Best Book of the Year, known as the Good Reads Choice Awards. This esteemed award has multiple categories, and every reader has the opportunity to vote for a single book in each category.

The data used in this dataset is carefully scraped from the Good Reads Choice Awards website using the powerful programming language, Python. 

This comprehensive dataset includes information about each book, including its title, the category it belongs to, the year it was published, the average rating given by readers, the number of pages, the publishing company responsible for releasing the book, and the distribution of ratings given by readers, ranging from one star to five stars.
