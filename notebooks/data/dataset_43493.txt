The GoodReads Choice Awards is an annual contest that recognizes the best books of the year. Every year, GoodReads announces the contest, which features multiple categories, and every reader can vote for a single book in each category.

The data for the GoodReads Choice Awards is scraped from the awards website using Python. The dataset contains information about each book, including its title, category, year of publication, average rating, number of pages, publication date, and publisher.

The dataset also includes information about the ratings given by readers, including the number of five-star, four-star, three-star, two-star, and one-star ratings.
