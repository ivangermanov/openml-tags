This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes various features related to automobiles, including the vehicle's Symboling, Wheel Base, Length, Width, Height, Curb Weight, Engine Size, Bore, Stroke, Compression Ratio, Horsepower, Peak RPM, City MPG, Highway MPG, and Binary Class.
