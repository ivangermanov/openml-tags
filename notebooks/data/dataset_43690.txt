Context: Electronic Dance Music (EDM) is a genre where thousands of new songs are released every week. The list of EDM subgenres considered is long, but it also evolves according to trends and musical tastes. With this in view, we have retrieved two sets of over two thousand songs separated by more than a year. Songs belong to the top one hundred list of an EDM website taxonomy of more than twenty subgenres that changed in the period considered.

Content: Each row is an electronic music song. The dataset contains one hundred songs for each genre among Beatport electronic music genres, they were the top one hundred songs of their genres on November 2018. Columns are audio features extracted from a two-minute random sample of the file audio. These features have been extracted using pyAudioAnalysis.

Inspiration: These datasets are used in the publication "Automatic Subgenre Classification in an Electronic Dance Music Taxonomy" where we test the effectiveness of automatic classification on these sets and delve into the results.
