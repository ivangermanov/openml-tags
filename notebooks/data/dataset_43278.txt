Graph Inference Dataset

Tags: 

The Graph Inference Dataset contains graph datasets in CSV format, used in the article "Learning Functional Causal Models with Generative Neural Networks". The dataset consists of two main categories: graphs without hidden variables and graphs with hidden variables.

The first category includes files with names ending in "_numdata.csv", which contain data of around twenty variables connected in a graph. These graphs have a maximum of two, three, four, or five parents for each node, referred to as G2, G3, G4, and G5 respectively. Each corresponding file ending in "_target.csv" contains the ground truth of the graph, showing the causal relationships between variables.

The second category includes files with names starting with "Big", which are larger graphs with one hundred variables. 

The second category also includes files with names ending in "_confounders_numdata.csv", which contain data of around twenty variables connected in a graph with three hidden variables. Each corresponding file ending in "_confounders_skeleton.csv" contains the skeleton of the graph, including spurious links due to common hidden causes. Each file ending in "_confounders_target.csv" contains the ground truth of the graph, showing the direct visible causal relationships between variables. The task is to recover the direct visible links between cause and effect while removing the spurious links from the skeleton.

Keywords: graph inference, causal models, generative neural networks, hidden variables, causal relationships, spurious links.
