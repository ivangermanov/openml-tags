The Graph Inference Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset consists of graph datasets in CSV format used in the article "Learning Functional Causal Models with Generative Neural Networks". 

There are two types of files. Files named "*_numdata.csv" contain data of around twenty variables connected in a graph without hidden variables. These files are categorized into four groups: G2, G3, G4, and G5, which refer to graphs with a maximum of two, three, four, and five parents per node, respectively. Each corresponding "*_target.csv" file contains the ground truth of the graph, indicating cause-and-effect relationships.

Files starting with "Big" contain larger graphs with one hundred variables.

The second set of files includes "*_confounders_numdata.csv", which contain data of around twenty variables connected in a graph with three hidden variables. Each corresponding "*_confounders_skeleton.csv" file contains the skeleton of the graph, including spurious links due to common hidden causes. Meanwhile, each "*_confounders_target.csv" file contains the ground truth of the graph, indicating direct visible cause-and-effect relationships while omitting spurious links. The task is to recover the direct visible links between causes and effects while eliminating spurious links from the skeleton.
