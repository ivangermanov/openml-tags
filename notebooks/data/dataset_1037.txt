ADA is the marketing database. The task of ADA is to discover high revenue people from census data. This is a two class classification problem. The raw data from the census bureau is known as the Adult database in the UCI machine learning repository. The original attributes (features) include age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, native country, and others. It contains continuous, binary and categorical features. This dataset is from the "prior knowledge track", meaning it has access to the original features and their identity.

This dataset contains samples from both training and validation datasets. The training set includes positive and negative examples, as does the validation set.

- Age: Instance's age (numeric)
- Work class: Instance's work class (nominal)
