The dataset represents individual patients who underwent major lung resections for primary lung cancer at the Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre between 2007 and 2011. This dataset is associated with the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Wroclaw and Lower-Silesian Centre for Pulmonary Diseases in Poland, and is part of the National Lung Cancer Registry administered by the Institute of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases in Warsaw, Poland.

Features include diagnosis-specific combinations of ICD-10 codes for primary and secondary tumors, forced vital capacity, volume that has been exhaled at the end of the first second of forced expiration, performance status on the Zubrod scale, pain, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, cough, weakness, T in clinical TNM classification, type two diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction up to six months prior, peripheral arterial disease, smoking history, asthma, age at surgery, and one-year survival period.

There are no missing values in this dataset. 

Diagnosis-specific combinations of ICD-10 codes for primary and secondary tumors include six different types. Forced vital capacity ranges from 1.4 to 6.3, with an average of 3.3 and a standard deviation of 0.9. Volume that has been exhaled at the end of the first second of forced expiration ranges from 0.96 to 86.3, with an average of 4.6 and a standard deviation of 11.8. Performance status on the Zubrod scale includes three categories. Pain, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, cough, weakness, type two diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction up to six months prior, peripheral arterial disease, smoking history, and asthma are all binary variables. Age at surgery ranges from twenty-one to eighty-seven, with an average of fifty-two point five and a standard deviation of eight point seven.

One-year survival period is also a binary variable, with seventy instances having true values and four hundred instances having false values.
