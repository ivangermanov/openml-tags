Models of human cognition hold that information processing occurs in a series of stages. Cognitive psychology, in particular, is concerned with the internal mental processes that begin with the appearance of an external stimulus and result in a behavioral response.

Explore human cognitive processes around the generation of narratives with a focus on the language employed in stories about events that have been experienced versus imagined. Investigate and characterize cognitive processes involved in storytelling, contrasting imagination and recollection of events with the help of data science.

Build a machine learning model that would help categorize cognitive processes involved in storytelling - imagined, recalled, or retold.

The dataset includes the following features:

Assignment ID, unique identifier of each story
Work Time in Seconds, time taken to complete the task
Worker ID, unique identifier of each worker
Annotator Age, lower limit of the age range of the worker
Annotator Gender, gender of the worker
Annotator Race, race or ethnicity of the worker
Distracted, level of distraction while writing the story
Draining, emotional taxation of writing the story
Frequency, how often the event is thought about or discussed
Importance, impact or personal significance of the story
Log Time Since Event, logarithmic time since the event occurred
Main Event, brief description of the primary event
Memory Type, type of story, whether recalled, imagined, or retold
Most Surprising, most unexpected aspect of the story
Openness, continuous measure of openness to experience
Recalled-Aggregate Pair ID, identifier linking recalled and retold stories
Recalled-Imagined Pair ID, identifier linking recalled and imagined stories
Similarity, how closely the event relates to the writer's life
Similarity Reason, explanation for the perceived similarity
Story, narrative about the imagined or recalled event
Stressful, level of stress associated with writing the task
Summary, concise overview of the events in the story
Time Since Event, time elapsed since the event occurred
