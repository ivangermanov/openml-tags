Context Models of Human Cognition hold that information processing occurs in a series of stages. Cognitive psychology, in particular, is concerned with the internal mental processes that begin with the appearance of an external stimulus and result in a behavioral response.

Explore human cognitive processes around the generation of narratives with a focus on the language employed in stories about events that have been experienced versus imagined. Investigate and characterize cognitive processes involved in storytelling, contrasting imagination and recollection of events with the help of Data Science. Build a machine learning model that would help categorize cognitive processes involved in storytelling - Imagined, Recalled, or Retold.

The dataset used for this study includes features such as Assignment ID, Work Time in Seconds, Worker ID, Annotator Age, Annotator Gender, Annotator Race, level of distraction while writing, emotional draining, frequency of thinking or talking about the event, importance of the story, log of time since the event, main event description, memory type, most surprising aspect, openness to experience, ID of the recalled story corresponding to the retold story, ID of the recalled story corresponding to the imagined story, similarity to real life, reason for similarity, story about the imagined or recalled event, stress level while writing, and summary of the events.

The goal is to understand human cognitive processes using machine learning, exploring how people generate narratives about experienced and imagined events.
