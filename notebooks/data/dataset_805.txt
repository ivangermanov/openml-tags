Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled oz one through oz fifty, along with a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem used for various studies and mythbusting purposes. The original numeric target variable was converted into a binary classification by calculating the mean value and assigning instances below that threshold as positive and those above as negative. This transformation allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression task. The dataset consists of fifty input features, labeled sequentially, and a binary target variable. Researchers and data scientists can utilize this dataset to explore classification techniques, compare algorithm performance, and investigate potential myths or misconceptions in data analysis and machine learning.
