The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits 

This dataset is tagged with AzurePilot, OpenML-CC18, OpenML100, study_1, study_123, study_41, and study_99, and belongs to the vision category.

The MNIST database of handwritten digits consists of seven hundred eighty-four features and provides raw data available at the MNIST website. This dataset can be divided into a training set consisting of the first sixty thousand examples, and a test set consisting of ten thousand examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The dataset is ideal for researchers who wish to apply learning techniques and pattern recognition methods to real-world data without investing excessive time in preprocessing and formatting. The original black and white images from NIST were size-normalized to fit within a twenty-by-twenty pixel box, preserving their aspect ratio. As a result of the anti-aliasing technique employed during normalization, the images now contain gray levels. The images were subsequently centered in a twenty-eight-by-twenty-eight image by calculating the center of mass of the pixels and translating the image to position this point at the center of the twenty-eight-by-twenty-eight field.

Some classification methods, particularly template-based methods like Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors, exhibit improved error rates when the digits are centered using bounding boxes instead of the center of mass approach. Researchers should report any such preprocessing steps in their publications.

The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's Special Database Three (SD-3) and Special Database One (SD-1). SD-3 was initially designated as the training set, whereas SD-1 served as the test set. However, SD-3 proved to be much cleaner and easier to recognize compared to SD-1 due to its collection among Census Bureau employees, whereas SD-1 was collected among high school students. To ensure drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments, it became essential to create a new database by combining NIST's datasets.

The MNIST training set consists of thirty thousand patterns from SD-3 and thirty thousand patterns from SD-1. The test set comprises five thousand patterns from SD-3 and five thousand patterns from SD-1. The sixty-thousand-pattern training set includes examples from approximately two hundred fifty writers, ensuring that the sets of writers for both the training and test sets remained disjoint.
