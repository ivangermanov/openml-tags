Please cite: This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies: The datasets are derived from various published studies on topics including carbolenes, melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, QSAR analysis, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity relationships, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated compounds, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro and bromoalkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, protein engineering, stability of aromatic amides, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

These studies employed various computational and experimental methods to investigate structure-activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and biological activities of diverse chemical compounds. The research spans areas such as medicinal chemistry, environmental toxicology, biodegradation, protein engineering, and quantitative structure-property relationships.

The datasets provide valuable resources for developing and validating computational models in drug design, toxicology prediction, and understanding structure-function relationships of molecules and proteins. They represent a wide range of chemical spaces and biological endpoints, making them useful for benchmarking different modeling approaches and descriptor sets.
