QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine protein kinase MNK, also known as MAP kinase signal integrating kinase, MAPK signal integrating kinase, MKNK, and Mnk. It is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. The protein target classification is Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase MAPKAPK family/CAMK protein kinase MNK subfamily.

This kinase is involved in various cellular processes including regulation of translation, protein phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, and protein autophosphorylation. It is found in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and cytosol. The protein has nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, calmodulin binding, and metal ion binding functions.

The target is associated with several database entries including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is also linked to resources such as canSAR Target, Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, and Reactome.
