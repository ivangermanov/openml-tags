Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate colinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

Friedman is one of the most commonly used functions for data generation. Friedman functions incorporate both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, with normalized noise added to the output. The Friedman function is expressed as:

y = ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus zero point five squared plus ten multiplied by X four plus five multiplied by X five plus e

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To assess the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity.

The colinearity degree represents the number of features depending on other features. The generated Friedman datasets include different numbers of features, samples, and colinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random.

For datasets with higher colinearity degrees, a larger number of features are generated. As a result, numerous artificial datasets are created by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file represents the target variable. The features are labeled as oz followed by numbers.
