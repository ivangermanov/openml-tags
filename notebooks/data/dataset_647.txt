The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is a complex combination of variables, including sine, multiplication, and exponentiation.

To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. Furthermore, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity.

Colinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features. The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values vary across several dimensions. The number of features ranges from a small set to a larger set, while the number of samples also varies. Colinearity degrees range from zero to four, with higher degrees indicating more interdependent features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target variable.
