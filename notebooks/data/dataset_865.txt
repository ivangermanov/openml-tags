The Analcat Data German GSS dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It has undergone significant transformations to convert its multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion process involved relabeling the majority class as positive, denoted by 'P', and all other classes as negative, denoted by 'N'. 

This dataset boasts an array of fascinating features, including political system, age, time of survey, schooling, and region.
