Please cite: Binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on voting patterns and political affiliations. It includes information about individuals' party affiliations and their favorability ratings. The data has been processed to create a binary classification, dividing subjects into positive and negative categories based on their target values in relation to the mean.

The dataset provides valuable insights for political analysis and voter behavior studies. It allows researchers to examine the relationship between party membership and favorability, as well as explore patterns in binary classifications of political attitudes.

Features included in the dataset are:
- Name
- Party
- Favorable
- Binary Class

This binarized version offers a simplified approach to analyzing complex political data, enabling researchers to identify trends and make predictions based on categorical classifications.
