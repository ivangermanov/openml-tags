**Hailfinder Bayesian Network**

This network repository reference can be found on the bnlearn website, specifically on the discrete large section.

The network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of twenty-six fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, and the average degree is two point three six. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Hailfinder network was designed to forecast severe weather conditions. It takes into account various factors such as cloud cover, wind direction, moisture levels, and more to predict the likelihood of hail.

Some of the key features of this network include cloud shade convection, scenario relative instability, morning convective inhibition, and area moisture dry air. These features all play a crucial role in determining the probability of hail.

The Hailfinder network has been used to improve the accuracy of severe weather forecasts and has been cited in numerous scientific studies.
