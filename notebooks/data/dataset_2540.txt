The Titanic dataset is a historical collection of data related to transportation, specifically focusing on predicting the fare paid by passengers. 

A key variable in this dataset is socioeconomic status, which is proxied by the passenger class, categorized into three groups: upper, middle, and lower classes. 

Age is another important variable, which may be represented as a fraction if the individual is less than one year old. In cases where the exact age is unknown, it is estimated and denoted in the format of years and half years.

Family relationships also play a significant role in this dataset. Siblings refer to brothers, sisters, stepbrothers, and stepsisters, while spouses include husbands and wives, excluding mistresses and fianc√©s. 

Parent-child relationships are also defined, encompassing mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, stepdaughters, and stepsons. Notably, some children traveled with their nannies, resulting in a parent-child count of zero for these individuals.

The dataset includes various features, including age, fare, sex, number of siblings and spouses, parent-child count, socioeconomic status, port of embarkation, and survival status.
