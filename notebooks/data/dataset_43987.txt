Ailerons 
Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset addresses a control problem, specifically flying an F16 aircraft. The attributes describe the status of the airplane, while the goal is to predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft. The dataset is comprised of various features that describe the aircraft's performance and status, including its climb rate, pitch, roll, and other relevant metrics. The objective is to use these features to predict the necessary control action to ensure safe and efficient flight.
