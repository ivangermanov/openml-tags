Ailerons 
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the classification on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in the same way as the other datasets in this benchmark. 

The Ailerons dataset belongs to the category of control problems and specifically focuses on flying an F Sixteen aircraft. The attributes in this dataset describe the current status of the airplane, and the ultimate goal is to accurately predict the necessary control action required for the ailerons of the aircraft. 

The dataset features various attributes that capture different aspects of the airplane's status, including its rate of climb, pitch, roll, and other relevant parameters. These attributes have been carefully selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the airplane's behavior, enabling the development of effective predictive models.
