The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset is a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance data encountered in industry. Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain and in particular difficult to publish, we present and provide a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in industry to the best of our knowledge.

The dataset consists of data points stored as rows with features in columns. The features include a unique identifier, product ID, type, air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear, and machine failure. The product ID consists of a letter indicating low, medium, or high product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number. The air temperature is generated using a random walk process and later normalized to a standard deviation around a certain temperature. The process temperature is generated using a random walk process, normalized to a standard deviation, and added to the air temperature plus a certain temperature. The rotational speed is calculated from a power and overlaid with a normally distributed noise. The torque values are normally distributed around a certain value with a standard deviation and no negative values. The tool wear is calculated based on the product quality variants, adding a certain amount of minutes to the used tool in the process.

The machine failure label indicates whether the machine has failed in a particular data point for any of the following failure modes. The machine failure consists of five independent failure modes: tool wear failure, heat dissipation failure, power failure, overstrain failure, and random failures. The tool wear failure occurs when the tool will be replaced or fail at a randomly selected tool wear time. The heat dissipation failure occurs when the difference between air and process temperature is below a certain temperature and the tool's rotational speed is below a certain value. The power failure occurs when the product of torque and rotational speed equals the power required for the process and is below or above a certain value. The overstrain failure occurs when the product of tool wear and torque exceeds a certain value for a particular product variant. The random failures occur when each process has a chance to fail regardless of its process parameters. If at least one of the above failure modes is true, the process fails and the machine failure label is set to one.
