Click Prediction Small Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

This dataset is a subsample of the Click Prediction Small dataset, which has been reduced in size to facilitate faster processing and experimentation. The subsampling process was performed using a random seed of zero, which ensures reproducibility of the results.

The dataset was subsampled to have a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratified sampling method was used to ensure that the class distribution in the subsample is representative of the original dataset.

The features in this dataset include impression, URL, ad identifier, advertiser identifier, depth, position, query identifier, keyword identifier, title identifier, description identifier, and user identifier. The click feature is the target variable.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the classes were uniformly sampled to select the required number of classes. Then, the columns were uniformly sampled to select the required number of columns. Finally, the rows were stratified sampled to select the required number of rows.

The resulting dataset is a smaller and more manageable version of the original Click Prediction Small dataset, which can be used for faster experimentation and prototyping.
