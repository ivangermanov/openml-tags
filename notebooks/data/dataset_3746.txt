QSAR-TID-10222 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10222. The dataset has sixty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10222. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase one enzyme, which is a single protein target.

The Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase one enzyme is a cytosolic aminopeptidase that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including proteolysis and peptide metabolism. It is a metalloprotease that belongs to the M24B subfamily of metalloproteases.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of inhibitors or activators of the Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase one enzyme. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization.
