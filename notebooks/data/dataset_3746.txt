This dataset contains Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10222. The dataset has sixty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Folded Circular Fingerprint 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10222.

Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidase One is a single protein, also known as Aminoacylproline Aminopeptidase, Cytosolic Aminopeptidase P, and Soluble Aminopeptidase P. It is an enzyme that belongs to the Metallo Protease MG Clan and Metallo Protease M24B Subfamily.

The dataset is related to the species Homo sapiens and is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MG clan/Metallo protease M24B subfamily.
