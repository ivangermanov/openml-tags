Entering a cognitive state of flow is a natural response of the mind that allows people to fully concentrate and cope with tedious and often repetitive tasks. Understanding how to trigger or sustain flow remains limited by retrospective surveys, presenting a need to better document flow. This dataset is used to study flow in the context of a flow-inducing task, namely braid making. Using an instrumented Kumihimo braid making tool and off-the-shelf biosignal wristbands, we record the experiences of users engaged in different braid making tasks. We extract features motivated from flow literature from activity data, including movement and physiological signals, and annotate them with Flow Short Scale scores.

Unlike the Braid Flow dataset, this dataset provides session-level data, specifically features computed on a sliding window. The features include user identification, task identification, window information, and various metrics related to braid making, movement, and physiological signals.

The braid making metrics include statistics on revolutions, strands, and trials. The movement metrics include acceleration, speed, and heading movements. The physiological signals include heart rate, skin temperature, electrodermal activity, and electromyography.

The dataset also includes demographic information, such as age, gender, and ethnicity, as well as information on dexterity, needlecraft engagement, and proficiency.

Keywords: flow state, braid making, cognitive concentration, physiological signals, movement metrics, demographic information.
