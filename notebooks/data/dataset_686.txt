This dataset contains the monthly number of tourist arrivals in Cyprus, starting from January 1979 and ending in December 2000. It provides a comprehensive time series of tourism data for Cyprus over a 22-year period, allowing for analysis of trends and patterns in visitor numbers.

The dataset is classified as numeric, with no specific class index. It includes features such as year, month, and arrivals, providing a detailed breakdown of tourist influx over time. This information can be valuable for researchers, policymakers, and tourism industry professionals studying seasonal trends, long-term growth patterns, and factors influencing tourism in Cyprus.

The data is part of a larger collection used in the book 'Regression Models for Time Series Analysis', suggesting its relevance for statistical analysis and modeling of time-dependent phenomena. Researchers interested in time series analysis, particularly in the context of tourism and seasonal patterns, may find this dataset particularly useful.
