This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification results in a clear distinction between the two classes.

The dataset includes various features that provide insight into different aspects of running shoes. These features include information about the individual, such as their gender and marital status, as well as details about their running habits, including the frequency and distance of their runs. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the type of running shoes used and other relevant factors.
