QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, also known as Beta platelet-derived growth factor receptor, Beta-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor, CD antigen-like family member B, and CD antigen. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase PDGFR family.

Several molecules interact with this target, including CDP, Imatinib, TG, Rinucumab, and Telatinib. These compounds act as Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta inhibitors and are at various phases of development and approval.

The protein is involved in numerous cellular processes and is found in various cellular components including the nucleus, cytoplasm, lysosome, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and focal adhesions. Its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, and growth factor binding.

The protein participates in many biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, chemotaxis, signal transduction, cell migration, and regulation of cell proliferation. It plays a role in several signaling pathways including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling pathway, vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, and phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling.

This target is associated with various databases and resources including ExpressionAtlas, Gene Ontology, Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
