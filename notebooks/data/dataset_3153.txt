This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta, and it has many rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and many others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

The target is Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta, also known as Beta Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor, Beta-Type Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor, CD one hundred forty antigen-like family member B, CD one hundred forty b, PDGFR, and many other synonyms. It is an enzyme, specifically a protein kinase, belonging to the Tyrosine Protein Kinase group and PDGFR family. 

It is involved in various biological processes, including cell migration, chemotaxis, signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and many others. 

Some molecules that interact with this target include Imatinib, Telatinib, and many others.
