The COMET experiment, currently under construction at the J-PARC proton beam laboratory in Japan, aims to detect the coherent neutrino-less conversion of a muon to an electron, μ- + N(A,Z) → e- + N(A,Z), a process that violates the law of lepton conservation. If successful, this discovery would signify new physics beyond our current understanding.

The Cylindrical Drift Chamber is the primary detector for physics measurements in COMET Phase-I. Specifically, the momentum of resulting particles will be measured using the CyDet, a cylindrical wire array detector. The particles flying out of the muon-stopping target and registered by the CyDet include tracks left by electrons with specific energy, produced by muon to electron conversion. The CyDet consists of 4482 sensitive wires organized in 18 layers, each wire measuring the energy deposited by a passing charged particle.

Within each layer, the wires have the same distance to the stopping target and stereometric angle. A magnetic field in the detector causes electrons to move in helical paths, depositing energy in wires close to their flight path. The radius of the helix is proportional to the transverse momentum of the electron: R = pt / (eB), where pt is the transverse momentum, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and e is the charge of the electron.

The energy deposited on each wire is measured at the end plate of the cylindrical detector. An example of a resulting signal event shows blue dots representing background hits and red dots representing hits from signal electrons.

The data format includes information about the position of straw tubes, kept in a supplementary file, with details such as wire_id, wire_rho, and wire_phi. Each event is a snapshot of the detector, consisting of data taken from all 4482 wires, including energy and relative time. Events are written only when the hodoscope detects a particle. Relative time is the difference between the time when the straw tube detected energy and the time of the hodoscope.

Data is organized with columns for event_id, wire_id, global_id, energy, relative_time, and label (0 for non-activated or background, 1 for signal hits). Wires with zero energy deposition are not activated.
