CPMP 2015 Runtime Regression

Tags: Algorithm Selection

This dataset is an extension of the 2013 pre-marshalling dataset, featuring a more comprehensive set of features and a collection of test instances. The dataset includes three distinct sets of features, each with its own unique characteristics. The first set, feature values, contains the full range of features derived from the second iteration of our latent feature analysis process. The second set, feature values iteration one, includes only the features obtained after the first iteration of the latent feature analysis process. The third set, feature values original, comprises the features used in the original 2013 pre-marshalling dataset.

In addition to these feature sets, the dataset also provides test data with an identical naming scheme. Notably, the features for the pre-marshalling problem are extremely easy and fast to compute, which is why the feature costs file has been omitted, as it would indicate a computation time of zero for every feature.

The feature computation code is available online, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the feature extraction process. Previously, this scenario was referred to as Pre-Marshalling-AStar-2015, but it has been renamed to conserve space.

The dataset features a range of attributes, including the number of stacks, tiers, and the stack to tier ratio, as well as container density, empty stack percentage, and overstowing stack percentage. Other features include group same minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation, top good minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation, overstowage percentage, and bottom floor left behind. The dataset also includes algorithm and runtime information, along with a unique row identifier.
