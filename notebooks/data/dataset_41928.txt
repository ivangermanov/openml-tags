The Container Pre-Marshalling Problem Runtime Regression dataset is an extension of the previous dataset, featuring more attributes and a set of test instances. Three distinct sets of attributes are included: one containing the comprehensive set of attributes derived from the second iteration of our Latent Feature Analysis process; another consisting of attributes obtained after the first iteration; and finally, the original attributes utilized in the Premarshalling Astar dataset.

In addition to these attribute files, corresponding test data is provided, following an identical naming convention. It is worth noting that the calculation of attributes for the Premarshalling Problem is exceptionally straightforward and rapid; consequently, the attribute costs file has been omitted, as its values would uniformly be zero, regardless of whether original, first iteration, or second iteration attributes are employed. The attribute computation code is accessible via an online repository.

This dataset was previously referred to as Premarshalling Astar; however, to conserve storage space, the name was modified. The attributes encompass various aspects, including stack properties, container density, and group characteristics.
