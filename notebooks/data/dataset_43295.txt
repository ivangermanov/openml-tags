Pair0001 is a dataset consisting of Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) data collected from three hundred forty-nine stations. The data was obtained from the official website of Deutscher Wetterdienst, which provides climate and environmental data for Germany. The specific webpage where the data was downloaded has been archived since January 2010.

The dataset contains information about the average temperature measured at each station between 1961 and 1990. The x-axis represents the altitude of each station, while the y-axis represents the corresponding average temperature reading. This dataset is particularly useful for graphical models and machine learning applications, especially those focused on environmental and climate-related topics.
