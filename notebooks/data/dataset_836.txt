Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Brain, liver, time, treat, days, sex, weight, loss, binary class

This dataset, known as Sleuth Case, is a modified version of an original dataset from an unknown source. The modification process involved binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset encompasses various features related to biological and temporal factors, including brain and liver measurements, treatment duration, sex, weight changes, and a binary classification. The exact origin and date of the original dataset remain undisclosed. Researchers utilizing this dataset are advised to properly cite it as a binarized adaptation of the primary source.
