QSAR-TID-100624 Dataset

The QSAR-TID-100624 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100624. This dataset has one hundred twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September two thousand fifteen. It shows the activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred sixty-two four, and it has one hundred twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features in this dataset include molecule ChEMBL ID, and median PXc fifty, among others. These features were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The QSAR-TID-one hundred sixty-two four dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying the activity of compounds on drug targets.
