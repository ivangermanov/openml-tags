Dataset: LSVT Voice Rehabilitation Data Set
Tags: study, study, study

The LSVT Voice Rehabilitation Data Set was created by researchers at the University of Oxford. It contains samples from participants and features, with the aim of assessing whether voice rehabilitation treatment leads to phonations considered 'acceptable' or 'unacceptable' (a binary class classification problem).

The original research demonstrated that it is possible to correctly replicate experts' binary assessment with approximately accuracy using both fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out validation. The researchers experimented with both random forests and support vector machines, using standard approaches for optimizing the SVM's hyperparameters. It would be interesting if other researchers could improve on this finding using advanced machine learning tools.

Each attribute (feature) in the dataset corresponds to the application of a speech signal processing algorithm which aims to characterize the signal objectively. These algorithms include standard perturbation analysis methods, wavelet-based features, fundamental frequency-based features, and tools used to mine nonlinear time-series. Due to the extensive number of attributes, interested readers are referred to the relevant papers for further details.

The dataset was introduced in a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering. Further details about the speech signal processing algorithms can be found in additional publications, including a doctoral thesis and papers presented at international symposiums.

The features in the dataset are labeled as V followed by a number, with over features in total. These features represent various aspects of speech signal analysis and processing.

This dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying voice rehabilitation, particularly in the context of Parkinson's disease. It offers opportunities for developing and testing machine learning algorithms to assess speech treatment outcomes objectively.
