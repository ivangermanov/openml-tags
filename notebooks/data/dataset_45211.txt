Andes Bayesian Network. Sample 3.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 
This dataset is a discrete-verylarge Bayesian network.

The Andes Bayesian Network is a complex network consisting of nodes and arcs. It has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is moderate, and the average degree is relatively low. The maximum in-degree is six.

This network is a representation of online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It is a powerful tool for modeling student behavior and providing personalized feedback.

The network features a wide range of variables, including goal-oriented nodes, resolve nodes, choose nodes, and identify nodes. These variables are interconnected to model the complex relationships between student behavior and problem-solving outcomes.

Keywords: Bayesian network, student modeling, problem solving, online learning, personalized feedback.
