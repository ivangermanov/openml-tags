This dataset is composed of features extracted from seven videos with people gesticulating, aiming at studying Gesture Phase Segmentation. Each video is represented by two files: a raw file, which contains the position of hands, wrists, head, and spine of the user in each frame; and a processed file, which contains velocity and acceleration of hands and wrists.

The dataset is the processed data set with the following feature description: Processed files contain thirty-two numeric attributes and a class attribute. A feature vector with up to fifty numeric attributes can be generated with the two files mentioned above.

The dataset is related to the study of Gesture Unit Segmentation using Support Vector Machines, Gesture Unit Segmentation Using Spatial-Temporal Information and Machine Learning, and Support Vector Machines and Gesture Analysis incorporating temporal aspects.

The dataset is provided by the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Please cite the dataset according to the Machine Learning Repository's citation policy. Additionally, the authors require a citation to one or more publications from those cited as relevant papers.
