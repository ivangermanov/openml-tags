QSAR-TID-101405 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101405. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains multiple molecular fingerprints, including FCFP6 1024 0, FCFP6 1024 1, FCFP6 1024 2, and so on.

Scraped Data:
