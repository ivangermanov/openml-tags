This dataset is part of a collection of datasets based on the game Jungle Chess, also known as Dou Shou Qi. For a description of the rules, please refer to the paper. The paper also contains a description of various constructed features.

As the table bases are a disjoint set of several table bases based on which two pieces are on the board, we have uploaded all table bases that have explicit different content: Rat versus Rat, Rat versus Panther, Rat versus Lion, Rat versus Elephant, Panther versus Lion, Panther versus Elephant, Tiger versus Lion, Lion versus Lion, Lion versus Elephant, Elephant versus Elephant, Complete (Combination of the above), and RAW Complete (Combination of the above, containing for both pieces just the rank, file, and strength information).

This dataset contains a similar classification problem as, for example, the King and Rook versus King problem and is suitable for classification tasks. Note that this dataset is one of the above-mentioned datasets. Additionally, note that several sub-problems are very similar. Having seen a given position from one of the table bases arguably gives a lot of information about the outcome of the same position in the other table bases.

The dataset consists of various features including White Piece Zero Strength, White Piece Zero File, White Piece Zero Rank, and so on. It also includes Black Piece Zero Strength, Black Piece Zero File, Black Piece Zero Rank, and many more.
