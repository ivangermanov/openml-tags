The Weather Problem dataset is a small collection of data that we will utilize repeatedly to demonstrate various machine learning techniques. This entirely fictional dataset supposedly revolves around the ideal conditions for engaging in an unspecified outdoor activity or game.

In general, each instance within a dataset is defined by the values of its features, which are also referred to as attributes, measuring distinct aspects of said instance. In the context of the Weather Problem dataset, there exist four primary attributes: the overall outlook, the ambient temperature, the relative humidity, and the presence or absence of wind. The ultimate outcome or decision is whether or not to participate in the aforementioned outdoor activity.
