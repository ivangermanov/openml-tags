This directory contains six databases, corresponding test sets, and documentation related to thyroid disease. The databases were obtained from the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia, and were left at the University of California at Irvine during a visit in nineteen eighty-seven for the Machine Learning Workshop.

The documentation files provide information about the databases, including the source, number and names of attributes, and types of values that each attribute takes. The databases are quite similar and can be characterized as having many attributes, mostly numeric or Boolean valued, with several missing attribute values signified by a question mark.

The databases are related to thyroid disease domains and contain a small number of classes. Each data set has a large number of instances, with a corresponding test set that appears to be disjoint with respect to the data set.

The instances in the databases are followed by a vertical bar and a patient identification number. The vertical bar is interpreted by certain algorithms as "ignore the remainder of this line".

In addition to the original six databases, two more data files have been added, which have a similar data format and set of attributes, but their integrity is questionable. These databases differ in terms of their number of instances and lack of corresponding test files. They each have two concepts and contain several missing values.

Another file has been added that contains the latest version of an archive of thyroid diagnoses obtained from the Garavan Institute, consisting of a large number of records from nineteen eighty-four to early nineteen eighty-seven. A domain theory related to thyroid disease has also been added.

The files were donated by various sources, including the Garavan Institute and Stefan Aberhard. The databases are suited for training artificial neural networks and include cost data.
