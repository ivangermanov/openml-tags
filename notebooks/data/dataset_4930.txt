Insurance Bayesian Network Sample 0

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, specifically listed under discrete-medium models.

The Insurance network consists of twenty-seven nodes connected by fifty-two arcs, resulting in one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point one nine, while the average degree is roughly three point eight five. The maximum in-degree of any node is three.

This network is designed to model various factors influencing car insurance premiums. It takes into account aspects such as driving history, skill level, age, vehicle characteristics, and socioeconomic status. These variables interact and influence each other, ultimately affecting the risk assessment and premium calculation for an individual policyholder.

Features of this network include driving history, driving skill, age, vehicle year, mileage, anti-theft devices, airbags, medical costs, and socioeconomic indicators.
