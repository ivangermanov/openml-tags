ALARM Dataset

Tags: Graphical models, MaRDI, TA3

The ALARM (A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism) is a Bayesian network designed to provide an alarm message system for patient monitoring. The alarm dataset contains a comprehensive set of variables that are crucial for patient monitoring.

The dataset includes variables such as Central Venous Pressure, which is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Similarly, Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure is also a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. History is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Total Peripheral Resistance is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Blood Pressure is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Cardiac Output is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Heart Rate/Blood Pressure is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Heart Rate measured by an EKG monitor is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Heart Rate/Oxygen Saturation is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Pulmonary Artery Pressure is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Arterial Oxygen Saturation is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Fraction of Inspired Oxygen is a two-level factor with levels Low and Normal. Breathing Pressure is a four-level factor with levels Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Expelled CO2 is a four-level factor with levels Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Minimum Volume is a four-level factor with levels Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Minimum Volume Set is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High.

The dataset also includes variables related to patient conditions, such as Hypovolemia, which is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Left Ventricular Failure is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Anaphylaxis is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Insufficient Anesthesia/Analgesia is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Pulmonary Embolus is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Intubation is a three-level factor with levels Normal, Esophageal, and Onesided. Kinked Tube is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Disconnection is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Volume is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Stroke Volume is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Catecholamine is a two-level factor with levels Normal and High. Error Low Output is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Heart Rate is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Electrocauter is a two-level factor with levels True and False. Shunt is a two-level factor with levels Normal and High. Pulmonary Venous Oxygen Saturation is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Arterial CO2 is a three-level factor with levels Low, Normal, and High. Pulmonary Alveoli Ventilation is a four-level factor with levels Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Lung Ventilation is a four-level factor with levels Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Ventilation Tube is a four-level factor with levels Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Ventilation Machine is a four-level factor with levels Zero, Low, Normal, and High.
