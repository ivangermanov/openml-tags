This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred four thousand one hundred thirty-eight, and it has sixty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.
