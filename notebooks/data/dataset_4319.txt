This is perhaps the best-known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. The Iris dataset is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains three classes of instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

Features include characteristics of the plants such as length and width of sepals and petals.

The instances in this dataset represent individual plants.

Additional information about the Iris dataset reveals that it is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and is widely used in statistics and machine learning. The data set contains three classes of instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain.

It is worth noting that there are no missing values in this dataset.
