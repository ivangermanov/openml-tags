Name: DNA Seed Four Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the DNA dataset with seed four, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the dataset by uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows. It starts by selecting classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. Finally, it stratifies the data according to the target variable and selects the required number of rows.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, including the categorical mask and column names.
