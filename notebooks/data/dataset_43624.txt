The Historical Product Demand dataset, tagged under Computer Systems and Machine Learning, offers tremendous potential for predictive modeling. Despite its simplicity, the dataset contains valuable information that can be leveraged to improve demand forecasting.

With trivial models, it is possible to significantly reduce the mean average forecasting error, thereby capturing a substantial portion of the total volume ordered. This achievement demonstrates the inherent predictive capabilities present within the dataset, waiting to be fully explored.

To further develop this research, it is recommended that future studies utilize a selection of past months to generate forecasts. Additionally, incorporating warehouse and category data into the model could yield more accurate results. Another approach would be to predict normalized categories of order commands using a classifier instead of a linear model. Furthermore, evaluating models based on their AIC, BIC, and AICc scores would provide valuable insights into their performance.
