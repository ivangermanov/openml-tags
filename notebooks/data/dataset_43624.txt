Historical Product Demand Tags: Source

This dataset only contains five variables: Product Code, Warehouse, Product Category, Date, and Order Demand. It has been demonstrated that, with simple models, it is possible to lower the mean average forecasting error to a relatively low level, thereby capturing a significant proportion of the total volume ordered. This suggests that there is a significant predicting potential in this dataset waiting to be exploited.

If the reader wishes to continue this work, it is recommended that they use only a selection of the past months to make the forecast. Other ideas for further development include utilizing warehouse and category data in the model, predicting normalized categories of order demand, and employing a classifier instead of a linear model. Additionally, it would be beneficial to check for AIC, BIC, and AICc scores.
