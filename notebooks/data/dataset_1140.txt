**Description**
The Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset is a collection of measurements from sixteen chemical sensors used in simulations for drift compensation in a discrimination task of six gases at various levels of concentrations. The goal is to achieve good performance or minimal degradation over time.

**Sources**
This dataset is provided to make it freely accessible online to the chemo-sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor/concept drift.

**Dataset Information**
This archive contains measurements gathered within thirty-six months in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.

**Attribute Information**
The response of the said sensors is read-out in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor. Hence, each measurement produces a sixteen-channel time series, each of which represents an aggregate of features reflecting all the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: the so-called steady-state feature, defined as the difference of the maximal resistance change and the baseline, and its normalized version expressed by the ratio of the maximal resistance and the baseline values when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber; and an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement procedure under controlled conditions, namely the exponential moving average.
