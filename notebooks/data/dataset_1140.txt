Please cite: GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be used for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be utilized for estimating various quality metrics such as accuracy, precision, and area under ROC curve for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms. This repository was created in response to an increasing demand in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems. By providing a standardized set of datasets, researchers can compare different classification and feature selection techniques on the same set of problems, enabling more meaningful comparisons across studies.

Origin of data: Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available expO (Expression Project For Oncology) repository maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without intellectual property restrictions. This approach provides direct benefits to patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on several factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype phenotype studies, and the large number of samples available for different tumor types.

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, it is important to acknowledge the assistance received by using this repository. This practice helps others obtain the same datasets and replicate experiments. Researchers are also encouraged to acknowledge the contribution of expO (Expression Project For Oncology) and the International Genomics Consortium for providing their gene expression samples to the public.

Features: The dataset includes numerous gene expression features, represented by probe set identifiers. These features correspond to various genes and transcripts measured in the microarray experiments. Due to the large number of features, they have been omitted from this summary for brevity.
