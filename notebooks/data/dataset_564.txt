This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The conversion process involved changing the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features related to mortality rates, environmental conditions, and air pollutants. These features include total mortality rate, respiratory mortality rate, cardiovascular mortality rate, temperature, relative humidity, and different types of pollutants present in the air.
