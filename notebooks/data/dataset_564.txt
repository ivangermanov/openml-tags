Fried Dataset

This is an artificial data set used in various studies, including multivariate adaptive regression splines and bagging predictors. The cases are generated using a specific method. First, the values of ten attributes, namely Attribute One, Attribute Two, and so on up to Attribute Ten, are generated independently, each of which is uniformly distributed over zero to one. Then, the value of the target variable, Response Variable, is obtained using a complex equation.

The equation involves a combination of trigonometric functions, polynomial terms, and random noise. Specifically, the response variable is calculated as ten times the sine of pi times Attribute One multiplied by Attribute Two, plus twenty times the square of Attribute Three minus point five, plus ten times Attribute Four, plus five times Attribute Five, plus some random noise from a standard normal distribution.

This dataset has been made available online as part of a collection of regression datasets. It is characterized by forty thousand seven hundred sixty-eight cases, each with eleven continuous attributes. The dataset has been referenced in several academic papers, including one on multivariate adaptive regression splines and another on bagging predictors.
