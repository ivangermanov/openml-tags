Please cite: This is an artificial data set used in a study and also described in another publication. The cases are generated using the following method:

Generate the values of attributes, X through X, independently, each of which is uniformly distributed over a range. Obtain the value of the target variable Y using the equation:

Y = sin(pi * X * X) + (X - .)^2 + X + X + sigma(,)

This dataset is artificially generated for regression studies. It involves multiple independent variables and a target variable calculated using a complex equation. The data is designed to test various regression techniques and predictive models. The dataset has been used in multiple academic publications and is part of a larger collection of regression datasets. It provides a controlled environment for studying the performance of different statistical and machine learning algorithms.
