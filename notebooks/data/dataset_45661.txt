Simulated Physiochemical Protein Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Sciences 

See the GitHub repository at https://github.com/slds-lmu/paper_ci_for_ge for a detailed description of this dataset. This dataset comprises various features that characterize physiochemical properties of proteins, including molecular flexibility, electrostatic potential, and structural similarity. The features included in this dataset are Root Mean Square Deviation, which is a measure of the average distance between atoms in two superimposed proteins.

Keywords: protein structure, physiochemical properties, molecular flexibility, electrostatic potential, structural similarity.
