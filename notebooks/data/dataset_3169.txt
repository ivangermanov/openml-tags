QSAR TID Dataset

Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Pyrimidinergic receptor PY, also known as NRU PP PRY PY purinoceptor. This receptor is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor subfamily and nucleotide like receptor category.

The PY receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, phospholipase C activating signaling, regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, transepithelial chloride transport, and cellular responses to ATP and prostaglandin E stimuli. It also plays a role in regulating presynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration and synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

This receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane, with specific presence in basolateral and apical plasma membranes, as well as in presynaptic active zone membranes and glutamatergic synapses. Its molecular functions include G protein coupled receptor activity, protein binding, ATP binding, and specific activity as a G protein coupled UTP receptor.

The dataset provides information on compounds that interact with the PY receptor, including their molecular structures and activity levels. This data is valuable for quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies, which aim to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their structural properties.
