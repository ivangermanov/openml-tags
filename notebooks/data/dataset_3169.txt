MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y4, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and multiple FCFP features.

The Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y4 is a Single Protein with the Preferred Name Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y4 and Synonyms including NRU, P2P, P2RY4, and P2Y Purinoceptor Four. It is a type of Membrane Receptor, specifically a Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor, and a Small Molecule Receptor. Its description involves being a Purine Receptor.

The dataset includes information about the compound Diquafosol, which is a small molecule and a Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y4 Agonist.

The Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y4 is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, transepithelial chloride transport, G protein-coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor signaling pathway, cellular response to ATP, cellular response to prostaglandin E stimulus, regulation of presynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration, and regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.
