The QSAR-TID-100107 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on a specific drug target. This dataset has forty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features in this dataset represent Fingerprints of six-point pharmacophore features with a diameter of one thousand twenty-four bits, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These Fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated. The dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

This dataset is suitable for machine learning and QSAR modeling studies, particularly those focused on predicting the activity of compounds against a specific drug target. By analyzing the relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding activity values, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of action and identify potential lead compounds for further development.
