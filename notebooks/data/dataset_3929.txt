QSAR-TID-11010 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mineralocorticoid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mineralocorticoid Receptor. The data has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Mineralocorticoid Receptor is a single protein, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Three Group C Member Two, and is a transcription factor and nuclear receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of blood volume by renal aldosterone, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.

The receptor is also involved in signal transduction, intracellular sodium ion homeostasis, and renal sodium excretion. It is a target for the treatment of various diseases, including hypertension and heart failure.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
