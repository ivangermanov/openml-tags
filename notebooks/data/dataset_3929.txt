The QSAR-TID-11010 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11010. The dataset has twenty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset contains information about the mineralocorticoid receptor, which is also known as nuclear receptor subfamily three group C member two. It is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including transcription, signal transduction, and regulation of blood volume.

The mineralocorticoid receptor is primarily located in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. It also interacts with other proteins, such as histone acetyltransferases and zinc ions, to modulate its activity.

In addition to its role in regulating gene expression, the mineralocorticoid receptor is also involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell population proliferation, potassium ion homeostasis, and presynaptic modulation of chemical synaptic transmission.

This dataset provides valuable insights into the structure and function of the mineralocorticoid receptor, which is an important target for the development of new therapeutic agents.
