QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a serine/threonine protein kinase called PAK (also known as p activated kinase, PAK, or PAK). This protein is classified as an enzyme in the kinase family, specifically in the STE protein kinase group, STE protein kinase STE family, and STE protein kinase PAKB subfamily. It is found in Homo sapiens and is involved in various cellular processes including cell growth regulation, protein phosphorylation, apoptosis, cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle, signal transduction, cell migration, MAPK cascade regulation, angiogenesis, dendritic spine development, and cell cell adhesion.

The protein is associated with multiple cellular components including the cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, adherens junction, and focal adhesion. Its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and cadherin binding involved in cell cell adhesion. The dataset also includes information on related molecules, such as PF, a small molecule that acts as a serine/threonine protein kinase PAK inhibitor.

Various databases and resources provide additional information about this protein, including Gene Ontology annotations, protein interaction data, pharmacological data, and structural information from the Protein Data Bank. The protein is also referenced in multiple pathways in the Reactome database, particularly those involving GTPase cycles of various RAC and RHO proteins.
