QSAR-TID-100080 Tags: Human Activities, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand eighty, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id.
