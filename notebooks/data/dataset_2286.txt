The QSAR-TID-12173 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12173. This dataset has one hundred fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The drug target is the Dopamine D four receptor, also known as the D two C dopamine receptor, Dopamine D four receptor, and Drd four. It belongs to the species group Rattus norvegicus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.

This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including behavioral fear response, synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and response to amphetamine. It is also related to certain diseases, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
