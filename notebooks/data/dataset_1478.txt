Human Activity Recognition database built from recordings of subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. This dataset version contains all the training and testing examples provided in the original data repository. The experiments have been carried out with a group of volunteers within an age bracket of years. Each person performed six activities (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, researchers captured axial linear acceleration and axial angular velocity at a constant rate of Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of seconds and overlap (readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low-frequency components, therefore a filter with Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
