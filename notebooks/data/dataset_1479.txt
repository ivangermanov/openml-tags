Hill Valley Dataset

Tags: artificial, OpenML, study

Source: UCI

This dataset represents points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order as the Y coordinate, the points create either a Hill (a "bump" in the terrain) or a Valley (a "dip" in the terrain). The original source provides examples of these graphs. This version is non-noisy, with training and test sets merged.

Attribute Information:
The first hundred attributes are labeled "X" followed by a number. These are floating point values representing the Y-values of the graphs. The final attribute is labeled "class" and is binary, with 0 representing a valley and 1 representing a hill.

Features:
The features are labeled V1 through V100, representing the Y-values at each point on the graph. There is one additional feature representing the class (hill or valley).

Each record in the dataset represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When these points are plotted in sequence, they form either a hill-like or valley-like shape. This dataset is particularly useful for studying terrain classification and pattern recognition in topographical data.

The non-noisy nature of this dataset version allows for cleaner analysis of the underlying patterns in the hill and valley formations. By merging the training and test sets, researchers can work with a comprehensive dataset for developing and evaluating classification algorithms.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for machine learning practitioners and researchers interested in terrain analysis, pattern recognition, and binary classification problems. It provides a unique challenge in distinguishing between two similar but distinct topographical features based on a series of data points.
