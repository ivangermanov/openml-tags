Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi class target feature is converted to a two class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes labeled as "att" followed by numbers, representing various pixel-based features extracted from images. The exact nature and meaning of these attributes are not specified in the given information.

The mfeat pixel dataset is a modified version of an original image classification dataset. It has been transformed into a binary classification problem by grouping the majority class as positive and all other classes as negative. This binarization process simplifies the original multi-class problem into a two-class problem, which can be useful for certain machine learning algorithms or research purposes. The dataset likely contains pixel-based features extracted from images, though the specific details of these features are not provided.
