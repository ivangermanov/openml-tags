The original dataset for ECG Five Thousand is a twenty hour long electrocardiogram downloaded from PhysioNet. The name is BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database and it is record chf zero seven. 

This dataset was preprocessed in two steps: first, extracting each heartbeat, and second, making each heartbeat equal in length using interpolation. 

This dataset was originally used in a research paper titled A General Framework for Never Ending Learning from Time Series Streams. After that, five thousand heartbeats were randomly selected. The patient has severe congestive heart failure and the class values were obtained through automated annotation.

Features include various columns representing different aspects of the electrocardiogram.
