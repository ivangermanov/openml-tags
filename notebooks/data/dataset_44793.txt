The original dataset for ECG Five Thousand is a twenty-hour long electrocardiogram downloaded from PhysioNet. The name is BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database, and it is record chf zero seven. This dataset was originally published in a research resource for complex physiologic signals. The data was pre-processed in two steps: first, each heartbeat was extracted, and second, each heartbeat was made equal length using interpolation. This dataset was originally used in a paper about a general framework for never-ending learning from time series streams. After that, five thousand heartbeats were randomly selected. The patient has severe congestive heart failure, and the class values were obtained by automated annotation.

The dataset contains a large number of features, including various electrocardiogram readings.
