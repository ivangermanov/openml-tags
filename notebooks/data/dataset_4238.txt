## **Meta Album Airplanes Dataset (Micro)** 

The original Airplanes dataset comprises more than nine thousand remote sensing images acquired from Google Earth satellite imagery, including twenty-one different types of aircraft from around thirty-six airports. All the images were carefully labeled by specialists in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. Each class can have a varying number of images, where each image contains only one complete aircraft, and they have variable resolutions.
