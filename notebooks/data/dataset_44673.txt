Phishing Websites Dataset Subsampling with Seed Zero

This dataset is a subsampling of the Phishing Websites dataset with a seed of zero. The subsampling was done using a specific set of arguments, including a maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, as well as a stratification parameter.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of columns, and then sampling rows from the resulting dataset. The goal was to create a smaller dataset that still retains the essential characteristics of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including whether the URL has an IP address, the length of the URL, the presence of a shortening service, and the presence of an at symbol. Other features include the prefix and suffix of the URL, the presence of a subdomain, the final state of the SSL certificate, and the length of time the domain has been registered.

The dataset also includes features related to the website's favicon, port, and HTTPS token, as well as the URL of the anchor and the links in tags. Additionally, it includes features related to submitting to email, abnormal URLs, redirects, and mouseover events. The dataset also includes features related to the age of the domain, DNS records, web traffic, page rank, and Google index.

The dataset is designed to be used for machine learning and data analysis tasks, and is particularly useful for training models to detect phishing websites.
