Scraped Data: Dataset Information

Additional Information 
The dataset comprises four sets of mobile sensor readings data, specifically humidity and temperature, corresponding to a swarm of four Unmanned Surface Vehicles. Each Unmanned Surface Vehicle set contains records of the format: Unmanned Surface Vehicle Identification, humidity value, temperature value, experiment identification, and sensing time. 

The swarm of the Unmanned Surface Vehicles is moving according to a GPS pre-defined trajectory, whose relative waypoints are specified in the README file. The Unmanned Surface Vehicles are floating over the sea surface in a coastal area of Athens, Greece.
