QSAR-TID-108 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 108. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data was obtained from ChEMBL version 17 and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints.

The serotonin 2c receptor is a protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various physiological processes, including behavioral fear response, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, and signal transduction.

The receptor is activated by serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including mood, appetite, and sleep. The receptor is also involved in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion and the release of sequestered calcium ion into cytosol.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop QSAR models that can predict the activity of compounds on the serotonin 2c receptor. The models can be used to identify potential drug candidates and to optimize their activity.
