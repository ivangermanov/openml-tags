Mushroom Records Drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms

Features: class, cap shape, cap surface, cap color, bruises, odor, gill attachment, gill spacing, gill size, gill color, stalk shape, stalk root, stalk surface above ring, stalk surface below ring, stalk color above ring, stalk color below ring, veil type, veil color, ring number, ring type, spore print color, population, habitat

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to twenty-three species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
