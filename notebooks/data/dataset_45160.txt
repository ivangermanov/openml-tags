This network consists of thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, and the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium model.
