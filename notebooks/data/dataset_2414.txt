GAMETES Epistasis Two Way Artificial Selection Dataset 

Tags: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Text and Literature 

This dataset focuses on epistasis, which refers to the phenomenon where the effect of one gene on a trait is dependent on the presence of one or more other genes. The GAMETES Epistasis Two Way Artificial Selection dataset is specifically designed to study this complex relationship between genes. 

Features: This extensive dataset includes a wide range of attributes, including numerous genetic markers, each denoted by a unique identifier. While these identifiers may appear cryptic, they represent essential components of the genetic code being analyzed.
