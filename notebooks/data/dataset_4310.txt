**Meta-Album: MPII Human Pose Dataset (Extended)**

The MPII Human Pose dataset is a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating articulated human pose estimation. It includes approximately twenty-five thousand images containing over forty thousand people with annotated body joints. The images were systematically collected using an established taxonomy of everyday human activities. Overall, the dataset covers four hundred ten human activities, and each image is provided with an activity label. Each image was extracted from a YouTube video. Like other Meta-Album datasets, this dataset is preprocessed, and all images are resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels.
