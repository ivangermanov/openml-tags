BNG (Dermatology, Nominal)

Features:

This skin condition is characterized by erythema, which is a redness of the skin, accompanied by scaling, and has definite borders. Itching is a common symptom, and the Koebner phenomenon may be observed. The skin lesions may appear as polygonal papules or follicular papules. Oral mucosal involvement may occur, and the knees and elbows are often affected. Scalp involvement is also possible.

A family history of the condition may be present, and upon examination, melanin incontinence may be noted. Eosinophils may be found in the infiltrate, which is a characteristic feature of this condition. The infiltrate may also exhibit PNL characteristics.

Histopathological examination reveals fibrosis of the papillary dermis, exocytosis, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis. Clubbing of the rete ridges and elongation of the rete ridges may be seen. Thinning of the suprapapillary epidermis is another characteristic feature.

Spongiform pustules and Munro microabscesses may be present, along with focal hypergranulosis and disappearance of the granular layer. Vacuolization and damage of the basal layer, spongiosis, and a saw-tooth appearance of the rete ridges may be observed. Follicular horn plugs and perifollicular parakeratosis may also be seen.

The inflammatory infiltrate is typically mononuclear, and a band-like infiltrate may be present.
