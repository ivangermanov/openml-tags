This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-103456, is tagged with Machine Learning and MTLQSAR, and is part of the study three. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103456.

The dataset consists of seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. 

The scrapped data includes information about the protein target, specifically Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Fifteen, which is a single protein. Its preferred name is Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Fifteen, and it belongs to the species group Homo sapiens. 

This protein target classification is described as being involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, and phosphorylation. Additionally, it has been shown to have nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase kinase kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding functions.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, protein target classification, biological processes.
