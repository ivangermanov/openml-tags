This dataset is comprised of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) data for the Tokyo server at Silicon Graphics International (SGI). It characterizes the server performance as either good or bad. The instances are measurements generated by the PCP software every five seconds.

The dataset provides insight into the server's performance, which is crucial for optimizing its efficiency. By analyzing the various attributes, one can identify patterns and correlations that affect the server's overall performance.

### Attribute Information

The attributes are interpreted as follows:

* Run Queue: This attribute represents the average number of runnable processes in main memory and in swap memory during the interval.
* Memory: This attribute includes two sub-attributes: Free, which indicates the average free memory during the interval in kilobytes, and Page, which represents the average number of page out operations per second during the interval. I/O operations caused by these page-out operations are included in the write I/O rate.
* System: This attribute consists of three sub-attributes: System Call Rate, Context Switch Rate, and Interrupt Rate. These rates are expressed as average operations per second during the interval.
* Disks: This attribute aggregates physical read and write rates over all disks, expressed as physical I/O operations issued per second during the interval. These rates are independent of the I/O block size.
* CPU: This attribute represents the percentage of CPU time spent executing user code, system and interrupt code, idle loop, and idle waiting for resources, typically disk I/O.

### Features

Some of the notable features include CPU-related metrics, such as CPU average user time, CPU maximum user time, and CPU busy fraction. Additionally, there are features related to disk activity, network activity, and memory usage.
