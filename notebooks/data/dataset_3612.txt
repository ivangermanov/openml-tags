QSAR-TID-11409 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11409. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 927 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is Dual Specificity Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 1, also known as MAP2K1. It is a protein kinase that plays a key role in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

The protein is a key regulator of the MAPK pathway, which is activated in response to various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and stress signals. The protein phosphorylates and activates MAPK1 and MAPK3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate various downstream targets, leading to changes in gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

The protein is also involved in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. Inhibitors of the protein have been developed as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of these diseases.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for the development of QSAR models and the identification of potential inhibitors of the protein.
