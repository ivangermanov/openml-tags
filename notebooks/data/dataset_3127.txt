QSAR-TID-12689 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12689. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the Serotonin two c receptor, also known as five hydroxytryptamine receptor two c, five ht two c, five ht minus two c, and so forth. It is a single protein and its preferred name is Serotonin two c receptor.

The organism associated with this receptor is Rattus norvegicus, and it belongs to the species group of No Protein Target Classification. Its description is one membrane receptor family a g protein-coupled receptor small molecule receptor family a gpcr monoamine receptor serotonin receptor.

The dataset shows relationships between different proteins and receptors, including the Dopamine D two receptor and Serotonin two receptor.

It also includes information about Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes, such as plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, cell surface, and so forth.

Keywords: QSAR, TID, Serotonin, Receptor, Gene Ontology, Plasma Membrane, Cell Surface.
