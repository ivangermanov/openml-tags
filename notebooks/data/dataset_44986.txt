The Pickup Location ID and Drop-off Location ID attributes identify the TLC Taxi Zone where the trip started and ended, respectively. The Passenger Count attribute represents the number of passengers in the vehicle, as entered by the driver. 

Additionally, the Extra attribute includes miscellaneous extras and surcharges, such as rush hour and overnight charges. The MTA Tax attribute represents the fifty-cent MTA tax that is automatically triggered based on the metered rate in use. 

The Tip Amount attribute is the target feature, representing the amount of tip given by the passenger. The Tolls Amount attribute represents the cost of any tolls incurred during the trip.
