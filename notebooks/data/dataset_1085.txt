Please cite: Data from the RSCTC Discovery Challenge. All datasets contain between one hundred and four hundred samples, characterized by values of twenty thousand to sixty five thousand attributes. Samples are assigned to several (two to ten) classes. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA microarrays. Attributes are normalized in some way - in test data you should expect similar distributions of attribute values as in the example data.
