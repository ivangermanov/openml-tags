Pathfinder Bayesian Network Sample Six

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository provides access to this network, which is characterized as a discrete very large network.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, resulting in a substantial number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the network indicate its complexity.

The Pathfinder project was designed to create normative expert systems, with this Bayesian network being part of the project's first phase. The network represents a model for reasoning under uncertainty in the domain of lymph node pathology diagnosis.

Features of this network include fault diagnosis and various factors influencing diagnosis, although some of these factors may not be easily interpretable due to their notation.
