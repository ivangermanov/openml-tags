QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and various FCFP fingerprint bits.

The dataset describes a serine/threonine protein kinase c TAK also known as Cdc associated protein kinase cTAK CTAK C TAK ELKL motif kinase. It is classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK family/CAMK protein kinase MARK subfamily. The protein is found in Homo sapiens.

Gene ontology annotations indicate the protein is involved in various cellular components including cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, dendrites, and extracellular exosomes. Its molecular functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and tau protein binding. Biological processes it participates in are protein phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, and regulation of hippo signaling.

The protein has entries in multiple databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is associated with MAP/microtubule affinity regulating kinase and involved in signaling pathways such as RAF activation, MAP K activation, and regulation of MAPK pathways.
