QSAR-TID-100140 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100140. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and should be cited accordingly.

The drug target, also known as Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase c-TAK1, is a single protein enzyme that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group and CAMK1 family. It has multiple synonyms, including Cdc25C-Associated Protein Kinase 1, cTAK1, CTAK1, C-TAK1, ELKL Motif Kinase 2, and others.

The enzyme is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, positive regulation of protein binding, negative regulation of Hippo signaling, intracellular signal transduction, and peptidyl-serine autophosphorylation.

It is also associated with multiple cellular components, including cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, cell projection, and extracellular exosome.
