This dataset contains Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Myosin Light Chain Kinase, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent Extended Connectivity Circular Fingerprints (FCFP) which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and provides valuable information for researchers studying the relationship between chemical structures and their biological activities.

The dataset contains information about the compound's molecular structure, including its chemical formula, molecular weight, and other relevant properties. Additionally, it provides activity values measured in terms of pseudo-pIC50, which represents the negative logarithm of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration.

Features include molecule identifiers, FCFP fingerprints, and activity values. The FCFP fingerprints are bit-string representations of molecular structures, which can be used to compare and analyze the similarity of different molecules.

The dataset is particularly useful for researchers interested in studying the properties and activities of compounds targeting Myosin Light Chain Kinase, a key enzyme involved in various cellular processes.

Keywords: QSAR, Myosin Light Chain Kinase, FCFP, SMILES, Pipeline Pilot, MetaQSAR, chemical structure, biological activity, pIC50.
