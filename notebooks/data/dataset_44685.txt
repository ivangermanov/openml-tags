Subsampling of the dataset Christine with seed equals two, maximum number of rows equals two thousand, maximum number of columns equals one hundred, maximum number of classes equals ten, and stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. If the number of classes in the original dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the rows and columns accordingly. If stratified sampling is required, it uses the train test split function from scikit learn to ensure that the new dataset has the same class distribution as the original dataset.
