The Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma dataset, also known as Lymphoma Nine Classes or DLBCL, is a microarray dataset used for gene expression profiling. This dataset is related to social media and transportation. 

Distinct types of diffuse large B cell lymphoma were identified by gene expression profiling. The dataset was published in Nature magazine and provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this type of cancer.

The dataset contains a wide range of genes, including those involved in cellular processes, signaling pathways, and metabolism. These genes are essential for understanding the biological mechanisms driving the development and progression of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
