QSAR-TID-12568 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12568. The dataset has several rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme is a single protein, also known as Ace, and is a metallo protease M2 family enzyme. It is involved in various biological processes, including response to hypoxia, kidney development, angiotensin maturation, and regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by renin-angiotensin.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction of biological activities of small molecules. The project involves the collection and curation of QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL, and the development of predictive models using machine learning and statistical methods.
