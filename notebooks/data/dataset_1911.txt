The QSAR-TID-12720 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 12720. This dataset has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

This dataset is related to health and medicine, specifically the study of QSAR models.

The drug target is the Vasopressin V two receptor, also known as the antidiuretic hormone receptor, AVPR two, and the renal-type arginine vasopressin receptor. It belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by vasopressin, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. It is also involved in the negative regulation of cell population proliferation, positive regulation of gene expression, and cellular responses to hormone stimuli.

Keywords: QSAR, Vasopressin V2 receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, gene expression, hormone stimuli.
