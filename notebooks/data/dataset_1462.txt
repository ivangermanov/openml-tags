This dataset is concerned with distinguishing between genuine and forged banknotes. The data was extracted from images taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. To achieve this, an industrial camera typically used for print inspection was employed. The resulting images had a high resolution of four hundred by four hundred pixels. Furthermore, due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object, grayscale pictures with a high resolution of approximately six hundred sixty dots per inch were obtained.

A wavelet transform tool was utilized to extract features from these images. This process allowed for the identification of key characteristics that could be used to differentiate between genuine and forged banknotes.

The dataset consists of four attributes, which are:

* Variance of the wavelet transformed image, a continuous value
* Skewness of the wavelet transformed image, a continuous value
* Curtosis of the wavelet transformed image, a continuous value
* Entropy of the image, a continuous value

The class attribute serves as the target variable, presumably taking on a value of one for genuine banknotes and two for forged ones.
