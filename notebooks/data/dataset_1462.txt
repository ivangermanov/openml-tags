This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred four thousand four hundred ninety-nine, and it has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and nine hundred twenty-six more molecular fingerprints. 

Scraped Data includes ID, Type, Preferred Name, Synonyms, Organism, Species Group, Protein Target Classification, and Description. 

Preferred Name is C-X-C chemokine receptor type seven, also known as ACKR three Atypical chemokine receptor three, Chemokine orphan receptor one, CMKOR one, and ten more synonyms. 

Organism is Homo sapiens, Species Group is No, and Protein Target Classification is One point Membrane receptor slash Family A G protein-coupled receptor slash Peptide receptor family A GPCR slash Chemokine receptor slash CXC chemokine receptor.
