This dataset focuses on distinguishing genuine and forged banknotes. The data were extracted from images taken of genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera typically used for print inspection was employed. The resulting images have a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object, grayscale pictures with a resolution of approximately 660 dpi were obtained. A Wavelet Transform tool was utilized to extract features from these images.

Attribute Information:
- Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
- Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
- Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
- Entropy of image (continuous)
- Class (target): Presumably genuine or forged

The dataset provides valuable information for developing and testing algorithms to authenticate banknotes based on image analysis. The use of wavelet transformation and statistical measures allows for a comprehensive examination of the banknote images, potentially revealing subtle differences between genuine and counterfeit notes.

This dataset has applications in financial security, fraud detection, and machine learning research. It offers an opportunity to explore the effectiveness of various classification algorithms in distinguishing between authentic and forged currency based on image-derived features.
