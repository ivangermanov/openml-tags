The SyskillWebert-BioMedical dataset is categorized under Machine Learning and study eighty-eight, and is sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI). This database contains the HTML source code of web pages along with their corresponding ratings from a single user. The web pages are categorized into four distinct subjects: Bands, which feature recording artists; Goats; Sheep; and Bio Medical.

The HTML source code of each web page is provided, and users were asked to rate each page on a three-point scale - hot, medium, or cold - with fifty to one hundred pages rated per domain. Although this may seem limited, it is a deliberate design choice to encourage users to rate pages, allowing us to learn user profiles from a minimal number of examples.

The primary objective is to predict user ratings for web pages within a specific subject category. The accuracy of rating predictions has been reported in earlier publications, while later studies employed metrics such as precision at top N or the F-measure.

This dataset has been utilized in various research papers, including those focusing on learning and revising user profiles, as well as identifying interesting websites.

Features include ID, text, and class.

Scraped data includes dataset information and additional information regarding the HTML source code of web pages, along with user ratings on a three-point scale.

There are no missing values in this dataset.
