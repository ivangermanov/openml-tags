The NYC Taxi Green December 2016 dataset is part of the regression on numerical features benchmark. It originated from the Trip Record Data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. This dataset comprises TLC trips of the green line during December 2016. The data was downloaded on a specific date.

For a detailed description of all variables in the dataset, refer to the TLC homepage. The variable 'tip amount' has been chosen as the target variable. Note that the variable 'total amount' is excluded by default, as it would enable deterministic prediction of the target. The date variables 'pickup datetime' and 'drop-off datetime', which are excluded by default, could be utilized to calculate supplementary time features.

In this particular version, only trips with 'payment type' equal to credit card have been selected, since tips are not typically included for most other payment methods. Additionally, the variables 'trip distance' and 'fare amount' have been removed to amplify the significance of the categorical features 'Pickup Location ID' and 'Drop-off Location ID'.

Features include Passenger Count, Tolls Amount, Pickup Datetime Day, Pickup Datetime Hour, Pickup Datetime Minute, Drop-off Datetime Day, Drop-off Datetime Hour, Drop-off Datetime Minute, and Tip Amount.
