QSAR-TID-10331 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10331. The dataset has three hundred and three rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10331. The features represent FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has three hundred and three rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, GoProcess, Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
