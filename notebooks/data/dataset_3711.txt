Past Usage:
Modeling Wine Preferences by Data Mining from Physico-Chemical Properties. In Decision Support Systems.

The dataset consists of two subsets, one for red wine and another for white wine, collected from the Portuguese Vinho Verde region. The input variables include objective tests such as pH values, while the output is based on sensory data evaluated by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between zero (very bad) and ten (excellent).

Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Various metrics were computed, including mean absolute deviation and confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance.

Relevant Information:
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. Due to privacy and logistical issues, only physico-chemical and sensory variables are available. These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. It would also be interesting to test feature selection methods.

Number of Instances: Red Wine - One Thousand Five Hundred Ninety-Nine; White Wine - Four Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety-Eight.
Number of Attributes: Eleven plus output attribute.

Input Variables:
Fixed Acidity (tartaric acid - grams per decimeter cubed)
Volatile Acidity (acetic acid - grams per decimeter cubed)
Citric Acid (grams per decimeter cubed)
Residual Sugar (grams per decimeter cubed)
Chlorides (sodium chloride - grams per decimeter cubed)
Free Sulfur Dioxide (milligrams per decimeter cubed)
Total Sulfur Dioxide (milligrams per decimeter cubed)
Density (grams per centimeter cubed)
pH
Sulphates (potassium sulphate - grams per decimeter cubed)
Alcohol (by volume)

Output Variable:
Quality (score between zero and ten)

Description of Attributes:
Fixed Acidity: Most acids involved with wine are fixed or non-volatile.
Volatile Acidity: The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at high levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegary taste.
Citric Acid: Found in small quantities, citric acid adds freshness and flavor to wines.
Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, with rare wines having less than one gram per liter and sweet wines having more than forty-five grams per liter.
Chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine.
Free Sulfur Dioxide: Prevents microbial growth and oxidation of wine.
Total Sulfur Dioxide: Amount of free and bound forms of sulfur dioxide.
Density: Depends on the percentage of alcohol and sugar content.
pH: Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from zero to fourteen.
Sulphates: Contribute to sulfur dioxide gas levels, acting as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
