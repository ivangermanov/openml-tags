QSAR-TID-10331 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10331. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset provides information about Lysosomal Pro-X Carboxypeptidase, which is a single protein and its preferred name is Lysosomal Pro-X Carboxypeptidase. Its synonyms include Angiotensinase C, Lysosomal Carboxypeptidase C, and Lysosomal Pro-X Carboxypeptidase PCP. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and its protein target classification is one point enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease SC clan/serine protease S twenty-eight family.
