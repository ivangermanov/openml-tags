QSAR-TID-10485 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurotensin Receptor One, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP features.
