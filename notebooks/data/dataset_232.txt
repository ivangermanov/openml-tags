The fishcatch dataset contains sample data on fish caught from Lake Laengelmavesi near Tampere, Finland. It comprises observations of fish species, measurements, and characteristics across multiple variables.

Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of observations on fish, including various species such as Bream, Whitewish, Roach, Pike, Perch, and others. Measurements include weight, multiple length measurements, height and width percentages, and sex of the fish.

Variables:
- Species (coded numerically, with corresponding Finnish, Swedish, English, and Latin names provided)
- Weight of the fish in grams
- Length measurements:
  - Length from nose to beginning of tail
  - Length from nose to notch of tail
  - Length from nose to end of tail
- Height as a percentage of total length
- Width as a percentage of total length
- Sex (male or female)

The data is presented with values aligned and delimited by blanks, with missing values denoted as NA. Each case is represented by one data line.

Special Notes:
Height and width can be calculated using provided percentages and length measurements.

Pedagogical Notes:
Various statistical models and tests have been applied to the data, particularly focusing on the Perch species. These include linear and non-linear models examining relationships between weight and various length, height, and width measurements. Questions of proper weighting and potential outliers are also addressed.

The dataset offers opportunities for exploring dimensional analysis of fish, heteroscedastic modeling, and outlier detection.
