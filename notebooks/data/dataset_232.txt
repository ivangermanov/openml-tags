**Fishcatch**

Tags: Life Science, Statistics

This dataset contains 159 observations of seven species of fish caught from Lake Laengelmavesi near Tampere in Finland. Each observation includes eight variables.

The descriptive abstract explains that all the fish were caught from the same lake, and altogether there are eight variables.

Variable descriptions:

1. Observation number
2. Species: A numeric code representing seven species of fish, including Bream, Whitefish, Roach, Pike, Smelt, and Perch.
3. Weight: The weight of the fish in grams.
4. Length One: The length from the nose to the beginning of the tail in centimeters.
5. Length Two: The length from the nose to the notch of the tail in centimeters.
6. Length Three: The length from the nose to the end of the tail in centimeters.
7. Height Percentage: The maximal height as a percentage of Length Three.
8. Width Percentage: The maximal width as a percentage of Length Three.

Special notes: Height and Width can be calculated by multiplying Height Percentage and Width Percentage with Length Three divided by 100.

Pedagogical notes: Models and tests have been used, particularly with Species Seven, Perch. Questions include what is the proper weighting when using Length Three as a weighting variable?
