Name: Connect Four Seed Two 

Tags: Meteorology, Transportation 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Connect Four dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of two, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. The sampling process was performed in a stratified manner.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the original dataset were identified. If there were more than ten classes, a random selection of ten classes was made based on their relative frequencies. The indices of the instances belonging to these selected classes were then retrieved.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If there were more than one hundred columns, a random selection of one hundred columns was made. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset.

Finally, the instances in the new dataset were uniformly sampled. If there were more than two thousand instances, a random selection of two thousand instances was made while maintaining the original class distribution.
