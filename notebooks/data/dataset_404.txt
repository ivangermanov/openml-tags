This dataset is one of several drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The datasets cover various aspects of drug design and molecular modeling, including melting point prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), and biodegradability prediction. They encompass a wide range of chemical compounds such as carbolenes, benzodiazepines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and protein kinase inhibitors.

The data sources include studies on neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity validation, general melting point prediction using diverse compound datasets and artificial neural networks, and the development of weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors for modeling physicochemical properties.

Several datasets focus on specific chemical classes or biological targets, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitors, anilines and phenols for toxicity and biodegradability modeling, and halogenated aliphatic compounds for acute toxicity prediction.

The datasets also include studies on structure-biodegradability relationships for chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, mechanism-based quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships for hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro- and bromo-alkenes, and quantitative structure-function and structure-stability relationships of purposely modified proteins.

Some datasets explore more specialized topics like the stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion and structure-activity relationships of antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The features in these datasets are primarily molecular descriptors, which are numerical values that characterize various aspects of molecular structure and properties. These descriptors are used to build predictive models for drug design and other chemical applications.
