Seattle Crime Dataset

This dataset belongs to the "regression on both numerical and categorical features" benchmark. It is a transformed version of the original dataset, used in the tabular data benchmark.

The original dataset represents crime reported to the Seattle Police Department. Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. This data is used for strategic planning, accountability, and performance management.

The dataset was downsampled to a smaller size. A new target feature, Reported Time, was computed. New date features were also computed, and some features were ignored. Certain features were encoded as factor variables.

The features included in this dataset are Precinct, Sector, Occurred Hour, Occurred Minute, and Reported Time.
