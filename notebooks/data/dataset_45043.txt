Original Description:

This data represents crime reported to the Seattle Police Department. Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. 

This data is the same data used in meetings such as Sea Stat for strategic planning, accountability, and performance management. For more information, see the Crime Data webpage.

For this version, the task was downsized to a smaller percentage. A new target Reported Time was computed. New date features were created, while certain features were ignored and others encoded as factor variables.

Features include Precinct, Sector, Occurred Hour, Occurred Minute, and Reported Time.
