QSAR-TID-10811 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10811. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1480 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

Rho-associated protein kinase 1 is a single protein, also known as p160ROCK, p160 ROCK-1, Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-35, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1, and Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase I. It is an enzyme, a kinase, and a protein kinase that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group, AGC protein kinase DMPK family, and AGC protein kinase ROCK subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including mitotic cytokinesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, aortic valve morphogenesis, apical constriction, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, smooth muscle contraction, organelle organization, leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and Rho protein signal transduction.

The protein is also involved in the regulation of autophagy, cardiac muscle hypertrophy, gene expression, phosphatase activity, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, cell migration, actin cytoskeleton organization, neuron projection development, and myoblast migration.

The protein has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, aspartic-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, small GTPase binding, metal ion binding, and tau protein binding.

The protein is localized in various cellular components, including the Golgi membrane, ruffle, extracellular region, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, centriole, cytosol, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and lamellipodium.
