**Data Description**
The QSAR Fish Toxicity dataset contains values for six attributes, which are molecular descriptors, of nine hundred eight chemicals used to predict quantitative acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales promelas, also known as the fathead minnow. This dataset was used to develop quantitative regression QSAR models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales promelas on a set of nine hundred eight chemicals. The LC50 data, which is the concentration that causes death in fifty percent of test fish over a test duration of ninety-six hours, was used as the model response.

**Attribute Description**
The model comprised six molecular descriptors: Molecular Properties, Information Indices, Two-Dimensional Autocorrelations, Atom-Type Counts, Atom-Type Counts, and Molecular Properties. The quantitative response, LC50, is the target feature.

**Features**
The features of this dataset include Molecular Properties, Information Indices, Two-Dimensional Autocorrelations, Atom-Type Counts, Atom-Type Counts, Molecular Properties, and LC50.
