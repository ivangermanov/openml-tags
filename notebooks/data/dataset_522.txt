Please cite: The data are a subsample of observations from a dataset that originated in a study where air pollution at a road is related to traffic volume and meteorological variables, collected by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. The response variable consists of hourly values of the logarithm of the concentration of PM10 (particles), measured at Alnabru in Oslo, Norway, between October and August. The predictor variables are the logarithm of the number of cars per hour, temperature meters above ground (degree Celsius), wind speed (meters per second), the temperature difference between and meters above ground (degree Celsius), wind direction (degrees between and), hour of day and day number from October.

The dataset contains numeric class types with no specific class index. Features include PM10 concentration, cars per hour, temperature at meters, wind speed, temperature difference between meters and meters, wind direction, hour of day, and day.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying the relationship between air pollution, traffic volume, and various meteorological factors in an urban environment. The combination of particle concentration measurements with traffic and weather data allows for comprehensive analysis of air quality dynamics in Oslo, Norway.
