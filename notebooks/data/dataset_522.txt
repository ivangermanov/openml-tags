The pm10 dataset is a subsample of five hundred observations from a larger study conducted by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, which explores the relationship between air pollution at roads and various factors such as traffic volume and meteorological conditions. The response variable consists of hourly values of the logarithm of the concentration of Particulate Matter ten micrometers or less in diameter, measured at Alnabru in Oslo, Norway, during the period between October two thousand one and August two thousand three.

The predictor variables include the logarithm of the number of cars per hour, the temperature two meters above ground level in degrees Celsius, wind speed in meters per second, the temperature difference between twenty-five meters and two meters above ground level in degrees Celsius, wind direction in degrees between zero and three sixty, hour of the day, and day number starting from October first two thousand one.

This dataset was submitted through an online platform for statistical datasets and provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between environmental factors and air quality.
