The QSAR-TID-12135 dataset is a collection of quantitative structure-activity relationship data related to the Estrogen Receptor Beta, a single protein target. This dataset consists of forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecular identifiers and class features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains activity values in units of pseudo-pCI fifty for several compounds on the drug target TID one two one three five. The Estrogen Receptor Beta is a transcription factor and nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including ovarian follicle development, behavioral fear response, and neuron migration.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset can be used for building predictive models and understanding the relationships between chemical structures and biological activities.
