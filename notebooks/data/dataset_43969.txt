The original dataset was binarized, converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive and all others as negative.

The dataset consists of various features, including those related to properties and health metrics. The binary class feature is also included.
