QSAR-TID-12345 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12345. The dataset has forty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12345. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is related to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase alpha-catalytic subunit, which is a protein target involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell growth, and differentiation. The protein is a key regulator of cellular responses to cAMP, a second messenger molecule that plays a crucial role in many physiological processes.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of inhibitors or activators of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase alpha-catalytic subunit. The dataset can be used to develop QSAR models that can predict the activity of compounds against this protein target, which can aid in the identification of potential drug candidates.
