Context 
News reports suggest that the impossible has become possible - zombies have appeared on the streets of the United States! As a result, people are panicking and wondering what they should do to stay safe. Fortunately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had foreseen this possibility and had set up a zombie preparedness website, which recommends storing essential items such as water, food, medication, tools, sanitation supplies, clothing, important documents, and first aid kits.

Thankfully, as CDC analysts, we had taken these precautions and were well-prepared for this eventuality. However, it may be too late for others who did not take these warnings seriously.

Our team has decided to identify the critical supplies that can help protect people and coordinate their distribution effectively. A few brave volunteers have offered to collect data from two hundred randomly selected adults who were alive before the zombies started roaming the streets. We already have information about these individuals, including their age, sex, household size, and whether they live in a rural, suburban, or urban area. 

Our courageous volunteers visited each of their homes and recorded their current zombie status and level of preparedness. Now, it is our task to analyze this data and determine which supplies are most closely associated with staying safe during this crisis.
