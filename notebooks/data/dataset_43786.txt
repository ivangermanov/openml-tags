Zombies Apocalypse Tags: Context

News reports suggest that the impossible has become possible - zombies have appeared on the streets of the United States! What should we do? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends storing essential items to increase chances of survival. Thankfully, as CDC analysts, we are prepared, but it may be too late for others.

Our team decides to identify the supplies that protect people and coordinate supply distribution. A few brave data collectors volunteer to check on randomly selected adults who were alive before the zombies. We have recent data on their age, sex, household size, and rural, suburban, or urban location. Our heroic volunteers visit each home and record the zombie status and preparedness.

Now it's our job to figure out which supplies are associated with safety. We have data on the availability of water, food, medication, tools, first aid supplies, sanitation items, clothing, and essential documents. We need to analyze this data to determine which supplies are crucial for survival.
