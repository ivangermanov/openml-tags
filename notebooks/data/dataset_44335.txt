**Meta Album Fungi Dataset (Extended)**

The Meta Album Fungi dataset is created by sampling the Danish Fungi dataset, itself a sampling of the Atlas of Danish Fungi repository. The images and labels which enter this database are sourced by a group consisting of citizen botanists, then verified by their peers using a ranking of each person's reliability, and finally verified by experts working at the Atlas.

Of the classes in the original Danish Fungi dataset, the Meta Album Fungi dataset retains the most populous classes, belonging to six genera, for a total of images. Each image contains a colored image of a fungus or a piece of a fungus from the corresponding class. Because the initial data were of widely varying sizes, a significant portion of the images needed to be cropped, which was implemented by taking the largest possible square with center at the middle of the initial image. The squared images were then scaled to the standard using the INTER_AREA anti-aliasing filter from Open-CV.
