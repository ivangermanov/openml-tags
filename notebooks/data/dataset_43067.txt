This is an experimental dataset for trying to classify numbers in a lottery as "Highly Likely to be Picked" or "Not Very Likely to be Picked". It is based on a little more than a year's worth of actual daily drawing results from the Florida Fantasy Five, with derivative elements such as the count of times picked, average times picked, days since last picked, and so on.

The dataset includes features such as the count of times a number has been picked, the number of days since it was last picked, the average number of days since it was last picked, the mean and median of the count of times picked, the variance and standard deviation of the count of times picked, and the difference between the mean and median of the count of times picked.

Additionally, the dataset includes features related to the days since last picked, such as the mean and median of the days since last picked, the variance and standard deviation of the days since last picked, and the difference between the mean and median of the days since last picked.

The dataset also includes features related to the percentage of times a number has been picked, such as the percentage of times picked, the average percentage of times picked, the mean and median of the percentage of times picked, the variance and standard deviation of the percentage of times picked, and the difference between the mean and median of the percentage of times picked.

The goal of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive set of features that can be used to classify numbers in a lottery as "Highly Likely to be Picked" or "Not Very Likely to be Picked".
