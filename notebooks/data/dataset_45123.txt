**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Three.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and development. The Barley Bayesian Network is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides".

The network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters exceeding one hundred fourteen thousand. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree of the network is four.

This Bayesian network is a complex model that represents the relationships between various factors affecting the production of barley. It is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on projects related to agriculture, ecology, and environmental science.

The network features a range of variables, including those related to soil type, nitrogen levels, protein content, and pest control methods. These variables are interconnected, allowing for the analysis of complex relationships and dependencies between them.
