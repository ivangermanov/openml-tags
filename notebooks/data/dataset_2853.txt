This dataset is similar to the CIFAR ten, except it has one hundred classes containing six hundred images each. There are five hundred training images and one hundred testing images per class. The one hundred classes in the CIFAR one hundred are grouped into twenty superclasses. Each image comes with a fine label, which is the class to which it belongs, and a coarse label, which is the superclass to which it belongs.

The CIFAR one hundred dataset is a comprehensive collection of images, divided into twenty supercategories, with six hundred images in each of its one hundred classes. It provides a fine-grained classification challenge, where each image has both a fine label indicating its specific class and a coarse label indicating its broader superclass.
