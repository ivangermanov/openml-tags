The Diamonds dataset is a classic collection of data that contains the prices and other attributes of a large number of diamonds. It is an excellent dataset for beginners learning to work with data analysis and visualization. 

This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. The dataset has been transformed in the same way as the dataset used in the tabular data benchmark.

The dataset contains the following attributes: price, which is the price of the diamond in US dollars; carat, which is the weight of the diamond; cut, which is the quality of the cut of the diamond, ranging from Fair to Ideal; color, which is the color of the diamond, ranging from J, the worst, to D, the best; clarity, which is a measurement of how clear the diamond is, ranging from I1, the worst, to IF, the best; x, y, and z, which are the length, width, and depth of the diamond in millimeters, respectively; and depth percentage, which is the total depth percentage of the diamond, calculated as the depth divided by the mean of the length and width. 

The dataset also contains the table, which is the width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.

The features of this dataset include carat, depth, table, x, y, and z, as well as price.
