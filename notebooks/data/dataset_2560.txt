The Energy Building dataset is a multivariate regression data set that focuses on predicting the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings, which is essential for achieving energy efficiency. This task is accomplished by analyzing various building parameters, including the relative compactness of the building, its overall height, roof area, and glazing area, among other factors. 

Keywords: Energy Building dataset, multivariate regression, energy efficiency, building parameters, heating load, cooling load.
