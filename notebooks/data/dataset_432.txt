The Friedman Datasets 

These eighty artificially generated datasets originate from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Fri Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

This Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: y equals ten times sine of pi x one x two plus twenty times x three minus point five squared equals ten times X four plus five times X five plus e. 

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 

These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 

The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: 

The number of features varies; only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples also varies. 

Colinearity degrees vary as well. 

For the datasets with high colinearity degree, the number of features is generated accordingly; otherwise, the number of features is generated differently. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
