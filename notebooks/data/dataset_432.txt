This dataset, named Stevenson, is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset is derived from various original studies on topics including carbolenes, melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro and bromoalkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, protein engineering, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The studies employed various methodologies including artificial neural networks, molecular modeling, weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors, linear and non-linear models, regression analyses, multivariate pattern recognition, and quantitative structure-property/function/stability relationships.

The research spans multiple areas of medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and drug design, focusing on predicting and understanding molecular properties, biological activities, and structure-function relationships.
