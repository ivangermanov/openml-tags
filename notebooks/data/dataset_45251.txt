Pathfinder Bayesian Network. Sample Ten.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this network as a discrete very large model.

This network consists of one hundred nine nodes and one hundred ninety-five arcs, resulting in seventy-two thousand seventy-nine parameters. On average, each node has a Markov blanket size of approximately three point eight two and an average degree of three point five eight. The maximum in-degree for any node is five.

This model is particularly useful in manufacturing and fault diagnosis applications due to its ability to represent complex relationships between variables.

The Pathfinder project was designed to create normative expert systems, which are capable of reasoning about uncertainty and making decisions based on incomplete information.
