Pathfinder Bayesian Network. Sample Ten.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online. This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are moderate, indicating a relatively sparse network. The maximum in-degree is relatively low, suggesting that most nodes have a limited number of parents.

The Pathfinder Project is a normative expert system that aims to provide a framework for decision-making under uncertainty. This Bayesian network is part of the project and represents a large and complex system.

The network features a range of variables, including Fault, and many others.
