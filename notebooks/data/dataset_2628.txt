This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex USD/DKK from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day, with no weekend data included since Forex markets are not traded on weekends. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The dataset spans a specific period, providing a comprehensive overview of market trends and patterns. The class attribute is defined as the direction of the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the following day, relative to the mean high bid and high ask prices of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is expected to increase the following day, and false when the mean high price is expected to decrease or remain stable.

Please note that this task is purely hypothetical and intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of close attributes, which are also available.
