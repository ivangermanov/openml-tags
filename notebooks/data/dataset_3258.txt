This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target QSAR-TID-10628, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule Chembl ID and Median Pxc Fifty.

The features represent Folded Chemical Fingerprint 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from Smiles strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule Chembl ID, and multiple folded chemical fingerprint features. This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR project, drug target, Chembl ID.
