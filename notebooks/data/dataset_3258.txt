QSAR-TID-10628 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10628. The dataset has thirty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The MetaQSAR project, which was conducted in September two thousand fifteen, is the source of this dataset. This dataset should be cited when used.
