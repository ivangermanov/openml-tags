Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Two.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this dataset, which is a preliminary model for barley developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". 

This network has forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, resulting in one hundred fourteen thousand five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, while the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Barley Bayesian Network was designed to explore the relationships between various factors affecting barley production, including agronomic traits, environmental factors, and management practices. 

Features include traits such as Thousand Kernel Volume, Thousand Kernel Weight, Protein Content, and Sort Size, among others.
