**Meta Album Boats Dataset (Micro)**

The original version of the Meta Album boats dataset is called the Marvel dataset, which can be found on GitHub. It has a large collection of images of twenty-six different maritime vessels in their natural background. Each class has a varying number of images, and the images are of variable resolutions. To preprocess this dataset, we either duplicate the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right most three columns based on the orientation of the original image to create square images. No cropping was applied because the boats occupy most of the image, and applying this technique would lead to incomplete images. Finally, the square images were resized into a uniform size using an anti-aliasing filter.
