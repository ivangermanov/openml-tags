Name: Numerai Dataset Subsample

Tags: Subsampling of the Numerai dataset with seed equals one, two thousand rows, one hundred columns, ten classes, and stratification enabled.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using uniform random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns from the filtered data if the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum. It sorts the selected column indices to maintain the original order.

If the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum, the function uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows. This ensures that the sampled data maintains the original distribution of classes.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string format and returns the subsampled dataset.
