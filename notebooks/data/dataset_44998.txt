**Data Description**
The Airlines_DepDelay_1M dataset contains information about departure delays of airlines from the years 1987 to 2013. This is a subset of the 10M version, which is once again a subset of the original dataset. The unique carrier is the airline, and a list of these carriers can be found at https://aspm.faa.gov/aspmhelp/index/ASQP__Carrier_Codes_and_Names.html. Preprocessing on time features of the data has been performed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset consists of several attributes that provide insight into the departure delays of airlines. The target feature, Departure Delay, represents how long the delay was. The Month attribute indicates the month of the year, while the Day of the Month attribute ranges from 1 to 31. The Day of the Week attribute represents the day of the week, with Monday being 1 and Sunday being 7. The Unique Carrier attribute is a unique code assigned to each airline. The Origin and Destination attributes represent the origin and destination airport codes, respectively. The Distance attribute represents the distance between the airports in miles. The Scheduled Departure Time and Scheduled Arrival Time attributes are broken down into hour and minute components, providing a detailed understanding of the flight schedule.
