GAMETES Heterogeneity Dataset 

Tags: Artificial Intelligence, Health, Medicine 

This dataset explores gametes heterogeneity with twenty attributes. The heterogeneity level is set at point four, with a variation of point two over fifty samples. It utilizes an Evolutionary Distance Metric approach, specifically EDM-two.

Features include various numerical values, such as Node Zero, Node One, Node Two, and so on up to Node Fifteen. Additionally, there are features related to markers, namely Marker Zero Parent Zero, Marker Zero Parent One, Marker One Parent Zero, and Marker One Parent One. The dataset also includes a classification category.
