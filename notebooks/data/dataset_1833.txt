This dataset, QSAR-TID-103437, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103437. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including identifiers and class features.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was sourced in September 2015. It should be cited when used.

The target protein is STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase, also known as DCHT, Serine/threonine-protein kinase 39, SPAK, and Ste-20-related kinase. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE20 family/STE protein kinase FRAY subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including response to dietary excess, protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and regulation of blood pressure. It is also associated with cellular components such as nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, and cell cortex.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, protein kinase, STE20, MetaQSAR, biological processes, cellular components.
