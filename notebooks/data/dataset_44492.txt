Machine Learning Dataset: Wilt Seed Four Rows Two Thousand NC Classes Ten NC Columns One Hundred Stratify True

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Wilt dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed ten. Additionally, the number of columns was limited to one hundred, and the number of rows was capped at two thousand.

The stratification parameter was set to true, which means that the sampling was done in a way that preserved the proportion of each class in the original dataset. This is particularly important when working with imbalanced datasets, as it helps maintain the integrity of the underlying relationships between variables.

The resulting dataset consists of a selection of features, including mean values for green, red, and near-infrared bands, as well as standard deviation values for the planar band. These features were carefully chosen to represent the most informative aspects of the original dataset.
