Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses a random number generator to select a specified number of rows, columns, and classes from the original dataset. The function first selects the classes to keep, then selects the indices where one of these classes is present, and finally selects the columns to keep. If the number of rows in the resulting dataset is still greater than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the final set of rows.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratified sampling. It returns a new dataset with the selected rows, columns, and classes.

Features: Mean of Green, Mean of Red, Mean of Near Infrared, Standard Deviation of Plan, and Class.
