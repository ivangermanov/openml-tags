QSAR-TID-17074 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17074. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17074. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate molecular fingerprints, which are a way to represent molecular structures as a series of bits.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery.

The dataset contains information about the Histamine H1 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as H1R, HH1R, and HRH1. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of vascular permeability.
