Machine Learning, Multi-Task QSAR 

The QSAR-TID-17074 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17074. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including identifiers and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17074.

The dataset is composed of multiple identifiers, including molecule ChEMBL ID, and a class feature, median pXC fifty. The molecular fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

This dataset is suitable for machine learning and multi-task QSAR applications, particularly those focused on drug target TID: 17074.
