Emotions Sensor Data Set 

Tags: Demographics, Health Context 

Emotions detection is an interesting blend of psychology and technology. This technology helps to build companion robots, which can be friendly and have the ability to recognize users' emotions and needs, and to act accordingly. It's essentially a way to determine how your consumers are reacting to your website, social media posts, and other forms of your online content. This helps to transform the face of marketing and advertising by reading human emotions and then adapting consumer experiences to these emotions in real-time.

What is Emotions Sensor Dataset?
The Emotions Sensor Data Set contains top English words classified statistically using the Naive Bayes algorithm into seven basic emotions: disgust, surprise, neutral, anger, sadness, happiness, and fear.

How was this dataset built?
First, we collected thousands of sentences, blogs, and tweets, totaling approximately one million words. We labeled these sentences manually and automatically into seven basic emotions: disgust, surprise, neutral, anger, sadness, happiness, and fear. Now, we chose the top most used English words. Word by word, we calculated the probabilities of existence of these words in disgust, surprise, neutral, anger, sadness, happiness, and fear sentences and put them in a simple CSV file. We used the Naive Bayes algorithm to calculate these probabilities of existence of these words.

Where to use this dataset?
The Emotions Sensor Data Set helps to detect emotions in text or voice speech, and you can easily build a sentiment analysis bot in a few simple steps.
