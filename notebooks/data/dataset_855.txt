Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, likely used for various studies and mythbusting purposes. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification task, where instances are labeled as either positive or negative based on their relation to the mean value. This conversion allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem, potentially offering new insights or comparisons between regression and classification approaches. The dataset includes multiple features, labeled as 'oz' followed by a number, suggesting they may represent different measurements or characteristics related to the problem at hand. The final feature, 'binary Class', likely represents the transformed target variable used for classification.
