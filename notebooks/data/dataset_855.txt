The Confidence dataset has been modified to create a binarized version of the original data set. This modification involves converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the majority class has been relabeled as Positive and all other classes have been relabeled as Negative. 

Features included in this dataset include Positive, Negative, and Oxygen.
