This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset consists of various features including oz one through oz ten and a binary class feature. This classification enables a more straightforward analysis and comparison of the data instances. The resulting binary classes provide a clear distinction between the two groups, facilitating further investigation and modeling of the underlying relationships.
