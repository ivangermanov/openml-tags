This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101053, is categorized under Computer Systems, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR. It originates from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101053. There are eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

The dataset provides information about the serine/threonine-protein kinase MRCK beta, also known as CDC forty-two binding protein kinase beta, CDC forty-two BPB, CDC forty-two BP-beta, DMPK-like beta, and MRCK beta. This enzyme belongs to the AGC protein kinase group, AGC protein kinase DMPK family, and AGC protein kinase GEK subfamily. 

Organism-wise, this enzyme is associated with Homo sapiens. The dataset includes information about the expression atlas, component, function, process, and interaction of this enzyme. It also provides links to various databases, including Expression Atlas, Go Component, Go Function, Go Process, canSAR-Target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro.
