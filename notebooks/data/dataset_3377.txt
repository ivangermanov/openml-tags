QSAR-TID-101585 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101585. The dataset has fifty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101585. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Glucagon-like peptide one receptor, which is a single protein target.

The Glucagon-like peptide one receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family B G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

The receptor is also involved in various diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. It is a potential drug target for the treatment of these diseases.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Glucagon-like peptide one receptor.
