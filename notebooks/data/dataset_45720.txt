The Three Dimensional Location Estimation Using Received Signal Strength Indication of Wireless Local Area Network dataset aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning-based localization algorithm that can accurately estimate the position of a receiver based on Received Signal Strength Indication information from surrounding radio transmitters, including height information, enabling the estimation of the target's three-dimensional location.

Features: Index, Unix Time, Service Set Identifier, Frequency, Channel, Received Signal Strength Indication, Access Point Latitude, Access Point Longitude, Latitude, Longitude, Receiver Height, Split.

Keywords: Three Dimensional Location Estimation, Received Signal Strength Indication, Wireless Local Area Network, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Localization Algorithm, Radio Transmitters, Height Information.
