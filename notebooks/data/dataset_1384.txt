This dataset, known as BNG (Letter), is an artificial dataset with the tag BNG. It contains various features related to geometric and spatial characteristics of letters. These features include measurements of bounding boxes (Xbox and Ybox), dimensional attributes (width and height), pixel density (on pixels), and various bar-related metrics (X Bar, Y Bar, X Second Bar, Y Second Bar, XY Bar). Additionally, it incorporates more complex features such as X Squared Y Bar and XY Squared Bar. The dataset also considers edge-related attributes, including X Edge, Y Edge, and their relationships with opposing axes (X Edge Versus Y and Y Edge Versus X). Finally, it includes a class feature, likely for categorization purposes.
