This is a smaller version of the original dataset, containing one million rows. The dataset is tagged with economics and geography.

The Higgs dataset was sourced from the University of California Irvine and is available on the UCI website. 

The dataset is comprised of Higgs boson detection data produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. These features include lepton momentum, lepton angle, missing energy magnitude, and various jet properties. The last seven features are high-level features derived by physicists to help differentiate between signal and background classes. 

There is a growing interest in utilizing deep learning methods to eliminate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. The last five hundred thousand examples are reserved as a test set.

Attribute information includes the class label, where one denotes signal and zero denotes background. Twenty-one low-level features include various kinematic properties, while seven high-level features are derived by physicists to aid in classification.
