The QSAR-TID-11403 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma. This dataset has twenty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecular identifiers and a class feature representing the median pseudo-pCI50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.

The Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma is a single protein that belongs to the nuclear receptor subfamily one group B member three protein family. It is primarily involved in regulating gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in the formation of limbs, eyes, and glands.

This protein plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including apoptosis, cell differentiation, and tissue development. It also responds to retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, which is essential for normal embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.
