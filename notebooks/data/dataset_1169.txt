The Airlines dataset is inspired by a regression dataset and its primary objective is to predict whether a given flight will experience delays, based on the scheduled departure information. This dataset encompasses various features that provide insight into the flights, including the airline operating the flight, the specific flight number, the airport of origin and destination, the day of the week, the time of departure, and the length of the flight.
