Please cite: Airlines Dataset inspired by the regression dataset. The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.

This dataset focuses on predicting flight delays based on scheduled departure information. It was created for a data competition and draws inspiration from an existing regression dataset. The primary objective is to determine if a particular flight will experience a delay using various factors related to the scheduled departure.

The dataset includes several features that can be used for analysis and prediction:

- Airline
- Flight
- Airport of Origin
- Destination Airport
- Day of the Week
- Time
- Flight Duration
- Delay Status

These features provide a comprehensive view of each flight, allowing researchers and data scientists to develop models for predicting delays in air travel. The dataset's focus on concept drift makes it particularly valuable for studying how prediction models perform over time as patterns in flight delays may change.
