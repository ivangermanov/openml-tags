The QSAR-TID-10616 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10616. This dataset has 249 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The Prostanoid EP four receptor is a single protein and the preferred name for this target. It also has synonyms such as PGE two receptor EP four subtype, PGE receptor EP four subtype, and Prostaglandin E two receptor EP four subtype.

This receptor is classified under one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and Prostanoid receptor.

It is expressed in Mus musculus species group, and its protein target classification is one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and Prostanoid receptor.

This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of cytokine production, positive regulation of cytokine production, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of peptide secretion, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, JNK cascade, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, response to mechanical stimulus, response to nematode, positive regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of hydrogen peroxide metabolic process, regulation of circadian sleep/wake cycle, wakefulness, and many others.

Keywords: QSAR, Prostanoid EP4 receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, inflammatory response, immune response.
