QSAR-TID-10616 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10616. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The Prostanoid EP4 receptor, also known as the PGE2 receptor EP4 subtype, is a single protein target that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, immune response, and signal transduction.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the plasma membrane, membrane, nuclear membrane, neuronal cell body, and neuron projection terminus. It plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cytokine production, protein phosphorylation, and cell population proliferation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to study the structure-activity relationships of compounds against the Prostanoid EP4 receptor. It can be used to develop predictive models for identifying potential drug candidates and to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the receptor's function.
