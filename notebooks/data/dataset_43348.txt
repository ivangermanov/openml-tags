Car Review Dataset

Tags: Context

This dataset was created for a final year project and further improved upon during quarantine. It contains a mix of used and new car reviews from various brands, ranging from the year two thousand to two thousand nineteen, sourced from Edmunds.com. The dataset focuses on popular brands in the United States, rather than attempting to include all brands.

A walkthrough notebook is also included to provide a comprehensive guide.

The inspiration behind creating this dataset was the lack of a proper car review dataset for the final year project, which led to the creation of this comprehensive collection.

The dataset features include the company, model, year, reviewer, date, title, rating, and review.
