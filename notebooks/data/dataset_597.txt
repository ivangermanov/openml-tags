The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded according to their specific characteristics, including colinearity degree and sample number. 

These datasets were created using the Friedman function, which includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, with a normalized noise added to the output. 

This function is particularly useful because it allows researchers to generate datasets with specific properties, such as the ability to test the effects of nonrelated features or to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity.

The Friedman function itself is complex, incorporating multiple variables and mathematical operations. It generates datasets with five features for input, which can then be expanded to include additional features that are independent from the output.

To create these datasets, various parameters were manipulated, including the number of features, the number of samples, and the colinearity degree. 

The number of features varied from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are actually related to the output. The remaining features are randomly generated.

Similarly, the number of samples ranged from one hundred to one thousand. 

The colinearity degree, which measures the number of features dependent on other features, ranged from zero to four.

By varying these parameters, eighty unique datasets were generated, each with its own distinct characteristics.
