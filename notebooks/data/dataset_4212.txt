Membership Woes 

A premium club boasting a large customer membership base faces a significant challenge. Members pay an annual membership fee to utilize the club's exclusive facilities, with fees tailored to each individual's personalized package. However, over the past few years, the club has struggled with a substantial number of members canceling their memberships.

To tackle this issue, the club management aims to proactively address customer grievances. Unfortunately, they lack the resources to personally reach out to their entire customer base. Therefore, they seek to employ a statistical approach to identify customers at risk of canceling their memberships.

The goal is to develop a system that helps the club identify these high-risk customers. To achieve this, the following features will be analyzed: membership number, membership term years, annual fees, marital status, gender, annual income, occupation code, membership package, age at membership issuance, additional members, payment mode, agent code, membership status, start date, and end date.
