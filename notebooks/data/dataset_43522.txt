This is a Multipurpose World News Dataset, tagged as Content. I started building this dataset for my future personal projects, as I believe this kind of data is quite hard to acquire for free and in a short amount of time. I began acquiring data on a specific date and intend to keep doing so constantly. 

What you will find inside this dataset are news articles extracted from the following reputable sources: Fox Business, YouTube, CNET, The Verge, The New York Times, Raw Story, Investors, WREG, Reuters, KOIN, Inc, CNBC, NJ, WMTW, NBC DFW, Bloomberg, WOWT, and BBC. 

For every twenty-minute interval, a script checks for new headlines on these sources and adds them into a database. This CSV file is generated from that database. I intend to update this dataset daily, if possible, and if the machine I run this script on is operational.

The dataset features include a unique identifier, a timestamp, the source of the news article, the title of the article, and a brief description of the article.

Keywords: news dataset, personal projects, data acquisition, news sources, database, CSV file.
