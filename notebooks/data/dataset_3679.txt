QSAR-TID-101317 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Statistics, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101317, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this source when using the dataset.

The data shows activity values of various compounds on a specific drug target. The features are molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes multiple features such as molecule IDs, molecular fingerprints, and other relevant information. The molecular fingerprints are represented as binary vectors.

The dataset is useful for machine learning and statistical modeling applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features for training and testing models.

The target protein is known as MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase four, which is a single protein. It has multiple synonyms including KIAA eighteen sixty, MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase four, MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-like one, MARK four, and MARKL one.

The protein is classified under the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK one family/CAMK protein kinase MARK subfamily category.

It is expressed in Homo sapiens species and has multiple functions including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, microtubule binding, cytoskeletal anchor activity, kinase activity, transferase activity, gamma-tubulin binding, ubiquitin binding, and tau protein binding.
