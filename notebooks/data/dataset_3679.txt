Avocado Prices Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Context:
It is a well-known fact that Millennials love Avocado Toast. It is also a well-known fact that many Millennials live in their parents' basements. Clearly, they are not buying homes because they are spending too much money on Avocado Toast! But maybe there is hope; if a Millennial could find a city with affordable avocados, they could live out the Millennial American Dream.

Content:
This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of two thousand eighteen, compiled into a single CSV file. According to the Hass Avocado Board, the data represents weekly retail scan data for national retail volume and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers' cash registers, based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in two thousand thirteen, the data reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery stores, mass merchandisers, clubs, drugstores, dollar stores, and military bases. The Average Price in the data reflects a per-unit cost, even when multiple units are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes in the data are only for Hass avocados; other varieties of avocados, such as Greenskin avocados, are not included.

Some relevant columns in the dataset include:

* Date: The date of the observation
* Average Price: The average price of a single avocado
* Type: Conventional or Organic
* Year: The year of the observation
* Region: The city or region of the observation
* Total Volume: The total number of avocados sold
* Total Bags: The total number of bags sold
* Small Bags: The total number of small bags sold
* Large Bags: The total number of large bags sold
* X-Large Bags: The total number of extra-large bags sold
