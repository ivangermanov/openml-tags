Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma dataset, also known as Lymphoma 3 classes or DLBCL, is a microarray dataset that identifies distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through gene expression profiling. This dataset is characterized by its ability to distinguish between different subtypes of lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system.

The dataset features a wide range of genes, including those involved in cell signaling, metabolism, and gene regulation. These genes are crucial in understanding the underlying mechanisms of lymphoma and its various subtypes.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for lymphoma patients. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of different lymphoma subtypes, researchers can identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

The dataset has been widely cited and has contributed significantly to our understanding of lymphoma biology and its clinical implications.
