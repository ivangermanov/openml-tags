The Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma dataset is a collection of data related to a type of cancer known as Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma. This dataset is classified under three categories, namely Lymphoma Three Classes or DLBCL for short. 

This dataset has been obtained through a study published in a scientific journal called Nature. The study was focused on identifying distinct types of diffuse large B cell lymphoma by analyzing gene expression profiles.

The dataset consists of numerous features, including genes that have been identified through microarray analysis. 

Machine learning algorithms can be applied to this dataset to identify patterns and correlations between different genes and their expressions.

Social media platforms can also be used to share information about this dataset and facilitate collaboration among researchers working on similar projects.
