Cover Type Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Mathematics 

This dataset is part of the Tabular Data Benchmark and has been transformed accordingly. It falls under the classification on numerical features category.

The dataset originates from the LibSVM repository, where it can be found under the name covtype.binary. 

For proper citation, please reference the original work: A Parallel Mixture of SVMs for Very Large Scale Problems by authors, published in Neural Computation.

To create this dataset, the following steps were taken:

Load the Cover Type dataset without scaling. 
Normalize each column according to specific rules:
    Constant features with only one value were set to zero and removed due to sparsity.
    Binary features with two values had their most frequent value set to zero, and the other to one.
    Multinary or real features with more than two values were divided by their standard deviation.
Duplicate lines were removed to ensure data integrity.

The dataset underwent transformation from multiclass to binary class. 

Features include various numerical columns.
