This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Neurokinin Two Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides information about the Neurokinin Two Receptor, a single protein preferred name, also known as Neurokinin A receptor, NK Two R, NK-Two receptor, and NKNAR.

Organism for this protein is Homo sapiens, species group is No, and protein target classification is One point Membrane receptor Family A G protein-coupled receptor Peptide receptor family A GPCR Short peptide receptor family A GPCR Neurokinin receptor.
