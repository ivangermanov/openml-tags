QSAR-TID-10184 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10184. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The Neurokinin 2 receptor, also known as the Neurokinin A receptor, is a single protein target that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is involved in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, signal transduction, and smooth muscle contraction.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the intestine, uterus, and sperm, and plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including acetylcholine secretion, vascular permeability, and uterine smooth muscle contraction.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Neurokinin 2 receptor.
