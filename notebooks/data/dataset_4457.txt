Australian Seed Two Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Cols One Hundred Stratify True 

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Australian dataset with forty thousand nine hundred eighty-one entries. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of two, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. The stratification argument was set to true.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the dataset were identified, and then a random selection of classes was made based on their frequency distribution. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were used to filter the dataset.

Next, a uniform sampling of columns was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. This was done by randomly selecting column indices without replacement.

Finally, the dataset was further reduced by uniformly sampling rows while maintaining the class distribution. This was achieved through stratified splitting of the dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the reduced feature set with corresponding class labels. The categorical mask has been preserved to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
