Name: GNFUV Pi Two
Tags: Computational Universe, Images Test

Dataset Information:

The dataset consists of four sets of mobile sensor readings data, including humidity and temperature values, collected from a swarm of four Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Each USV set contains records in the following format: USV Identification, Humidity Value, Temperature Value, Experiment Identification, and Sensing Time.

The swarm of USVs moves along a predefined GPS trajectory, with relative waypoints specified in the accompanying README document. The USVs float on the surface of the sea in a coastal area of Athens, Greece.

Scraped Data:

This dataset does not contain any missing values.

Additional Variable Information:

Attributes include:
Device, which represents the USV Identification as a string;
Humidity, which represents the sensed humidity value from the USV sensor as a real value;
Temperature, which represents the sensed temperature value from the USV sensor as a real value;
Experiment, which represents a constant real value; and
Time, which represents the sensing and reporting time as a real value.
