Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository and can be found under the discrete-large category.

The Hepar2 network consists of seventy nodes connected by one hundred twenty-three arcs, resulting in one thousand four hundred fifty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, while the average degree is three point five one. The maximum in-degree is six.

This network represents a probabilistic causal model in medicine, specifically applied to the diagnosis of liver disorders. It encompasses various symptoms, test results, and risk factors related to liver health.

Some of the notable features of this network include anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase readings, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint issues, platelet count, VH AMN readings, spider naevi, spleen health, age, jaundice, HBsAg antibody presence, chronic hepatitis, itching, steatosis, sex, history of injections, HBsAg presence, cirrhosis, palmar symptoms, pain, HCV antibody presence, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase readings, rheumatic hepatitis, gallstone presence, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase readings, primary biliary cirrhosis, alanine transaminase readings, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, aspartate transaminase readings, HBeAg presence, skin issues, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, HBC antibody presence, right upper quadrant pressure, history of alcohol consumption, LE cells presence, AMA readings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites, hospitalization history, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, density readings, transfusion history, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, edge readings, edema, fatty tissue, and history of alcoholism and surgery.
