QSAR-TID-100948 Dataset Description

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand nine hundred forty-eight, and it has one hundred thirty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, and median pxc fifty.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen.

Proto-oncogene Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Mer is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Mer, Mertk, Proto-oncogene c-Mer, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Mertk, and Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Mer. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/Tyrosine protein kinase Axle family member found in Homo sapiens.
