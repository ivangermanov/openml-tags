**Energy Efficiency Dataset**

**Source**

The dataset was created and processed by researchers at the Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK.

**Data Set Information**

We perform energy analysis using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the aforementioned characteristics to obtain a large number of building shapes. The dataset comprises a large number of samples and eight features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

**Attribute Information**

The dataset contains eight attributes, or features, and two responses, or outcomes. The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. Specifically, the features are related to the physical characteristics of the buildings, such as their shape, size, and orientation, as well as the distribution of glazing areas. The responses are related to the energy performance of the buildings, including heating and cooling loads.

**Relevant Papers**

The dataset is based on research published in the journal Energy and Buildings, which presents a methodology for accurate quantitative estimation of energy performance of residential buildings using statistical machine learning tools.

**Features**

The dataset includes features such as relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. The responses are heating load and cooling load.

**Scraped Data**

The dataset information provides additional details on the data analysis methodology.

**Additional Information**

The dataset is suitable for energy analysis and can be used to predict energy performance of residential buildings.

**Has Missing Values?**

No, the dataset does not have missing values.

**Additional Variable Information**

The dataset contains eight attributes, or features, and two responses, or outcomes. The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses.
