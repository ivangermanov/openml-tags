Avocado Prices

Context
It is a well-known fact that Millennials love Avocado Toast. It's also a well-known fact that all Millennials live in their parents' basements. Clearly, they aren't buying homes because they are buying too much Avocado Toast! But maybe there's hope if a Millennial could find a city with cheap avocados, they could live out the Millennial American Dream of owning a home and enjoying their favorite breakfast.

This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of last year, compiled into a single CSV file. The Hass Avocado Board describes the data on their website as weekly retail scan data for national retail volume and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers' cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in two thousand thirteen, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar, and military. The Average Price in the table reflects a per unit cost, even when multiple units are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados, such as greenskins, are not included in this table.

Some relevant columns in the dataset include the Date of the observation, Average Price of a single avocado, type of avocado, whether it's conventional or organic, year of the observation, Region of the observation, Total Volume of avocados sold, and the Total Number of avocados with specific Product Lookup codes sold.
