House Sixteen H Tags: Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "Classification on Numerical Features" benchmark. 

Original description: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive and all others as negative. 

The dataset features include various parameters. The classification target is a binary class.
