This dataset was used in the tabular data benchmark and was transformed in the same manner. It belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

The original dataset has been modified to create a binarized version. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'.

The dataset consists of several features, including certain physical properties.

Binary Class is a key aspect of this dataset.
