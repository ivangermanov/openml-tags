Heart Disease Patients

There are many industries where understanding how things group together is beneficial. For instance, retailers want to understand the similarities among their customers to direct targeted advertisement campaigns, and botanists classify plants based on their shared similar characteristics. One way to group objects is to use clustering algorithms, which can help identify patterns and relationships within a dataset. 

We are going to explore the usefulness of unsupervised clustering algorithms to help doctors understand which treatments might work with their patients. By clustering anonymized data of patients who have been diagnosed with heart disease, we can identify patients with similar characteristics who might respond to the same treatments. This information can be invaluable to doctors, as they could benefit from learning about the treatment outcomes of patients similar to those they are treating.

The data we are analyzing comes from the VA Medical Center in Long Beach, California. Before running any analysis, it is essential to get an idea of what the data looks like. The clustering algorithms we will use require numeric data, so we will check that all the data are numeric.

The dataset features include patient information such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar levels, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, and old peak.
