There are many industries where understanding how things group together is beneficial. For instance, retailers want to comprehend the similarities among their customers in order to direct targeted advertisement campaigns effectively. Similarly, botanists categorize plants based on their shared comparable characteristics. One effective way to group objects is to utilize clustering algorithms.

We are going to explore the usefulness of unsupervised clustering algorithms to assist doctors in understanding which treatments might be effective for their patients. In particular, we will be clustering anonymized data of patients who have been diagnosed with heart disease. It is likely that patients with similar characteristics might respond positively to the same treatments, and doctors could greatly benefit from learning about the treatment outcomes of patients similar to those they are currently treating.

The data we are analyzing originates from the VA Medical Center in Long Beach, California. It is essential to gain an understanding of what the data looks like before running any analysis. The clustering algorithms we will employ require numeric data; therefore, we will verify that all the data are indeed numeric.

Features:
Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level, Fasting Blood Sugar Level, Resting Electrocardiogram Results, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise Induced Angina, Old Peak Measurement, Slope of the Peak Exercise Segment
