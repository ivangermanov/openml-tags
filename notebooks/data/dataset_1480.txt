This dataset contains liver patient records and non-liver patient records collected from the north east region of Andhra Pradesh, India. The class label categorizes patients into two groups: liver patients and non-liver patients. The dataset comprises male and female patient records, with a significant majority being male patients.

Attribute Information:
- Age of the patient (any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90")
- Gender of the patient
- Total Bilirubin
- Direct Bilirubin
- Alkaline Phosphatase (Alkphos)
- Alanine Aminotransferase (Sgpt)
- Aspartate Aminotransferase (Sgot)
- Total Proteins
- Albumin
- Albumin and Globulin Ratio (A/G Ratio)

A feature indicating a train-test split has been removed from the original dataset.

- A Critical Study of Selected Classification Algorithms for Liver Disease Diagnosis, published in the International Journal of Database Management Systems.

This dataset is valuable for researchers and medical professionals studying liver diseases and developing diagnostic tools. It provides a comprehensive set of medical attributes that can be used to analyze and predict liver patient status. The inclusion of both liver and non-liver patient records allows for comparative studies and the development of classification models for liver disease diagnosis.
