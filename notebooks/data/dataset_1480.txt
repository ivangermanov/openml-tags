This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It has multiple applications in machine learning and computational universe studies, particularly in multi-target QSAR models.

Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor GRP-Preferring Bombesin Receptor Grpr GRP-R. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus and is classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR GRP-related receptor.

It has multiple descriptions including plasma membrane and membrane components, and functions involving G protein-coupled receptor activity, bombesin receptor activity, protein binding, neuropeptide receptor activity, and G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity. It also participates in various biological processes such as signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, learning or memory, bombesin receptor signaling pathway, social behavior, psychomotor behavior, regulation of cell population proliferation, response to external biotic stimulus, motor behavior, and positive regulation of respiratory gaseous exchange.
