QSAR-TID-10620 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10620. The dataset has sixty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10620. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Serotonin two a receptor, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including temperature homeostasis, glycolytic process, and neurotransmission.

The Serotonin two a receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including behavior, memory, and vasoconstriction. It is also involved in the regulation of dopamine secretion and phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic process.
