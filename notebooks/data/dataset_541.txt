Please cite: Tables of counts in GLIM ready format used for the analyses in a study on "The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility" published in American Sociological Review. For further details of the data, see this reference.

The dataset contains information on father's occupation, son's occupation, family structure, race, and counts for son's first and current occupations. Occupations are coded from Professional, Self Employed to Farm Laborer, with various categories in between such as Manager, Salesman, Craftsman, Service Worker, and Operative.

Family structure is coded as intact family background or nonintact family background. Race is coded as white or black. The counts have been weighted to account for the survey design, resulting in non integer values.

This file was constructed from publicly available data collected in the "Occupational Change in a Generation II" (OCG II) Survey.

The dataset features include father's occupation, son's occupation, family structure, race, counts for son's first occupation, and counts for son's current occupation. It is a numeric dataset with no specific class index.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying intergenerational social mobility, the impact of family structure on occupational attainment, and racial differences in career trajectories. It allows for analysis of how father's occupation influences son's first and current occupations, and how these relationships may be moderated by family background and race.
