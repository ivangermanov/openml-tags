QSAR-TID-262 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 262. The dataset has 429 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The Prostanoid EP4 receptor is a single protein target, also known as the Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 subtype, PGE2 receptor EP4 subtype, and Prostanoid EP4 receptor. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor group and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and bone development.

The receptor is activated by prostaglandin E2, a lipid-like ligand, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cytokine production, signal transduction, and cell differentiation. It is also involved in the regulation of ossification, response to mechanical stimulus, and response to lipopolysaccharide.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Prostanoid EP4 receptor. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization, among other applications.
