QSAR-TID-14071 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14071, and it consists of thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project was conducted in September two thousand fifteen. This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14071. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset has thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
