QSAR-TID-14071 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14071. The dataset has thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14071. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Human Herpesvirus four protease/capsid scaffold protein, which is a single protein target.

The Human Herpesvirus four protease/capsid scaffold protein is a serine-type endopeptidase that plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle. It is responsible for proteolysis, viral process, and viral release from host cell. The protein is localized in the host cell cytoplasm and nucleus.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop QSAR models for predicting the activity of compounds against the Human Herpesvirus four protease/capsid scaffold protein.
