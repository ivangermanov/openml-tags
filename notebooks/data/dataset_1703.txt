This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred forty-three two, and it has two ninety-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and nine hundred twenty-six more.
