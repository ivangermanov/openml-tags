QSAR-TID-101332 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101332. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the drug target TID: 101332.

The drug target TID: 101332 is a protein kinase that belongs to the NUAK family of SNF1-like kinases. It is also known as AMPK-related protein kinase five and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, DNA damage response, and regulation of cell population proliferation.

The protein is expressed in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm of cells and is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including the p53 signaling pathway.
