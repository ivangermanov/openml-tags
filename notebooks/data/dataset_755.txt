Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Family Medical History, Total Medical Intelligence Quotient, Age to Intelligence Quotient at various stages

This dataset focuses on medical and intelligence-related factors across different age groups. It has been processed to create a binary classification system based on target values, allowing for simplified analysis of positive and negative outcomes. The original numeric data has been transformed to facilitate easier categorization and comparison of results. Researchers studying the relationship between medical history, intelligence quotients, and age-related cognitive development may find this dataset particularly useful for their investigations.
