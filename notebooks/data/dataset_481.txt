The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function includes five features for input. Additional features are added to the datasets to measure the effects of nonrelated features. 

These added features are independent from the output; however, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies, including five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred, where only the first five features are related to the output, and the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples also varies, including one hundred, two hundred fifty, five hundred, and one thousand. 

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four. For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. 

The last attribute in each file is the target.
