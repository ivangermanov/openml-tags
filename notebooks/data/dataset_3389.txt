QSAR-TID-12788 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12788. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains fifty rows and over one thousand features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The target protein is Estrogen Receptor Alpha, also known as ER-alpha, Esr, Esr1, Estr, Estradiol Receptor. It is a single protein and a transcription factor/nuclear receptor/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 3/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 3 group A/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 3 group A member 1.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, antral ovarian follicle growth, epithelial cell development, osteoblast development, and regulation of DNA-templated transcription. It is also involved in various cellular components, including chromatin, euchromatin, nucleus, transcription regulator complex, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and membrane.

The protein has various molecular functions, including RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding, TFIIB-class transcription factor binding, transcription coregulator binding, transcription corepressor binding, and DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific.
