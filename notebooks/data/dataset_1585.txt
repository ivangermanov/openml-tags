This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Histamine H3 Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It has been used for machine learning purposes, specifically Multi Task Learning QSAR.

The dataset provides information about the Histamine H3 Receptor, a single protein target classified as a membrane receptor and a family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, neurotransmitter regulation, and synaptic transmission. The receptor is also associated with various diseases, including cognitive disorders and metabolic disorders.

The dataset includes molecular fingerprints, which are a way to represent molecules as binary vectors. These fingerprints can be used for similarity searching, clustering, and machine learning algorithms.
