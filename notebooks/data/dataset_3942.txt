QSAR-TID-101034 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101034, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type Three, also known as NT-Three Growth Factor Receptor, GP One Forty Five-TrkC, and Trk-C. This receptor is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase, belonging to the Trk family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type Three is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including nervous system development, heart development, and cell differentiation. It is also involved in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and cell migration.

The receptor has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Several small molecule inhibitors of the receptor have been developed, including AZD-7451, Lestaurtinib, and PLX-7486, which have shown promising results in preclinical studies.
