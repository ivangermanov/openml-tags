Delays Zurich Transport dataset is a collection of public transport delay data in Zurich, covering the period from October 30 to November 27. This dataset was cleaned and prepared on Open Data Day in 2017. To make the data more manageable, the task was downscaled to 0.5 percent of the original size. As part of the preparation process, some features were recoded as factors, and new time features were computed to provide more insights.

The dataset includes a range of features, such as the delay, type of vehicle, line number, direction, stop identification, day of the week, time, temperature, maximum wind speed, average wind speed, precipitation, dew point, and humidity. Additionally, new time-related features were added, including hour, day minute, hours, minutes, and seconds.
