Name: Road Safety Seed Four Rows Two Thousand Columns One Hundred Classes Ten Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Road Safety with seed equals four, arguments nrows equals two thousand, arguments ncols equals one hundred, arguments nclasses equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, if the number of columns is greater than the maximum allowed, it randomly selects a subset of columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows.

Finally, it returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
