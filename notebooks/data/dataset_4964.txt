**Hailfinder Bayesian Network**

The Hailfinder Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, resulting in two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, while the average degree is two point three six, with a maximum in-degree of four.

This Bayesian system is designed for forecasting severe weather, specifically hail storms. It takes into account various atmospheric conditions and factors that contribute to the formation of hail.

Some of the key features included in this network are Cap In Scene, Middle Level Lapse Rate, Wind Aloft, Low-Level Lapse Rate, Scene Relative Atmospheric Moisture Content Index, Combined Moisture, Mean Relative Humidity, Synthetic Forcing, Atmospheric Instability Mountains, and more.
