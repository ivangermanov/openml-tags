CERN Electron Collision Data
Tags: Context

This dataset contains one hundred thousand dielectron events in the invariant mass range of two to one hundred ten GeV for use in outreach and education. These data were selected for use in education and outreach and contain a subset of the total event information. The selection criteria may be different from that used in CMS physics results.

Content

The dataset includes the following information for each event:

* Run: The run number of the event, which identifies the specific run during which the data was collected.
* Event: The event number, which uniquely identifies each event within a run.
* Electron One and Electron Two: The total energy of each electron, measured in GeV, which represents the energy of the electron.
* Momentum Components: The components of the momentum of each electron, measured in GeV, which describe the direction and magnitude of the electron's motion.
* Transverse Momentum: The transverse momentum of each electron, measured in GeV, which represents the component of the electron's momentum perpendicular to the beam direction.
* Pseudorapidity: The pseudorapidity of each electron, which is a measure of the electron's angle with respect to the beam direction.
* Phi Angle: The phi angle of each electron, measured in radians, which represents the electron's azimuthal angle with respect to the beam direction.
* Charge: The charge of each electron, which can be either positive or negative.
* Invariant Mass: The invariant mass of the two electrons, measured in GeV, which is a measure of the mass of the system formed by the two electrons.
