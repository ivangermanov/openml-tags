QSAR-TID-106 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 106. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains a wide range of compounds with activity values on the Serotonin 1b receptor, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and behavior. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin.

The dataset can be used for various purposes, including the development of predictive models for Serotonin 1b receptor activity, the identification of new compounds with potential therapeutic activity, and the optimization of existing compounds.
