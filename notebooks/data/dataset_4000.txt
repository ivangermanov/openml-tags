This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred six, and it has many rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.

It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred six.

The dataset has many rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.
