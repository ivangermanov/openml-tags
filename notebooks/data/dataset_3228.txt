QSAR-TID-12391 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12391. The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12391. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-gamma, which is a single protein target. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of DNA-templated transcription, peripheral nervous system development, heart development, and skeletal muscle tissue development.

The dataset also contains information on the expression of the receptor in different tissues and cells, as well as its role in various diseases and disorders. The receptor is known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders.
