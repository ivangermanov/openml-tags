The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number".

These datasets are some of the most widely used functions for data generation, including both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function includes five features for input and is defined as y equals ten times the sine of pi times x one times x two plus twenty times the square of x three minus point five plus ten times X four plus five times X five plus e.

To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values are given below. The number of features varies, including five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. The number of samples also varies, including one hundred, two hundred and fifty, five hundred, and one thousand. Additionally, there are five different colinearity degrees, ranging from zero to four.

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
