First Order Theorem Proving Seed One 

Tags: Subsampling of the First Order Theorem Proving dataset 

Generated with the following source code:

def subsample(self, seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, stratified) -> Dataset:
random number generator = numpy random default random generator with the given seed 
x equals the input features 
y equals the output labels 

Uniformly sample classes equals unique values in the output labels 
if there are more classes than the maximum allowed, 
select the most frequent classes based on their occurrence probability 
Select the indices where one of these classes is present 
Update input features and output labels to only include these indices 

If there are more columns than the maximum allowed, 
uniformly select a subset of columns 
Update input features to only include these columns 

If there are more rows than the maximum allowed, 
split the data into a subset using stratified sampling 
Update input features and output labels to only include this subset 

Convert categorical columns to string format for OpenML 
Return a new dataset object with the updated input features, output labels, categorical mask, and column names
