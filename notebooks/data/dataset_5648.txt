**COMET_MC**

The COMET experiment, currently under construction at the J-PARC proton beam laboratory in Japan, aims to search for coherent neutrino-less conversion of a muon to an electron, a process that breaks the law of lepton conservation. If detected, it will be a signal of new physics. The previous upper limit for this decay was set by the SINDRUM II experiment. COMET is designed to have a significantly better sensitivity.

The Cylindrical Drift Chamber is the primary detector for physics measurements in COMET Phase-I. Specifically, the momentum of resulting particles will be measured using the CyDet, a cylindrical wire array detector. The particles flying out of the muon-stopping target and registered by the CyDet. Among those, we are interested in tracks left by electrons with specific energy, which are produced by muon to electron conversion.

The CyDet consists of sensitive wires organized in layers. Each wire measures the energy deposited by a passing charged particle. Within each of the layers, the wires have the same distance to the stopping target and stereometry angle.

There is a magnetic field in the detector, which causes electrons to move in a helical path. This electron deposits energy in the wires close to the flight path. The radius of the helix is proportional to the transverse momentum of the electron.

The energy deposited on each wire is measured at the end plate of the cylindrical detector. An example of the resulting signal event can be seen below, where blue dots are background hits and red are hits from signal electrons.

More details about the COMET experiment can be found on the official website, in the conceptual design report, and in various articles and presentations.

**Important note**
Datasets available for this challenge are results of preliminary Monte Carlo simulation. They don't completely represent properties of COMET's detector and thus cannot be used to estimate final properties of the tracking system, but are appropriate to test different approaches to tracking.
