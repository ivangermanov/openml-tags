This dataset belongs to the "Regression on Categorical and Numerical Features" benchmark. It is a part of the Tabular Data Benchmark, which provides a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models on various datasets.

The NYC Taxi Green December 2016 dataset is comprised of Trip Record Data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. This dataset includes records of trips taken by the green taxi line in December 2016. The data was downloaded from the commission's website.

For a detailed description of all variables present in the dataset, please refer to the commission's website. The target variable chosen for this dataset is Tip Amount. The Total Amount variable has been excluded to prevent deterministic prediction of the target variable.

Date variables, namely Pickup DateTime and Dropoff DateTime, have been ignored by default. However, these variables can be utilized to derive additional time-based features. To increase the significance of categorical features such as Pickup Location ID and Drop-off Location ID, this version of the dataset only includes trips where the Payment Type is Credit Card, as tips are not typically included for other payment methods. Furthermore, the variables Trip Distance and Fare Amount have been removed.

Features include Vendor ID, Store and Forward Flag, Rate Code ID, Passenger Count, Extra, MTA Tax, Tolls Amount, Improvement Surcharge, Trip Type, and Tip Amount.
