The Auto Mpg Dataset has been binarized, which involves converting its numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process is achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset is associated with various tags, including Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, and Study.

The dataset comprises several features, namely Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight, Acceleration, Model Year, and Origin, which are used to classify instances into Positive or Negative categories.
