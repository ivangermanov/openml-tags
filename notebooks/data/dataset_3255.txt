QSAR-TID-12786 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12786. The dataset has a total of six hundred and twenty-four rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September 2015. The dataset should be cited as it is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of QSAR modeling.

The molecular fingerprints are a type of descriptor that can be used to characterize the structure of molecules. They are often used in QSAR modeling to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target. In this dataset, the molecular fingerprints are represented as a series of binary digits, or bits, that describe the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for drug target TID 12786. It provides a large and diverse set of compounds with associated activity values, which can be used to train and test QSAR models.
