Timing Attack Dataset Created Thirty Five Micro Seconds Delay 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Bleichenbacher Timing Attack 

This dataset was created to study the Bleichenbacher Timing Attack, which is a type of side-channel attack used to compromise encrypted data. The dataset contains features extracted from network traffic related to the attack.

Attribute Descriptions:

Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, reserved flags, nonce flags, congestion window reduced flags, echo congestion notification flags, urgent flags, acknowledgement flags, push flags, reset flags, synchronize flags, finish flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.

TLS Alert attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, reserved flags, nonce flags, congestion window reduced flags, echo congestion notification flags, urgent flags, acknowledgement flags, push flags, reset flags, synchronize flags, finish flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and message order.

TCP Disconnect attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, reserved flags, nonce flags, congestion window reduced flags, echo congestion notification flags, urgent flags, acknowledgement flags, push flags, reset flags, synchronize flags, finish flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.
