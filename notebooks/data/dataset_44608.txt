Name: PC Four Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset PC Four with seed equals zero arguments N Rows equals two thousand arguments N Columns equals one hundred arguments N Classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals false

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of each class.

It then selects the indices where one of the selected classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns.

If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly using the target variable and selects a subset of the data.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
