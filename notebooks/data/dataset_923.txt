This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The features included in this dataset are Northing, Easting, Resistivity, and Binary Class.
