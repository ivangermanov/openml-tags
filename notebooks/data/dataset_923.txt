Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for a binary classification approach to the soil visualization problem. The dataset includes geographical coordinates (northing and easting), soil resistivity measurements, and an ISNS value. The primary output is the binary classification of soil characteristics.
