Inspiration 
This dataset offers numerous possibilities for exploration. For instance, one could develop a popularity-based recommender system, where games are recommended based on the count of ratings received by each title. The underlying assumption here is that the game with the highest number of ratings is the most popular. Alternatively, one could design a content-based recommender system, where games are suggested based on their features and similarities with those of other games in the dataset.
