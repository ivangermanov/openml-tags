The Fri C Two Dataset has been binarized, converting its numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process involves calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset features include Oz One, Oz Two, Oz Three, Oz Four, Oz Five, Oz Six, Oz Seven, Oz Eight, Oz Nine, and Oz Ten, along with the Binary Class.
