Title of Database: Spoken Arabic Digit

Abstract: This dataset contains time series of mel frequency cepstrum coefficients corresponding to spoken Arabic digits. It includes data from native Arabic speakers, comprising equal numbers of males and females. The dataset provides a comprehensive representation of spoken Arabic digits.

Source: Data was collected by the Laboratory of Automatic and Signals at the University of Badji-Mokhtar Annaba, Algeria.

The dataset was adapted and preprocessed at the Faculty of Engineering, Al-Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Data Set Information: The dataset consists of time series of thirteen frequency cepstral coefficients taken from eighty-eight native Arabic speakers between the ages of eighteen and forty to represent ten spoken Arabic digits. Each speaker repeated each digit ten times, resulting in a total of eight thousand eight hundred recordings.

Attribute Information: Each line in the database represents thirteen mel frequency cepstral coefficients in increasing order, separated by spaces. These coefficients correspond to one analysis frame. The thirteen mel frequency cepstral coefficients were computed under specific conditions, including a sampling rate of eleven thousand twenty-five hertz, sixteen-bit resolution, and the application of a Hamming window and filter pre-emphasis.

Relevant Papers: Research papers have been published utilizing this dataset, including an improved tree model for Arabic speech recognition and a tree distribution classifier for automatic spoken Arabic digit recognition.
