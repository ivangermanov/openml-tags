**Vowel Recognition**

This dataset involves speaker-independent recognition of the eleven steady-state vowels of British English using a specified training set of LPC-derived log area ratios.

**Description**

Collected by David Deterding, Mahesan Niranjan, and Tony Robinson, this comprehensive dataset aims to recognize vowels spoken by different individuals. The dataset consists of a three-dimensional array: vowel data [speaker, vowel, input]. There are fifteen individual speakers, each speaking each vowel six times. For each utterance, there are ten floating-point input values.

**Problem Statement**

The goal is to train a network using data from speakers zero to forty-seven and then test the network on speakers forty-eight to eighty-nine, reporting the number of correct classifications in the test set. This problem falls under the category of impossible connectionist problems, meaning those without an exact solution.

**Methodology**

Report the number of test vowels classified correctly, i.e., the number of occurrences when the distance of the correct output to the actual output was the smallest of the set of distances from the actual output to all possible target outputs. Additionally, report the training time, measured in pattern presentations or floating-point operations required, and the level of success achieved on the training and testing data after various amounts of training. Precisely describe the network topology and algorithm used.

**Variations**

This benchmark encourages exploring different node types. Experiment with various approaches, and correspond with the authors via email if needed. Discussions on using a cross-entropy distance measure would be particularly interesting.

**Notes**

Each result is based on a single trial with random starting weights. Computational limitations restricted the number of trials. Performance peaks at around two hundred fifty correct, after which it decays to varying degrees. Final performance figures are reported after approximately three thousand trials, not the peak performance obtained during the run.
