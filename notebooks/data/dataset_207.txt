Auto Price Dataset

Tags: Automotive, Price Prediction, Machine Learning

This dataset contains information about various automobile characteristics, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses compared to other cars. The insurance risk rating indicates how risky a car is relative to its price, with higher values suggesting increased risk. Actuaries use a process called "symboling" to adjust these ratings. A value of +3 indicates a risky automobile, while -3 suggests a relatively safe one. The normalized losses represent the average loss payment per insured vehicle year, adjusted for vehicle size classification.

The dataset comprises three main types of information: automobile specifications, assigned insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses in use. It includes a total of 205 instances with 26 attributes, consisting of 15 continuous variables, 1 integer variable, and 10 nominal variables. These attributes cover various aspects of automobiles, including make, fuel type, aspiration, body style, engine characteristics, and performance metrics.

Some of the key attributes in the dataset include symboling (ranging from -3 to +3), normalized losses (continuous from 65 to 256), wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine size, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, and price. The price attribute ranges from 5,118 to 45,400 and is treated as the class attribute in some analyses.

The dataset has been used in various machine learning studies, including instance based prediction of real valued attributes. Previous research has compared instance based learning algorithms with linear regression for predicting car prices, achieving a percent average deviation error of 11.84% for the instance based learning algorithm and 14.12% for linear regression.

It's worth noting that the original dataset contained some missing values, which were denoted by "?" in certain attributes. Some studies have chosen to discard instances with missing values to create a complete dataset for analysis.

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of automobile characteristics and their relationship to price and risk, making it valuable for various machine learning and data analysis tasks in the automotive industry.
