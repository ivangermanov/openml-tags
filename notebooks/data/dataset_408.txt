This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies include research on carbolenes, melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity descriptors, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro and bromoalkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, stability of purposely modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The datasets cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, utilizing various computational and experimental methods to analyze structure-activity relationships, predict toxicity, assess biodegradability, and explore molecular interactions. These studies contribute to the fields of medicinal chemistry, environmental science, and drug design.
