This is one of forty-one drug design datasets. The datasets with eleven hundred forty-three features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies.

The DePreux dataset is part of these drug design datasets. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies include Carbolenes, MTP Two, Chang, Cristalli, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two.

These datasets were created using a diverse range of sources, including the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science, and the European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.

Some of the specific topics covered in these datasets include the prediction of melting points, the classification of solid drugs, and the development of linear, ensemble, and non-linear models for the prediction and interpretation of biological activity.

Other datasets include Benzo Thirty-Two, Phenetyl One, PAH, PDGF-R, Phen, Topo Two One, Y Prop Four One, QSAR BR One, QSAR BR Two, QSARTOX, QSBR RW One, QSBR Y Two, QSBR Alks, QSFR DH LA, QSFSR One, QSFSR Two, QS PCR CMPX, and Selwood.

Keywords: drug design, machine learning, mathematics, chemistry, medicinal chemistry.
