This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: One Hundred Three Thousand One Hundred Forty, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about a single protein preferred name, Serine Threonine Protein Kinase TAO Two, also known as hKFC-C, KIAA Eighty-Eight One, Kinase from Chicken Homolog C, MAP Three Kinase Seventeen, Prostate-Derived STE Twenty-Like Kinase One.
