Eighty Years of Canadian Climate Data
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics

This dataset has been compiled from public sources, providing a comprehensive collection of daily temperatures and precipitation from thirteen Canadian centers. Precipitation is categorized as either rain or snow, with snow being more likely during winter months.

The dataset spans over eight decades, with daily data available for seven out of thirteen centers starting from nineteen forty. By nineteen sixty, daily data from all thirteen centers was available, although some occasional missing values were present. Since few of Canada's weather stations have operated continuously, it was necessary to combine data from various sources to create a cohesive dataset.

Our primary source of data is derived from Environment and Climate Change Canada's website, which provides daily climate data. We have extracted data from the following weather stations: Calgary International Airport, Edmonton International Airport, Halifax Stanfield International Airport, Moncton Airport, Montreal/Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, Ottawa International Airport, Quebec/Jean Lesage International Airport, Saskatoon Diefenbaker International Airport, St John's Airport, Toronto International Airport, Vancouver International Airport, Whitehorse Airport, and Winnipeg Richardson International Airport.

This dataset is particularly suited for time series forecasting applications. Additionally, the data can be utilized for anomaly detection in multiple time series, as demonstrated by our team at Penny Analytics.
