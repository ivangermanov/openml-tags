QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is AMP activated protein kinase, alpha subunit, also known as AMP activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha, ACACA kinase, Acetyl CoA carboxylase kinase, AMPK, and AMPK. It is classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK family/CAMK protein kinase AMPK subfamily. The organism is Homo sapiens.

The protein has various Gene Ontology annotations, including nucleotide binding, chromatin binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and metal ion binding for molecular functions. Its biological processes include chromatin organization, protein phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, autophagy, signal transduction, and regulation of gene expression. It is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and other cellular components.

This kinase is involved in energy homeostasis, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. It responds to cellular stresses and nutrient levels, regulating processes like autophagy, apoptosis, and circadian rhythms. The protein interacts with various pathways including Wnt signaling and TOR signaling.

The dataset provides molecular fingerprints that can be used to develop quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting compound activity on this target. Such models could aid in drug discovery efforts targeting AMP activated protein kinase.
