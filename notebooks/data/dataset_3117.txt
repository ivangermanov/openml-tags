The QSAR-TID-11017 dataset is a collection of QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11017. This dataset contains 1211 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The target protein is Glycogen Synthase Kinase Three Alpha, which is a single protein and a preferred name. It is also known as Glycogen Synthase Kinase Three and belongs to the protein family Glycogen Synthase Kinase Three. The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification.

The protein target classification description relationship accession is Glycogen Synthase Kinase Three Alpha Single Protein P four nine eight four zero. There are many mechanisms of action, including max phase and first approval USAN stem references.

The dataset includes information on expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process. The go component includes nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, cytosol, axon, beta-catenin destruction complex, neuronal cell body, apical dendrite, postsynapse, and proximal dendrite.

The go function includes nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, signaling receptor binding, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein kinase A catalytic subunit binding, tau protein binding, and tau protein kinase activity.

The go process includes regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, cardiac left ventrile morphogenesis, carbohydrate metabolic process, glycogen metabolic process, regulation of gene expression by genomic imprinting, protein phosphorylation, dopamine receptor signaling pathway, nervous system development, insulin receptor signaling pathway, negative regulation of signal transduction, positive regulation of autophagy, positive regulation of gene expression, and many others.
