QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo-pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Glycogen synthase kinase alpha protein, a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. This enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including carbohydrate metabolism, insulin receptor signaling, and nervous system development. It plays roles in cellular processes such as protein phosphorylation, regulation of gene expression, and autophagy.

Glycogen synthase kinase alpha is associated with multiple cellular components, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and various neuronal structures. Its functions encompass protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and interactions with other proteins such as tau and beta-catenin.

The protein is involved in numerous biological pathways, including Wnt signaling, insulin response, and regulation of heart contraction. It also participates in disease-related processes, such as Alzheimer's disease through its role in amyloid-beta formation and tau protein phosphorylation.

Several databases and resources provide information on this protein target, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and various pathway databases like Reactome. The dataset may be valuable for researchers studying drug interactions, protein function, and disease mechanisms related to Glycogen synthase kinase alpha.
