This dataset contains weighted census data extracted from the Current Population Surveys conducted by the United States Census Bureau. The data contains forty-one demographic and employment-related variables. The instance weight indicates the number of people in the population that each record represents due to stratified sampling. To do real analysis and derive conclusions, this field must be used. This attribute should not be used in the classifiers.

The dataset was split into train and test files in approximately two-thirds, one-third proportions using MineSet's MIndUtil mineset-to-mlc. There are instances in the data file and in the test file.
