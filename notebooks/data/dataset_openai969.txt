The dataset named OVA Endometrium is a collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be used to estimate various quality metrics such as accuracy, precision, and area under ROC curve for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms. The data in this repository originates from the expO (Expression Project For Oncology) repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The expO project aims to obtain tissue samples under standardized conditions and conduct gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The availability of this data without intellectual property restrictions benefits patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies. The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, and the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies. When publishing material based on the GEMLeR datasets, it is important to acknowledge the assistance received from this repository. Researchers are encouraged to cite the repository as well as the original source of the gene expression samples. The dataset features a large number of gene identifiers that can be used for analysis and research purposes. Keywords: gene expression, machine learning, benchmarking, expO, microarray platform, tumor samples, genotype-phenotype studies, benchmarking algorithms.
