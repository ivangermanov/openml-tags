The QSAR-TID-179 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Cysteinyl Leukotriene Receptor One. This dataset has one hundred twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent Fingerprint Circular Fragment bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Cysteinyl Leukotriene Receptor One. The activity values are measured in pseudo-pIC fifty units.

The Cysteinyl Leukotriene Receptor One is a single protein target that belongs to the family of small molecule receptors and lipid-like ligand receptors. It is primarily found in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, calcium ion transport, chemotaxis, defense response, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway.
