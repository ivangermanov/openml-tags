Metamaterial-Antennas Tags: Context

Microstrip antennas are low-profile antennas that are widely applied in high-performance aircraft, spacecraft, satellite, and missile applications, where size, weight, performance, ease of installation, and aerodynamic profile are significant constraints. In addition, they are also used in civilian applications, including mobile communication and wireless connection.

Metamaterials are specific dispositions of unit cells that exhibit peculiar electrical properties. These materials present properties that do not exist in nature. Due to their unique dispositions, electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability are negative. This produces negative refraction, which makes electromagnetic radiation behave differently from what is expected.

In order to optimize antenna projects, why not apply machine learning? This could potentially lead to significant improvements in antenna design and performance.
