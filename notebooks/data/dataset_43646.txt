Metamaterial-Antennas 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Microstrip antennas are low-profile antennas commonly utilized in high-performance aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles, where stringent constraints include size, weight, performance, ease of installation, and aerodynamic profile. Moreover, these antennas have found applications in civilian domains, particularly in mobile communication and wireless connections.

Metamaterials refer to specific arrangements of unit cells that exhibit unique electrical properties not found in nature. The distinctive disposition of these materials results in negative electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability, leading to negative refraction. Consequently, electromagnetic radiation behaves differently than expected.

Inspired by the potential benefits of optimizing antenna projects, why not leverage machine learning? By applying machine learning algorithms, it may be possible to enhance the design and performance of metamaterial-based microstrip antennas.
