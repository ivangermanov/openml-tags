This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex aud/usd pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans a specific date range and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends.

The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the Close Bid and the Close Ask of the following day, relative to the Close Bid and Close Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean Close price is expected to increase the following day, and false when the mean Close price is expected to decrease or remain the same the following day.

The dataset includes several attributes that provide insight into the Forex market. These attributes include the timestamp of each data point, bid prices at the open, high, low, and close of each time interval, as well as the volume of bid price changes during that interval. Additionally, the dataset includes ask prices at the open, high, low, and close of each time interval, along with the volume of ask price changes during that interval.
