This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one seventeen twenty-two, and it has sixty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-six other features representing FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling.

The drug target is Cathepsin E, a single protein preferred name also known as Cathepsin E Form I, Cathepsin E Form II, and CTSE. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, aspartic protease, Aspartic protease AA clan, Aspartic protease A1A subfamily.

It is involved in various biological processes including proteolysis, protein autoprocessing, and antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II. It is located in the endosome and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle and performs functions such as aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and identical protein binding.
