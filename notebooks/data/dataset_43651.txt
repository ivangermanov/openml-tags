Winedata Tags: Context Thinking of Natural Language Processing as a Beginner

The dataset is comprised of wine comments or reviews provided by various wine tasters. The primary concept is to utilize text classification to categorize the commenters based on their reviews. This is mainly used to demonstrate the techniques involved in natural language processing. The assumption is that every taster has a unique style of describing their object of interest, which can be identified and classified.

The dataset contains columns that include the reviews, country and provinces of wines, their variety, and winery they belong to, along with the commenters or tasters.

Acknowledgements are due to the Kaggle dataset for wine data with comments, as well as the courses regarding natural language processing, which were very helpful in understanding and implementing the concept.

Features include the reviews, country, description, designation, price, province, region, title, variety, and winery.
