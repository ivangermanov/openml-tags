Computer Systems and Machine Learning Context 

Considering Natural Language Processing as a Beginner 

The dataset utilized revolves around wine comments or reviews furnished by diverse wine tasters. The primary objective is to employ text classification to categorize the commenters based on their reviews. This exercise primarily aims to demonstrate the techniques involved in language processing. It is assumed that each taster possesses a unique style of describing their object of interest.

Content 

The columns comprise reviews, country and provinces of wines, their variety, and the winery they belong to, alongside the commenters or tasters.

Acknowledgments
