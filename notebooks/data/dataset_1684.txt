QSAR-TID-118 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 118. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. 

It contains information about the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, which is a single protein. Its preferred name is Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, and it belongs to the species group Homo sapiens.

This receptor has various synonyms and is classified under the description relationship accession number P30968.

There are multiple molecules associated with this receptor, including Nafarelin, Abarelix, Goselerin, Triptorelin, and Ganirelix Acetate. These molecules have different mechanisms of action, maximum phases, and first approval dates.

The Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, gonadotropin secretion, cellular response to hormone stimulus, and cellular response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

It is also associated with various Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes, including plasma membrane, membrane, G protein-coupled receptor activity, peptide binding, and protein-hormone receptor activity.
