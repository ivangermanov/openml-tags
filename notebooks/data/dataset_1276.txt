Scraped Data:

The scraped data includes information about the Serine/threonine-protein kinase Aurora-B, also known as Aurora kinase B, which is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. It plays a crucial role in regulating the progression of the cell cycle, particularly during the mitotic phase.

The data also provides information about various small molecules that inhibit the activity of Serine/threonine-protein kinase Aurora-B, including ENMD-2076, BARASERTIB, PF-03814735, AT-9283, and TAK-901. These small molecules have been shown to exhibit anti-tumor properties and are being investigated as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.

In addition, the scraped data includes information about the expression of Serine/threonine-protein kinase Aurora-B in various tissues and its involvement in different biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair.
