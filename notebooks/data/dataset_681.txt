The data sets in this directory are taken from the book "The Multivariate Social Scientist: Introductory Statistics Using Generalized Linear Models" published by SAGE Publications. The data are presented in two formats: ASCII and SPSS portable. GLIM code and macros are provided in separate files. Please refer to the errata file for minor differences between these data sets and those reported in the book.

The data files cover various topics including video games and hostility, normal and skewed errors, curvilinearity, simple models, cost and sound quality, exam marks and college offers, quality of children's testimonies, infection severity and treatment outcomes, job satisfaction for doctors and dentists, race, housing and illness, dopamine and psychosis, treatment and depression, and alcohol consumption and libido.

Some data sets include additional information such as age groups, gender, location types, treatment outcomes, and hospital identifiers. Certain files contain dummy codes or alternative scoring methods.

The child witness data set includes information on prosecution. It should be noted that there are slight differences in parameters obtained using different file formats due to decimal place precision.

The data can be freely used for non commercial purposes and can be freely distributed. Users are requested to cite the book when using this data.
