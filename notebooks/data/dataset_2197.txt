This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand thirty-two zero, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty. The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The QSAR-TID-one thousand thirty-two zero dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project. It contains one hundred thirty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and median PX C fifty values. The molecular fingerprints were generated using the FCFP six one thousand twenty-four method, which creates a binary vector representing the presence or absence of specific molecular features.

The molecule identifiers include the Molecule ChEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each molecule in the ChEMBL database. The median PX C fifty values represent the activity of each compound on the drug target.

The dataset was generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, a software tool for cheminformatics and bioinformatics analysis. The program was used to generate the molecular fingerprints from the SMILES strings, which are a notation for describing molecular structures.
