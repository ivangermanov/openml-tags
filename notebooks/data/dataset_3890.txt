QSAR-TID-103584 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103584. The dataset has thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103584. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is related to the C-C motif chemokine five, which is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune response. The protein is involved in the recruitment of immune cells to the site of inflammation and is a potential target for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the C-C motif chemokine five. The dataset can be used to develop and validate QSAR models, which can be used to predict the activity of new compounds and identify potential leads for further development.
