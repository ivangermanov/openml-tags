Subsampling of the dataset KC One with seed equals two, where the maximum number of rows is two thousand, the maximum number of columns is one hundred, the maximum number of classes is ten, and stratification is true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

If the number of columns in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of columns, the function uniformly samples columns to reduce the number of columns to the maximum. It then selects the corresponding columns from the dataset.

If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. This ensures that the class distribution in the subsample is similar to the class distribution in the original dataset.

The function returns a new dataset that contains the subsampled data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
