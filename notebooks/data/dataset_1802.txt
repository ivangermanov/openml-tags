The QSAR-TID-102576 dataset is a collection of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data, which is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September 2015. This dataset shows the activity values of various compounds on a specific drug target, identified by the tag TID: 102576.

The dataset consists of seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature called Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating these fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated. The dataset includes molecule chembl ids, fingerprint features, and median pxc fifty.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for machine learning and predictive modeling applications.
