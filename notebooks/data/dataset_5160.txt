This is the dataset from the Atlas Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014, categorized under Chemistry and Life Science. 

The data was downloaded from the Cern website, which also hosts the comprehensive documentation of the data. For further insight into the challenge, one may visit the Kaggle competition page, the official challenge website, and the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research competition proceedings.

Some important notes regarding this dataset include: 

* In this version, all instances of -999 have been replaced with Not a Number (NaN).
* This version only encompasses the data utilized by the Kaggle competition, consisting of the initial eight hundred thousand samples.
