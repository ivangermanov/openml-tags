The Determinants of Wages from the Nineteen Eighty-Five Current Population Survey

Summary:

The Current Population Survey is used to supplement census information between census years. These data consist of a random sample of five hundred thirty-four persons from the Current Population Survey, with information on wages and other characteristics of the workers, including sex, number of years of education, years of work experience, occupational status, region of residence, and union membership. We wish to determine whether wages are related to these characteristics and whether there is a gender gap in wages.

Based on residual plots, wages were log transformed to stabilize the variance. Age and work experience were almost perfectly correlated. Multiple regression of log wages against sex, age, years of education, work experience, union membership, southern residence, and occupational status showed that these covariates were related to wages. The effect of age was not significant after controlling for experience.

Standardized residual plots showed no patterns, except for one large outlier with lower wages than expected. This was a male, with twenty-two years of experience and twelve years of education, in a management position, who lived in the north and was not a union member. Removing this person from the analysis did not substantially change the results, so that the final model included the entire sample.

Adjusting for all other variables in the model, females earned eighty-one percent the wages of males. Wages increased forty-one percent for every five additional years of education. They increased by eleven percent for every additional ten years of experience. Union members were paid twenty-three percent more than non-union members. Northerners were paid eleven percent more than Southerners. Management and professional positions were paid most, and service and clerical positions were paid least. Overall variance explained was thirty-five percent.

In summary, many factors describe the variations in wages: occupational status, years of experience, years of education, sex, union membership, and region of residence. However, despite adjustment for all factors that were available, there still appeared to be a gender gap in wages. There is no readily available explanation for this gender gap.

Description:

The data file contains five hundred thirty-four observations on eleven variables sampled from the Current Population Survey of nineteen eighty-five. This data set demonstrates multiple regression, confounding, transformations, multicollinearity, categorical variables, ANOVA, pooled tests of significance, interactions, and model-building strategies.

Variable names in order from left to right: 

Education refers to the number of years of education. 
South refers to an indicator variable for Southern Region (one equals Person lives in South, zero equals Person lives elsewhere).
Sex refers to an indicator variable for sex (one equals Female, zero equals Male).
Experience refers to the number of years of work experience.
Union refers to an indicator variable for union membership (one equals Union member, zero equals Not union member).
Wage refers to wage (dollars per hour).
Age refers to age (years).
