Tags: Subsampling of the Bioresponse dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Bioresponse dataset, generated with a seed of two. The subsample has a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsampling process was stratified to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the classes were uniformly sampled to select the required number of classes. Then, the indices where one of these classes is present were selected. The columns were also uniformly sampled to select the required number of columns.

The dataset was then split into a subset of the required size using stratified sampling. The categorical columns were converted to string format for OpenML compatibility.
