The Water Bayesian Network is a sample network in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, referenced online. This network consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is around four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

This network was created as part of an expert system for control of waste water treatment, focusing on the management of wastewater reclamation processes. It represents relationships between various factors influencing wastewater treatment, including chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen levels, and other key indicators.

The network structure and parameters were designed to model complex interactions within wastewater treatment systems, enabling probabilistic inference and decision-making under uncertainty. By capturing dependencies between variables, this Bayesian network provides a powerful tool for evaluating and optimizing wastewater treatment operations.

Keywords: Bayesian network, wastewater treatment, probabilistic modeling, decision-making under uncertainty, chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen levels.
