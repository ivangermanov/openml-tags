The CJS dataset, tagged under Chemistry and Life Science, is a binarized version of the original data set. This means that the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the majority class was relabeled as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all other classes were relabeled as Negative, denoted by 'N'.

This conversion process was originally performed to simplify the complexity of the target feature. As a result, the dataset now consists of a range of features, including Tree, Branch, Leaf, Internode, and Binary Class.
