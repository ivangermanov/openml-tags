Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: owl, percent ring one, percent ring two, percent ring three, percent ring four, percent ring five, percent ring six, binary class

This dataset, known as Sleuth Ex, is a modified version of an original dataset with unknown origins. The primary modification involves the binarization of the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This conversion is achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive ('P') or negative ('N') based on their relation to this computed mean. Instances with target values below the mean are classified as positive, while those at or above the mean are designated as negative. The dataset includes several features related to owl characteristics and ring percentages, culminating in a binary classification. Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation and acknowledge its derivative nature from an earlier version.
