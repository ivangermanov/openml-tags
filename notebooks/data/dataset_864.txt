The Sleuth Ex dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. This conversion involves taking the numeric target feature and replacing it with a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean of the target values is calculated, and then all instances with a lower target value are classified as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all others are classified as Negative, denoted by 'N'. 

This dataset includes several features, among which are Owl, PCT Ring One, PCT Ring Two, PCT Ring Three, PCT Ring Four, PCT Ring Five, and PCT Ring Six, as well as the Binary Class.
