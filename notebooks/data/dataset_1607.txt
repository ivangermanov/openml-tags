The QSAR-TID-12703 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12703. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features, representing FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this source when using the dataset. The features do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes multiple molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the structural properties of molecules. These fingerprints are used in machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The drug target in question is Tryptase beta-1, also known as TPS1, TPS2, TPSAB1, or TPSB1. It is an enzyme that belongs to the serine protease family and plays a crucial role in various biological processes.

Tryptase beta-1 is involved in proteolysis, defense responses, and extracellular matrix disassembly. It is also associated with various diseases and conditions, making it an important target for drug discovery and development.
