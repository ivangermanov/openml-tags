Football Expected Goals Match Statistics

Tags: Context

In recent years, statisticians and data scientists have been trying to come up with new ways to evaluate team performance in football. Sometimes a result is not a fair reflection on a team's performance, and this is where expected goals come in. Expected goals is a relatively new football metric, using the quality of passing and goal-scoring opportunities to rank a team's performance. Understat.com provides these statistics by using neural networks to approximate this data, and I have therefore scraped statistics for matches played between seasons to provide the following dataset.

The leagues included in this representation are the English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, and Russian Football Premier League.

The dataset contains twenty-two columns, many of which will be self-explanatory, such as date, home team, and so on. Some of the less common features will be outlined below:

Chance refers to the percentage prediction of an outcome based on expected goals. Expected Goals is the number of goals a team is expected to score based on performance. Deep refers to the number of passes completed within an estimated twenty yards from goal. PPDA stands for the number of passes allowed per defensive action in the opposition half. Expected Points is the number of points a team is expected to achieve in this game.

Inspiration

Is the expected goals feature an accurate representation of a team's performance? How can this feature be improved? Can we predict the outcome of future games based on previous games?
