Football Expected Goals Match Statistics

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Context

In recent years, statisticians and data scientists have been striving to develop innovative methods to assess team performance in football. Occasionally, a match result may not accurately reflect a team's overall performance, and this is where expected goals come into play. Expected goals is a relatively novel football metric that utilizes the quality of passing and goal-scoring opportunities to rank a team's performance.

Understat.com employs neural networks to estimate this data, and subsequently, I have compiled statistics for matches played between two specific seasons. The leagues incorporated in this representation include the English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, and the Russian Football Premier League.

The dataset comprises twenty-two columns, many of which are self-explanatory, such as date and home team. However, some less familiar features are outlined below:

Chance represents the percentage prediction of an outcome based on expected goals. Expected Goals denotes the number of goals a team is anticipated to score based on their performance. Deep signifies the number of passes completed within an estimated twenty yards from the goal. PPDA stands for the number of passes allowed per defensive action in the opposition half. Expected Points represents the number of points a team is anticipated to achieve in this particular game.

Is the expected goals feature a precise representation of a team's performance? How can this feature be refined? Can we forecast the outcome of forthcoming games based on preceding games?
