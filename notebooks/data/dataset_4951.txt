Mildew Bayesian Network Sample 10.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, while the average degree is around two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network was designed to model the influence diagram for management of mildew in winter wheat.

Features include micro climate, leaf area index, photos, and various measures of temperature, radiation, and precipitation.
