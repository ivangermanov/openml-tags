Experiment Data Obtained by Running Random Configurations of Decision Trees Through Machine Learning Framework on Diverse Classification Tasks 

This experiment involves running multiple iterations of decision trees using random configurations through a machine learning framework on a diverse range of one hundred fifteen different classification tasks sourced from OpenML. 

Features characterizing these experiments include task identification, dataset information, learner attributes, mean misclassification error, log loss performance metrics, training time duration, prediction time duration, number of imputed selected control parameters for optimization, complexity parameter values, maximum tree depth constraints, minimum bucket size requirements, and minimum split criteria.

Keywords: Decision Trees, Machine Learning Framework, OpenML, Classification Tasks, Random Configurations, Performance Metrics.
