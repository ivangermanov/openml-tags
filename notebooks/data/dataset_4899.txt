Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

The Alarm Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network consists of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with five hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, while the average degree is roughly two point four nine. The maximum in-degree is four.

This network was designed to model the Alarm monitoring system, which is a case study that demonstrates the application of probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks.

The network features various variables related to patient care, including patient history, physiological measurements, and medical interventions. These variables interact with each other in complex ways, requiring probabilistic modeling to capture their relationships.

The Alarm network has been widely used as a benchmark for evaluating probabilistic inference algorithms and machine learning models.
