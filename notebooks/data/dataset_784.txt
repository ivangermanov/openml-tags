The Newton Hema dataset has been binarized, converting its numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset encompasses various features, including Identification and Weeks.
