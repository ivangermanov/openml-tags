Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: identification, weeks, cells percentage, binary class

This dataset, known as Newton Hema, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified two-class classification problem. The process involved calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This transformation allows for easier analysis and application of binary classification algorithms. The dataset includes features such as identification numbers, duration in weeks, percentage of cells, and the newly created binary class designation. Researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems or mythbusting studies may find this dataset particularly useful for their work.
