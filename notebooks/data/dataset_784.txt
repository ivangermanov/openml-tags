This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification results in a binary class feature. The dataset consists of various chemical properties, which are crucial in understanding the underlying relationships between different chemical compounds.

Features: Oxygen One, Oxygen Two, Oxygen Three, Oxygen Four, Oxygen Five, Oxygen Six, Oxygen Seven, Oxygen Eight, Oxygen Nine, Oxygen Ten, Binary Class.
