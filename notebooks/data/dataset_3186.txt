MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-100120

Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Statistics, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred twelve zero, and it has eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

The features represent fingerprints six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings they were obtained using the pipeline pilot program dassault systemes biobia generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and many fingerprint features.
