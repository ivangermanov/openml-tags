New York City Citywide Payroll Data
Tags: This dataset is now updated annually.

This dataset contains the salary, pay rate, and total compensation of every New York City employee. It provides a transparent lens into who gets paid how much and for what. The information is provided for multiple fiscal years, and provides a comprehensive view of the compensation of all City of New York employees during that period.

Note that fiscal years in the New York City budget cycle start on July first and end on June thirtieth. This means that this dataset contains compensation information for all City of New York employees for a specific period of time.

This dataset provides columns for fiscal year, employee name, the city department they work for, their job title, and various fields describing their compensation. The most important of these fields is Regular Gross Pay, which provides that employee's total compensation.

This information was published as-is by the City of New York.

This dataset can be used to answer a variety of questions, such as how many people do the various city agencies employ, and how much does each department spend on salary in total? What are the most numerous job titles in civic government employment? Where does overtime pay seem to be especially common? How much of it is there? How do New York City employee salaries compare against salaries of city employees in other cities? Is the difference more or less than the difference in cost of living between the two cities?
