The Boston dataset is a binarized regression problem in the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is a modified version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset consists of various features, including Crime Rate, Proportion of Residential Land Zoned, Proportion of Non-Retail Business Acres, Charles River Dummy Variable, Nitric Oxides Concentration, Average Number of Rooms per Dwelling, Age of Owner-Occupied Units, Weighted Distances to Five Boston Employment Centers, Index of Accessibility to Radial Highways, Full-Value Property-Tax Rate, Pupil-Teacher Ratio, Proportion of Black Population, Lower Status of Population, and Binary Class.
