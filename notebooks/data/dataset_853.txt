Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of the original Boston housing dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involves calculating the mean of the target variable and subsequently categorizing instances into two classes based on their relation to this mean value. Instances with target values below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are labeled as negative.

The dataset retains the original features from the Boston housing dataset, which include various socio-economic and environmental factors related to housing in Boston. These features provide a comprehensive view of the characteristics that may influence housing prices and neighborhood desirability.

This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for binary classification tasks, allowing researchers and data scientists to explore machine learning algorithms and techniques in a simplified context. It serves as a valuable resource for studies in data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling within the domain of urban housing markets.
