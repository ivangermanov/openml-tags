The Meta Album Boats Dataset is a collection of images featuring various types of maritime vessels in their natural environments. This dataset is derived from the original Marvel dataset, which contains over 138,000 images of twenty-six different boat classes. To preprocess these images, the top and bottom three rows or the left and right three columns were duplicated based on the original image's orientation, resulting in square images. These square images were then resized to 128x128 pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.

**Dataset Details**

The Meta Album Boats Dataset consists of twenty classes with eight hundred images in total. The images are 128x128 pixels in size and are available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license.
