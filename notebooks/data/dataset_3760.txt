Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three
This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 117. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains information about Somatostatin Receptor Two, which is a single protein preferred name, also known as Somatostatin Receptor Type Two, SRIF-One, SS Two R, and SS-Two-R. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor family A GPCR, and short peptide receptor family A GPCR.

Somatostatin Receptor Two is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, spermatogenesis, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, cerebellum development, forebrain development, and somatostatin signaling pathway.

The dataset also includes information about various molecules that interact with Somatostatin Receptor Two, such as Vapreotide, Pasireotide, Velatoreotide, Lanreotide, and Paltusotine. These molecules have different mechanisms of action and have been used in different phases of clinical trials.
