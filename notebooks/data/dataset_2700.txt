FOREX Euro/Swedish Krona Hourly High Dataset

Tags: Agriculture, Economics, Finance, Forex, Forex High, Forex Hour

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex Euro/Swedish Krona exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one hourly candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January to December and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent hour relative to the mean high price of the current hour. In other words, if the mean high price increases in the following hour, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.
