The Eucalyptus Dataset is a collection of data related to chemistry and life science studies. This binarized version of the original dataset has been modified to convert the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

Originally part of a larger study, this dataset has undergone significant changes to make it more accessible for research purposes. One notable alteration is the conversion of the target feature, which now consists of only two categories: Positive and Negative.

The dataset comprises various features, including Abbreviation, Report, Locality, Map Reference, Latitude, Altitude, Rainfall, Frosts, Year, Species, Publication Number, Diameter at Breast Height, Height, Survival Rate, Vigor, Insect Resistance, Stem Form, Crown Form, and Branch Form. These features provide valuable insights into the characteristics and properties of eucalyptus trees.
