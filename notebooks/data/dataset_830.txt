Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This binarization technique simplifies the original numeric target into a more straightforward two-class problem, potentially making it more suitable for certain machine learning algorithms or analysis techniques.

The dataset includes several features, labeled as "oz" followed by numbers, which may represent different measurements or attributes related to the subject matter. The final feature, "binary Class," likely represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.
