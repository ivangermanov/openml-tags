Ailerons 
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the regression on numerical features benchmark and was transformed in the same way as the other datasets in this benchmark.

The Ailerons dataset addresses a control problem, specifically flying an F sixteen aircraft. The attributes in this dataset describe the status of the airplane, and the goal is to predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft.

The dataset includes various features that describe the aircraft's state, including its climb rate, pitch, roll, and other relevant metrics. These features are used to train a model that can accurately predict the necessary control actions to maintain stable flight.
