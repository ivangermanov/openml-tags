**Kidney Dataset**
Tags: Author, Source, StatLib

The Kidney dataset contains information on the recurrence times to infection at the point of insertion of the catheter for kidney patients using portable dialysis equipment. It is worth noting that catheters may be removed for reasons other than infection, resulting in censored observations. Each patient in the dataset has exactly two observations.

This dataset has been widely used by various researchers to demonstrate random effects, also known as frailty models, for survival data. However, it is essential to acknowledge that any nonzero estimate of the random effect is largely attributed to a single outlier, specifically Subject Twenty-One.

The variables included in this dataset are Patient, Time, Status, Age, Sex, where One indicates Male and Two indicates Female, Disease Type, which includes Glomerulo Nephritis, Acute Nephritis, Polycystic Kidney Disease, and Other, and an estimate of the Frailty.
