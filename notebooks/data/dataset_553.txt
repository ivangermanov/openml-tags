Kidney Dataset

Tags: Survival Analysis, Medical Data, Dialysis Patients

This dataset contains information on the recurrence times to infection at the point of catheter insertion for kidney patients using portable dialysis equipment. Catheters may be removed for reasons other than infection, resulting in censored observations. Each patient in the study has exactly two observations recorded.

The dataset has been utilized by various researchers to demonstrate random effects models, also known as frailty models, for survival data analysis. However, it is worth noting that any non-zero estimate of the random effect is predominantly attributable to a single outlier case.

The variables included in the dataset are:
- Patient identifier
- Time to infection or censoring
- Status (infected or censored)
- Age of the patient
- Sex of the patient (male or female)
- Disease type (Glomerulo Nephritis, Acute Nephritis, Polycystic Kidney Disease, or Other)
- Researcher's estimate of the frailty

This dataset was originally sourced from StatLib and has been used in published research on survival analysis and random effects modeling in medical contexts. It provides valuable information for studying infection rates and catheter longevity in kidney patients undergoing dialysis treatment.

The data offers insights into the factors affecting catheter-related infections in dialysis patients and can be used to develop more effective treatment strategies and improve patient care in nephrology.
