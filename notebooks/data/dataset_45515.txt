This dataset contains twenty five microseconds delay and was created on twenty first September two thousand twenty two.

Attribute Descriptions:

The CCS Zero section contains attributes related to the first Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement. This includes the TCP source port, destination port, port, stream, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.

The TLS Zero section contains attributes related to the first TLS Alert. This includes the TCP source port, destination port, port, stream, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, TLS record content type, TLS record length, TLS alert message level, TLS alert message description, and message order.

The DISC Zero and DISC One sections contain attributes related to the first and second TCP Disconnect respectively. These include the TCP source port, destination port, port, stream, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.
