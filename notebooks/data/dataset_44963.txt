**Data Description**
This dataset, Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure, is comprised of forty-five thousand seven hundred thirty decoys, with sizes varying from zero to twenty-one Armstrong. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the size of the residue for a tertiary protein structure, which is a three-dimensional protein structure. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid is referred to as a residue. The target feature is the root mean square error of the residue.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset consists of nine attributes, which are described as follows:

The size of the residue is represented by Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). 
Total Surface Area is denoted by F1. 
Non-Polar Exposed Area is represented by F2. 
Fractional Area of Exposed Non-Polar Residue is denoted by F3. 
Fractional Area of Exposed Non-Polar Part of Residue is represented by F4. 
Molecular Mass Weighted Exposed Area is denoted by F5. 
Average Deviation from Standard Exposed Area of Residue is represented by F6. 
Euclidean Distance is denoted by F7. 
Secondary Structure Penalty is represented by F8. 
Spatial Distribution Constraints, which include N and K values, are denoted by F9.

**Dataset Information**
This dataset does not contain any missing values.
