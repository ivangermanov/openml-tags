Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Blood Transfusion Service Center with seed equals zero arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals True

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subset of data, categorical mask, and columns.
