This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Thirteen, and it has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains demographics and geography information related to the MetaQSAR project from September two thousand fifteen. It is essential to cite this dataset when using it for any purpose.
