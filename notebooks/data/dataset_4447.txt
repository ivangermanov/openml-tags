Subsampling of the Dataset KDD Cup Nine Appetency 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the KDD Cup Nine Appetency dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset. 

The subsampling function takes in several parameters, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. 

First, the function identifies the unique classes in the dataset and selects a specified number of them randomly. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. 

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the remaining dataset. It does this by generating a list of column indices, sorting them, and selecting a specified number of columns. 

Finally, the function stratifies the remaining data according to the target variable and samples a specified number of rows. This ensures that the resulting dataset maintains a similar class distribution to the original.
