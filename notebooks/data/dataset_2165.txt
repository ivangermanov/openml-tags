QSAR-TID-100435 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand four thirty-five, and it has twenty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.
