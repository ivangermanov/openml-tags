The Laser Generated Dataset was originally a univariate time record of a single observed quantity, carefully recorded from a Far Infrared Laser operating in a chaotic state. The original dataset consisted of a large number of points, which have since been adapted for regression analysis purposes. Specifically, every set of four consecutive values have been considered as inputs, and the subsequent value as an output. To ensure data quality, duplicated instances have been removed.

Features: Four Consecutive Inputs, Next Value Output
