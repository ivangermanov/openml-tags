Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Upselling

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling.

The function first selects a subset of classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed. It does this by randomly selecting column indices and sorting them to ensure consistency.

If the number of rows still exceeds the maximum allowed, the function stratifies the data and samples a subset of rows. This is done using a train-test split function, which ensures that the sampled data maintains the same class distribution as the original data.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to strings and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
