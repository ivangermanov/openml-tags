QSAR-TID-12828 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12828. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12828. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists who want to study the activity of compounds on drug target TID: 12828.

The dataset contains a single protein, which is Cyclin-dependent Kinase Three. This protein is also known as CDK Three, CDKN Three, Cell Division Protein Kinase Three, and Cyclin-dependent Kinase Three. It is a protein that belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase CDK family/CMGC protein kinase CDC Two subfamily.

The dataset is related to the organism Homo sapiens, which is a species group. The protein target classification is One, Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase CDK family/CMGC protein kinase CDC Two subfamily.
