QSAR-TID-12828 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12828. It has eighty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains information about the compound's molecule ChEMBL ID, and its corresponding median pXC fifty value.

Demographic information about the dataset includes the number of rows and features, as well as the type of molecular fingerprints used.

This dataset is particularly useful for researchers studying the relationship between chemical structures and their biological activities.
