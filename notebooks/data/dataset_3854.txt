The QSAR-TID-11262 dataset, tagged with MTLQSAR and study_3, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11262. This dataset has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

The features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features, which do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset contains information about the Somatostatin Receptor three, also known as Smstr three, which is a single protein and a preferred name. It is a synonym for Somatostatin Receptor type three, SS three R, SS-three-R, and SS three-R. This receptor is found in the species Mus musculus, and its protein target classification is one point Membrane Receptor, Family A G-Protein Coupled Receptor, Peptide Receptor, and Short Peptide Receptor.

The description of this receptor includes its relationship and accession number, which is P three zero nine thirty-five. It is a component of multiple cellular components, including plasma membrane, cilium, membrane, neuron projection, ciliary membrane, and non-motile cilium. Its functions include G-Protein Coupled Receptor activity, Somatostatin Receptor activity, Signaling Receptor binding, and Neuropeptide binding. It is involved in multiple biological processes, including signal transduction, G-Protein Coupled Receptor signaling pathway, Neuropeptide signaling pathway, spermatogenesis, cerebellum development, forebrain development, Somatostatin signaling pathway, response to starvation, cellular response to Glucocorticoid stimulus, and cellular response to Estradiol stimulus.
