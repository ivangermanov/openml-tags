QSAR-TID-11262 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Somatostatin Receptor Three, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Somatostatin Receptor Three. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX Fifty.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
