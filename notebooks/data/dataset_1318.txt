QSAR-TID-10075 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. The dataset has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset provides information about a specific drug target, renal dipeptidase, also known as beta-lactamase dipeptidase one. It belongs to the metallo protease M nineteen family and is classified as an enzyme/protease/metallo protease. 

This protein is located in various cellular components, including the extracellular space, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, plasma membrane, and microvillus membrane. It is involved in multiple biological processes, such as proteolysis, lipid metabolic process, leukotriene metabolic process, glutathione catabolic process, antibiotic metabolic process, and cellular response to insulin stimulus.

Renal dipeptidase has multiple functions, including peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, beta-lactamase activity, hydrolase activity, dipeptidase activity, GPI anchor binding, identical protein binding, cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity involved in apoptotic process, metal ion binding, metallodipeptidase activity, and modified amino acid binding.
