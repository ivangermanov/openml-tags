QSAR-TID-10928 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10928. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10928. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. The dataset should be cited as MetaQSAR project - September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains information about the Urotensin II receptor, which is a single protein and a G-protein coupled receptor. It is also known as Gpr fourteen and is a peptide receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway.

The receptor is also involved in the regulation of blood pressure, glomerular filtration, and urine volume. It is also involved in the positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, cell growth, angiogenesis, and vasoconstriction.

The dataset contains information about the receptor's function, including its activity, and its involvement in various biological processes. The dataset also contains information about the receptor's structure, including its membrane receptor and peptide receptor properties.
