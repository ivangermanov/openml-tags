This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand nine hundred twenty-eight, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent Fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, among others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited accordingly.
