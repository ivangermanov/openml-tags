The ACSIncome dataset is one of five datasets created as an improved alternative to the popular UCI Adult dataset. The data was compiled from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample. Data is provided for all fifty states and for Puerto Rico. This upload represents the raw data from a specific year. The data contains a large number of rows, a moderate number of features, and one target variable. An additional column for the state code is provided for convenience. All columns are described in the original publication as well as in the Public Use Microdata Sample Data Dictionary. Additional detail can also be found on the dataset's GitHub repository.

The dataset features include Age, Class of Worker, Educational Attainment, Marital Status, Occupation, Place of Birth, Relationship, Hours Worked per Week, Sex, and Race.
