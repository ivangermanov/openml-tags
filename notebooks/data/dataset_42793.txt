Name: Olinda Outliers
Tags: Outliers Data Set Extracted from the Illustration in Novelty Detection with Application to Data Streams
Features: Coordinate Zero, Coordinate One, Label

This dataset, known as Olinda Outliers, is a collection of data points extracted from an illustration in a research paper focused on novelty detection and its application to data streams. The dataset consists of two main features, namely Coordinate Zero and Coordinate One, which are used to identify and analyze outliers in the data. Each data point is also assigned a label, which indicates whether it is an outlier or not.
