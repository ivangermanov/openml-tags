The dataset consists of two hundred subjects from a larger study on the survival of patients following admission to an Adult Intensive Care Unit. This study utilized logistic regression to predict the probability of survival for these patients until their discharge from the hospital. The dependent variable is the binary variable Vital Status. Nineteen possible predictor variables, both discrete and continuous, were also observed.

Description: 
The data includes nineteen possible predictor variables, which include the patient's demographics, medical history, and physiological measurements. These variables aim to help predict the patient's vital status upon discharge from the hospital.

Variables:
The dataset includes the following variables: Identification Number, Vital Status, Age, Sex, Race, Service at ICU Admission, Cancer Diagnosis, Chronic Renal Failure, Infection, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, Systolic Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Previous Illnesses, Type of Admission, Fraction of Inspired Oxygen, Partial Pressure of Oxygen, pH Level, Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide, Bicarbonate Level, Creatinine Level, and Glasgow Coma Scale Score.
