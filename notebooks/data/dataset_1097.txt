Description: The data consist of subjects from a larger study on the survival of patients following admission to an adult intensive care unit (ICU). The study employed logistic regression to predict the probability of survival for these patients until their discharge from the hospital. The dependent variable is the binary variable Vital Status (STA). Nineteen possible predictor variables, both discrete and continuous, were also observed.

Variable Names:
ID: ID number of the patient
STA: Vital status (Lived or Died)
AGE: Patient's age in years
SEX: Patient's sex (Male or Female)
RACE: Patient's race (White, Black, or Other)
SER: Service at ICU admission (Medical or Surgical)
CAN: Is cancer part of the present problem? (Yes or No)
CRN: History of chronic renal failure (Yes or No)
INF: Infection probable at ICU admission (Yes or No)
CPR: CPR prior to ICU admission (Yes or No)
SYS: Systolic blood pressure at ICU admission
HRA: Heart rate at ICU admission
PRE: Previous admission to an ICU within six months (Yes or No)
TYP: Type of admission (Elective or Emergency)
FRA: Long bone, multiple, neck, single area, or hip fracture (Yes or No)
PO2: PO2 from initial blood gases
PH: PH from initial blood gases
PCO: PCO2 from initial blood gases
BIC: Bicarbonate from initial blood gases
CRE: Creatinine from initial blood gases
LOC: Level of consciousness at ICU admission
