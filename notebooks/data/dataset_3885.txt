QSAR-TID-12247 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12247. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has 1403 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein, Protein Kinase C Delta, is a single protein that belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase PKC family/AGC protein kinase PKC delta subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, DNA damage response, cell cycle, and signal transduction.

The protein has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, and has been targeted by various small molecule inhibitors, including Delcasertib.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Protein Kinase C Delta, and to identify potential inhibitors of this protein.
