Data Set Information:
The dataset consists of three classes of waves, each with twenty-one attributes, all of which include noise. For a detailed explanation, please refer to the book.

Attribute Information:
Each class is generated from a combination of two of three base waves. Each instance is generated with added noise, having a mean of zero and a variance of one, in each attribute. For further information, please see the book.

Relevant Papers:
Classification and Regression Trees.

Citation Policy:
Please refer to the Machine Learning Repository's citation policy.

Features: 
The dataset includes twenty-one attributes, including various waveform characteristics.
