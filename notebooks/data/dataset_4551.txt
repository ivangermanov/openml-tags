Waveform Database Generator

Tags: Abstract

This dataset is based on the waveform domains described in the book Classification and Regression Trees.

Source: Original

The dataset is a collection of waveform data with three classes of waves, each generated from a combination of two of three base waves. Each instance is generated by adding noise with a mean of zero and a variance of one in each attribute.

Data Set Information:

The dataset contains twenty-one attributes, all of which include noise. For more details, please refer to the book Classification and Regression Trees.

Attribute Information:

Each class of waves is generated from a combination of two of three base waves. Each instance is generated by adding noise with a mean of zero and a variance of one in each attribute.
