bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 
This network has characteristics such as the number of nodes and arcs, which define its structure, as well as the number of parameters, which determine its complexity.

The average Markov blanket size and average degree provide insight into the network's connectivity, while the maximum in-degree highlights the most connected node.
