QSAR-TID-19907 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19907. The dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19907. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecules as a series of bits.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The target is a calcium-dependent protein kinase, which is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in many cellular processes.

The dataset also contains information about the target's function, including its role in protein phosphorylation and phosphorylation. Additionally, the dataset provides information about the target's relationships with other proteins and its accession numbers in various databases.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, calcium-dependent protein kinase, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation.
