QSAR-TID-19907 Tags: Earth Science, Meteorology, MTLQSAR, study 3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19907. It has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty. The features represent Finger Print Counting Power six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
