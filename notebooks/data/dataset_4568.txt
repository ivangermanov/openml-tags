Blood Transfusion Service Center Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Cols One Hundred Stratify True 

This dataset is a subsampling of the Blood Transfusion Service Center dataset, which has been randomly sampled using a seed value of three. The maximum number of rows has been set to two thousand, the maximum number of columns to one hundred, and the maximum number of classes to ten. 

The sampling process first involves uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the chosen classes are representative of the overall distribution. This is done to maintain the stratification of the original dataset. 

Next, the columns are sampled uniformly, selecting a specified number of columns from the total available. This is done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential characteristics. 

Finally, the rows are sampled according to the specified maximum number, again maintaining the stratification of the original dataset. This ensures that the resulting subsampled dataset remains representative of the original.
