The Weather dataset is a small collection of data that we will utilize repeatedly to demonstrate various machine learning techniques. This entirely fictional dataset supposedly revolves around the conditions deemed suitable for engaging in an unspecified outdoor activity. In general, individual instances within a dataset are characterized by the values of distinct features or attributes, which serve to measure diverse aspects of said instance.

In the context of the Weather dataset, there exist four primary attributes: the overall outlook, the prevailing temperature, the ambient humidity, and the presence or absence of wind. The ultimate outcome of interest is whether or not to engage in the aforementioned outdoor activity.
