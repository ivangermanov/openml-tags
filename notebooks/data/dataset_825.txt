Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of the original Boston housing dataset. The primary modification involves the transformation of the numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization process allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset contains various features related to housing in Boston, including geographical information, crime rates, environmental factors, and socioeconomic indicators. These features provide a comprehensive view of the factors that may influence housing prices in the area.

Researchers and data scientists can utilize this dataset for various purposes, including mythbusting studies and exploring the effectiveness of different classification algorithms on real-world data. The binary nature of the target variable makes it particularly suitable for testing and comparing binary classification models.
