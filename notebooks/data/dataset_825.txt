Binarized Regression Problem: Boston Corrected Dataset 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features such as Town, Town Identification Number, Tract, Longitude, Latitude, Median House Value, Corrected Median House Value, Crime Rate, Proportion of Residential Land Zoned for Lots Over 25,000 Square Feet, Proportion of Non-Retail Business Acres per Town, Charles River Dummy Variable, Nitric Oxide Concentration, Average Number of Rooms per Dwelling, Age of House, Weighted Distances to Five Boston Employment Centers, Index of Accessibility to Radial Highways, Full Tax Rate per $10,000, Pupil Teacher Ratio, and Binary Class.
