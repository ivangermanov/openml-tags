QSAR-TID-10477 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10477. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. 

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.
