QSAR-TID-10078 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor One, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor One. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor One is a single protein, also known as Corticotropin Releasing Hormone Receptor One, CRF-R One, CRF-R-One, CRFR-One, and other synonyms. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a family B G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. It is found in the organism Mus musculus, and is classified as a protein target.

The protein target classification is one, membrane receptor, family B G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor. The description of the protein target is Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor One.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
