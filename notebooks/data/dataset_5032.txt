**Pathfinder Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, specifically listed under discrete-very large networks.

The Pathfinder network has a large number of nodes and arcs, indicating a complex structure. It also has an average Markov blanket size and average degree, suggesting that each node has a moderate number of parents and children. However, some nodes have a higher in-degree, indicating that they are influenced by multiple factors.

This network was originally designed for use in expert systems, specifically in the field of medicine. It is intended to provide a normative framework for decision-making in this domain.

Features include fault diagnosis, patient symptoms, medical test results, and other relevant factors.
