Credit Seed One Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the credit dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes were present in the resulting dataset. The number of classes was limited to ten, and the classes were chosen based on their frequency in the original dataset.

The columns of the dataset were also uniformly sampled, with a maximum of one hundred columns selected. The selection of columns was done randomly, but the resulting columns were sorted in ascending order.

The number of rows in the dataset was limited to two thousand, and the stratification of the data was done based on the target variable. This ensured that the resulting dataset had a balanced distribution of classes.

The features of this dataset include Revolving Utilization of Unsecured Lines, Age, Debt Ratio, Monthly Income, Number of Open Credit Lines and Loans, and Number of Dependents.
