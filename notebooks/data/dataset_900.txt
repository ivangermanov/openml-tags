Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: column one, column two, column three, column four, column five, column six, binary class

This dataset is a modified version of an original census dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value falls below or above this mean, respectively. Positive instances are labeled with 'P', while negative instances are labeled with 'N'. This binarization allows for simplified two class analysis and modeling.

The dataset retains six original columns from the census data, likely containing demographic and socioeconomic information, though the specific contents of these columns are not detailed. An additional column, labeled as binary class, has been added to represent the newly created binary target feature.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The binary classification approach may be particularly useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that require a clear positive/negative distinction.
