Alarm Bayesian Network Sample Eight. This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which provides a comprehensive collection of Bayesian networks for research and development.

The Alarm network consists of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in five hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, while the average degree is two point four nine. The maximum in-degree of this network is four.

This Bayesian network was designed to model the Alarm monitoring system, which is a real-world application used in medical settings. It demonstrates the power of probabilistic inference techniques in belief networks, highlighting their potential in artificial intelligence and medicine.
