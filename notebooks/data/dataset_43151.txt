**Asia Dataset**
**Tags:** Dataset

**Dataset Description**
The Asia dataset is a synthetic dataset that explores the relationships between lung diseases, such as tuberculosis, lung cancer, or bronchitis, and visits to Asia. This dataset is particularly useful for demonstrating probabilistic graphical models and their applications in expert systems.

**Format of the Dataset**
The dataset is a data frame consisting of five thousand rows and eight binary variables. Each variable is represented by a binary value of zero or one, corresponding to "no" and "yes" respectively.

**Variables**
The dataset includes the following variables: Visit to Asia, Smoking, Tuberculosis, Lung Cancer, Bronchitis, Chest X-ray, Dyspnoea, and Tuberculosis versus Lung Cancer or Bronchitis.

**Source**
The Asia dataset is available at the Bayesian Network Repository.

**References**
The dataset is based on a research paper that discusses local computation with probabilities on graphical structures and their application to expert systems.

**Features**
The dataset includes variables related to lung diseases, visits to Asia, and other relevant factors.
