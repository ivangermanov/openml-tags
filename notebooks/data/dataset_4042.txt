QSAR-TID-12536 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12536. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has two hundred and two rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein is Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase p38 Alpha, also known as MAP Kinase p38 Alpha, which is a protein kinase that plays a key role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, gene expression, and cell proliferation.

The protein is involved in several biological processes, including DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. It is also implicated in various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening to identify potential inhibitors of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase p38 Alpha.
