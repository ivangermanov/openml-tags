This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information about Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, which is a single protein preferred name. It also has synonyms such as ACE, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, soluble form, CD antigen equals CD one forty-three, DCP one, and others.

Organism information is also included, specifically Oryctolagus cuniculus species group. Additionally, there is classification information available, specifically enzyme, protease, metallo protease, MAE clan, metallo protease M two family.

Description relationship accession is available for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme as a single protein. There are multiple go components including extracellular region, extracellular space, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and membrane.

Go function information is also available, including carboxypeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, calmodulin binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, peptidyl-dipeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, chloride ion binding, metal ion binding, metallodipeptidase activity.

Furthermore, go process information is included, covering topics such as kidney development, angiotensin maturation, proteolysis, regulation of blood pressure, substance P catabolic process, bradykinin catabolic process, hormone metabolic process, hormone catabolic process, regulation of synaptic plasticity.

CanSAR-target information is available, specifically P one twenty-eight twenty-two. UniProt information includes O zero two eight five two, P one twenty-eight twenty-two, P two two nine sixty-eight. InterPro information covers Peptidase M two. Pfam information covers Peptidase M two.
