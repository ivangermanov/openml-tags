This dataset is based on the Retail Dataset. Historical sales data covers a period of time from February fifth to November first. Sales and features data were merged, and weekly sales were estimated at the total store level. Only data for Store Twenty was selected.

Columns include Date, which represents the week; Temperature, which is the average temperature in the region; Fuel Price, which is the cost of fuel in the region; Markdowns One through Five, which are anonymized data related to promotional markdowns. Markdown data is only available after November of that year and is not available for all stores at all times. Any missing value is marked with Not Available. The Consumer Price Index and Unemployment Rate are also included. Is Holiday is a column that indicates whether the week is a special holiday week. Weekly Sales represents sales in the given date, or week.
