The OkCupid Stem dataset, categorized under Life Science and Machine Learning, contains user profile data for individuals residing in San Francisco. This curated dataset was obtained from a publicly available repository on GitHub, originally compiled by scraping public profiles from www.okcupid.com on June thirtieth, two thousand twelve. The dataset comprises profiles of individuals within a twenty-five-mile radius of San Francisco, who were active online within the preceding year, and had at least one profile picture.

Permission to utilize this data was granted by the president and co-founder of OkCupid, contingent upon maintaining its public availability. The target variable, job, was condensed into three distinct categories: stem, non-stem, and student. Stem occupations encompassed roles related to computer hardware and software, as well as science, technology, and engineering.

Observations featuring unemployed, retired, or unresponsive individuals, in addition to those with missing job information, were excluded from the dataset. Furthermore, the speaks variable underwent modification to convert factor labels to integers, thereby circumventing an upload-related issue.

The original dataset incorporated ten open-text variables, designated essay zero through essay nine, which have been omitted from the uploaded dataset. Additionally, the dataset features a date-time variable, last online, which may be leveraged to construct supplementary features.

Inspiration for utilizing OkCupid data to predict stem jobs stems from the book Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models.

The dataset encompasses various attributes, including age, physical build, drinking habits, drug usage, educational background, ethnic affiliation, geographic location, sexual orientation, gender, astrological sign, smoking habits, relationship status, and social class.
