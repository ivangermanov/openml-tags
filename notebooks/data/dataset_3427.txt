This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10576, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It is tagged under Economics, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR.
