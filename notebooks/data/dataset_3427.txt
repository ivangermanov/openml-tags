QSAR-TID-10576 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10576. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Serotonin 1a receptor, which is the target of the compounds in this dataset.

The Serotonin 1a receptor is a protein target that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is involved in various physiological processes, including behavioral fear response, signal transduction, and neurotransmitter receptor activity.

The receptor is also associated with several diseases and disorders, including anxiety and depression. Therefore, the development of compounds that target the Serotonin 1a receptor is an active area of research.
