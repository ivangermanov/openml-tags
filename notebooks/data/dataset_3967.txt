QSAR-TID-114 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 114. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 3490 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Adenosine A1 receptor is a single protein target, also known as Adenosine receptor A1, ADORA1. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, response to hypoxia, and regulation of respiratory gaseous exchange by nervous system process.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and kidneys, and plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including blood pressure, heart rate, and neurotransmission.

The dataset provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships of compounds binding to the Adenosine A1 receptor, which can be useful for the design and development of new therapeutic agents.
