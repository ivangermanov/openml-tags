The Solar Flare dataset is a multivariate regression dataset that focuses on health-related topics, specifically on social media. This dataset has three target variables that correspond to the frequency of three types of solar flares - common, moderate, and severe - observed within a twenty-four hour period.

There are two versions of this dataset, namely SF One and SF Two, which contain data from different years. SF One contains data from nineteen sixty-nine, while SF Two contains data from nineteen seventy-eight.

The dataset includes various features, including the Zurich class, size of the largest sunspot, distribution of sunspots, level of activity, evolution, activity from the previous day, historical complexity, whether it became historically complex, total area, area of the largest sunspot, C-class flares, M-class flares, and X-class flares.
