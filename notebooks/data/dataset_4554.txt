The Diabetes One Thirty US dataset has undergone subsampling with a specific set of parameters. This process involved generating a random sample from the original dataset using a specified seed value. The resulting dataset has a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes.

The subsampling process began by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded the maximum allowed, a selection of classes was made based on their frequency of occurrence. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the data.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled, ensuring that only the most relevant features were retained. This was done by randomly selecting a subset of column indices, which were then used to filter the data.

Finally, the dataset was further reduced by sampling a maximum of two thousand rows. This was done using stratified sampling, which ensured that the resulting dataset maintained the same class balance as the original dataset.

The features of the resulting dataset include patient information, medical history, and treatment details. These features are essential for understanding the complexities of diabetes management and predicting patient outcomes.
