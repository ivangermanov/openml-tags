QSAR-TID-12023 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12023. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12023. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The dataset is related to the Sphingosine One-Phosphate Receptor Edg-Eight, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as Endothelial Differentiation G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Eight, S One P Receptor Five, and S One P Receptor Edg-Eight. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, sphingosine-one-phosphate receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of metabolic process.
