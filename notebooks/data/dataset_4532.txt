The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. These features are the raw data collected by the detectors. The last seven features are functions of the first twenty-one features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. This would allow for a more automated and efficient process.

Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and five-layer neural networks are presented in the original paper. The last portion of the data is used as a test set.

Attribute Information: The first column is the class label, with one indicating signal and zero indicating background, followed by the twenty-eight features. These features include properties of the leptons, jets, and missing energy, as well as derived features such as masses.

For more detailed information about each feature, see the original paper.
