QSAR-TID-11947 Tags: MTLQSAR, Social Media, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11947, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was scraped from various sources including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
