Note: Derived from the covertype dataset

SYLVA is the ecology database. The task of SYLVA is to classify forest cover types. The forest cover type for thirty by thirty meter cells is obtained from US Forest Service Region Resource Information System data. It has been reduced to a two-class classification problem (classifying Ponderosa pine versus everything else).

The "agnostic learning track" data consists of input variables. Each pattern is composed of four records: two true records matching the target and two records picked at random. Thus half of the features are distracters. The "prior knowledge track" data is identical to the "agnostic learning track" data, except that the distracters are removed and the identity of the features is revealed. For that track, the forest cover original ids are revealed for training data.

Data type: non-sparse

Features include: Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Horizontal Distance To Hydrology, Vertical Distance To Hydrology, Horizontal Distance To Roadways, Hillshade at various times of day, Horizontal Distance To Fire Points, various Wilderness Areas, and numerous Soil Types.

The dataset includes training and validation sets with positive and negative examples. The data originates from the US Forest Service and has been modified for use in machine learning challenges. It provides a rich set of geographical and ecological variables for predicting forest cover types, particularly focusing on distinguishing Ponderosa pine from other types.
