The QSAR-TID-100860 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which focuses on machine learning and computational universe applications. This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100860. 

The dataset has sixty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule ChEMBL IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the C-C chemokine receptor type two, also known as CC chemokine receptor, which is a single protein found in the Mus musculus species group. 

This receptor is classified under membrane receptors, family A G-protein coupled receptors, peptide receptors, and chemokine receptors. It is expressed in various cellular components, including fibrillar centers, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membranes, external sides of plasma membranes, membranes, dendrites, neuronal cell bodies, perikarya, and perinuclear regions of cytoplasm.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, response to hypoxia, blood vessel remodeling, wound healing, inflammatory responses, immune responses, humoral immune responses, cellular defense responses, signal transduction, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, computational universe, chemokine receptor, G-protein coupled receptor, signal transduction, inflammatory response, immune response.
