**QSAR-TID-11426**
**Tags:** Health, Medicine, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11426. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has three hundred seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11426.
