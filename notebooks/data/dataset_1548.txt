QSAR-TID-11624 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 11624. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset provides information about the Caspase One enzyme, also known as Interleukin One Beta Convertase, which is a protein that belongs to the Peptidase C14 Family. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and immune response.

The Caspase One enzyme is involved in multiple cellular processes, including pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways, proteolysis, and apoptotic processes. It interacts with other proteins, such as NLRP3, AIM2, and IPAF, to form inflammasomes, which are multi-protein complexes that play a key role in the activation of inflammatory responses.

The dataset includes information about the expression of the Caspase One gene, which is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney. It also provides information about the regulation of the gene expression, including the transcriptional and post-translational modifications.

In addition, the dataset includes information about the inhibitors of the Caspase One enzyme, which are small molecules that bind to the active site of the enzyme and prevent its activity. These inhibitors have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.
