Further details concerning the book, including information on statistical software (such as sample S-PLUS/R and SAS code), are available on the associated website.

The dataset is classified as nominal, with no specific class index. Quotes, single-quotes, and backslashes have been removed, and blanks have been replaced with underscores in the original formatting.
