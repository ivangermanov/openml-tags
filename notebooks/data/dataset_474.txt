The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Fri Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is particularly useful because it generates datasets with diverse characteristics.

To generate these datasets, the Friedman function was used with five features for input. Additional features were then added to measure the effect of nonrelated features. These extra features are independent from the output. Furthermore, to test an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets were generated with five different collinearity degrees. Collinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters are varied to create diverse scenarios. The number of features ranges from a small set of five to a larger set of one hundred. Similarly, the number of samples varies from a small set of one hundred to a larger set of one thousand. Additionally, the collinearity degrees range from zero to four, with higher degrees indicating more complex relationships between features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets were generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees. Each dataset has a target attribute at the end.
