Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: east west, north south, angle, radial position, binary class

This dataset, known as Visualizing Galaxy, is a binarized adaptation of an original dataset focused on galaxy visualization. The transformation process involves converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification system. This is achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization technique allows for a simplified two-class analysis of the data.

The dataset encompasses several features related to galactic positioning and orientation, including east-west and north-south coordinates, angular measurements, and radial positioning. The final feature, binary class, represents the outcome of the binarization process, providing a straightforward positive or negative classification for each instance.

This modified dataset serves various research purposes, as indicated by its association with multiple study tags. It may be particularly useful for mythbusting exercises and comparative analyses between continuous and binary classification approaches in astronomical data.

Researchers utilizing this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, acknowledging its derivation from the original source and the binarization methodology applied.
