Dataset from the LIBSVM data repository. Preprocessing: The original Adult data set has several features, among which some are continuous and others are categorical. In this data set, continuous features are discretized into quantiles, and each quantile is represented by a binary feature. Additionally, a categorical feature with multiple categories is converted to multiple binary features. Detailed information on how each feature is converted can be found at the beginning of each file from the provided page.
