QSAR-TID-100590 Dataset 

Tags: MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred ninety. It has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo pCI Fifty. 

The features represent Extended Connectivity Circular Finger Print six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.
