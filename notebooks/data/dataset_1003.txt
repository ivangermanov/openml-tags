Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: age, sex, histologic type, degree of differentiation, bone, bone marrow, lung, pleura, peritoneum, liver, brain, skin, neck, supraclavicular, axillar, mediastinum, abdominal, binary class

This dataset, known as Primary Tumor, is a modified version of an original dataset with unknown origins. The modification process involved binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a multi-class classification problem into a binary classification task. This was achieved by designating the majority class as positive and grouping all other classes as negative. The dataset encompasses a wide range of medical features related to tumor characteristics and patient information, making it potentially valuable for research in oncology and machine learning applications in healthcare.
