The dataset was created for testing purposes. 

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of thirteen constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 

The initial dataset had around thirty variables, but for some reason, only the thirteen-dimensional version is available. Unfortunately, the list of the thirty or so variables was lost, and it is not known which thirteen variables are included in the set.

The attributes are continuous and do not have missing values. It is suggested to standardize variables for certain uses, such as with classifiers that are not scale invariant.

In a classification context, this is a well-posed problem with well-behaved class structures. This dataset is suitable for first testing of a new classifier, but it is not very challenging.
