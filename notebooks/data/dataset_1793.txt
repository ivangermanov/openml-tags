QSAR-TID-104390 Dataset: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trace Amine-Associated Receptor One, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI Fifty.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Circular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
