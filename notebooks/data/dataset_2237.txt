**QSAR-TID-30047**
**Tags:** MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30047. It has ninety-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
