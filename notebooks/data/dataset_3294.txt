This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tid 11524. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Tid 11524, which is also known as the cholecystokinin B receptor.

The cholecystokinin B receptor is a single protein that belongs to the membrane receptor family and is classified under the group one membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR cholecystokinin receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including gastric acid secretion, histamine secretion, behavioral defense response, signal transduction, and G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway. It also plays a role in positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, and positive regulation of synaptic transmission.

The dataset provides information about the expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process of the receptor. It also includes data from various sources, such as expression atlas, go, reactome, uniprot, and interpro.
