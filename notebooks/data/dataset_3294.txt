QSAR-TID-11524 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11524. The dataset has 605 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a set of numerical values. These fingerprints can be used to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a valuable resource for identifying potential lead compounds and optimizing their activity.

Scraped Data:

The Cholecystokinin B receptor is a single protein target, also known as CCK2-R, Cckbr, CCK-BR, and CCK-B receptor. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including gastric acid secretion, histamine secretion, and behavioral defense response.

The receptor is expressed in the plasma membrane and is involved in signal transduction pathways, including the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and the phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
