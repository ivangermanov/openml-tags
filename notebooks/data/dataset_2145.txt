QSAR-TID-11150 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID eleven thousand one hundred fifty, and it has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, and nine hundred ninety-six more.
