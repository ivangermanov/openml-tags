Name: MFeat Factors Seed Three

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset MFeat Factors with seed equals three

This dataset is a subsample of the original MFeat Factors dataset. It was generated using a specific source code that involves uniform sampling of classes and columns, as well as stratified sampling of rows.

The subsample was created by first uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded a certain maximum, the classes were selected based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to subset the original data.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled if the number of columns exceeded a certain maximum. The selected columns were then used to subset the data.

Finally, the rows were stratified sampled based on the target variable. This involved concatenating the data and target variable, and then using a train-test split function to select a subset of the data.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including attributes one, five, six, eight, eleven, twelve, thirteen, sixteen, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-six, twenty-nine, thirty-three, thirty-five, thirty-nine, forty-two, forty-three, forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven, forty-nine, fifty-two, fifty-four, fifty-six, fifty-seven, sixty, sixty-two, sixty-three, sixty-seven, sixty-nine, seventy-three, seventy-seven, eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-nine, ninety-two, ninety-four, ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred, one hundred seven, one hundred eight, one hundred eleven, one hundred twelve, one hundred fourteen, one hundred eighteen, one hundred nineteen, one hundred twenty-one, one hundred twenty-four, one hundred twenty-five, one hundred twenty-seven, one hundred twenty-eight, one hundred thirty-two, one hundred thirty-four, one hundred thirty-five, one hundred thirty-eight, one hundred forty, one hundred forty-one, one hundred forty-two, one hundred forty-three, one hundred forty-eight, one hundred forty-nine, one hundred fifty, one hundred fifty-two, one hundred fifty-four, one hundred fifty-five, one hundred fifty-six, one hundred fifty-seven, one hundred fifty-eight, one hundred sixty-one, one hundred sixty-two, one hundred sixty-five, one hundred sixty-eight, one hundred seventy, one hundred seventy-two, one hundred seventy-seven, one hundred seventy-nine, one hundred eighty-one, one hundred eighty-two, one hundred eighty-three, one hundred eighty-five, one hundred eighty-eight, one hundred ninety-three, one hundred ninety-six, one hundred ninety-nine, two hundred, two hundred one, two hundred three, two hundred four, two hundred seven, two hundred ten, two hundred twelve, two hundred fourteen, two hundred fifteen.
