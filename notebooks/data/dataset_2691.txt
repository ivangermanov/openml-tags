This dataset consists of historical price data of the Forex aud/jpy pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the subsequent minute, relative to the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is increasing in the subsequent minute, and false when the mean high price is decreasing or remains unchanged.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only, and realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of close attributes, which are also available.
