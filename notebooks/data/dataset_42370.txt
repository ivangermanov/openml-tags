**Yacht Hydrodynamics Dataset**

Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of great value for evaluating the ship's performance and for estimating the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity. The Delft data set comprises full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose. These experiments include different hull forms, derived from a parent form closely related to the Standfast 43.

**Data Set Information**

The data set is comprised of experiments, which were performed to predict the residuary resistance of sailing yachts. The experiments include different hull forms, which were derived from a parent form. The data set is essential for evaluating the ship's performance and for estimating the required propulsive power.

**Attribute Information**

The data set includes variations in hull geometry coefficients and the Froude number. The hull geometry coefficients include the longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, prismatic coefficient, length-displacement ratio, beam-draught ratio, and length-beam ratio. The Froude number is also included. The measured variable is the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement.

**Scraped Data**

The data set includes the following features: longitudinal position, prismatic coefficient, length-displacement ratio, beam-draught ratio, length-beam ratio, Froude number, and residuary resistance.
