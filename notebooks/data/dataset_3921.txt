QSAR-TID-17121 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID seventeen thousand one hundred twenty-one, and it has a total of one hundred eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The features of the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing the chemical structure of a molecule as a binary string. This allows for the comparison and analysis of different molecules based on their structural properties. The use of molecular fingerprints has become a popular approach in QSAR modeling, as it enables the development of predictive models that can accurately predict the activity of compounds on a given drug target.
