Rainfall in Kerala 1901-2017 
Tags: Context 

Kerala is a state in South India renowned for its stunning beaches and serene backwaters. It is also affectionately referred to as God's Own Country, a title bestowed upon it by National Geographic, which named it one of the ten paradises of the world. However, due to the devastating effects of climate change, Kerala has been plagued by unprecedented rainfall and floods in recent years. In an effort to better comprehend these trends, this dataset was obtained from the Indian government's open data initiative.
