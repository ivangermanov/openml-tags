This dataset, named QSAR-TID-17121, is tagged with Economics, MTLQSAR, and study three. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dated September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on a specific drug target. There are one hundred eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset is comprised of a molecule ID feature, followed by numerous molecular fingerprint features. 

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug target, MetaQSAR, Economics.
