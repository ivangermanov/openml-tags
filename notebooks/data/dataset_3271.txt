The Burst Header Packet Flooding Attack on Optical Burst Switching Network dataset is a collection of data aimed at addressing one of the primary challenges in identifying the risks of Burst Header Packet flood attacks in Optical Burst Switching networks, namely the scarcity of reliable historical data.

### Attribute Information:

The dataset consists of attributes that provide insight into various aspects of the network, including the performance of individual nodes and the overall network behavior.

The Node attribute represents the identification number of the sending node.

Utilized Bandwidth Rate is a normalized measure of the used bandwidth.

Packet Drop Rate is a normalized measure of the percentage of lost packets.

Reserved Bandwidth refers to the initial bandwidth allocated to each node, which is determined by the user during experiments.

Average Delay Time Per Second measures the average delay time for each node, also known as end-to-end delay.

Percentage Of Lost Packet Rate and Percentage Of Lost Byte Rate represent the percentage of packets and bytes lost for each node, respectively.

Packet Received Rate measures the total number of packets received per second for each node based on the reserved bandwidth.

Used Bandwidth and Lost Bandwidth represent the actual bandwidth used and lost by each node, respectively.

Packet Size Byte measures the size of packets in bytes, taking into account the IP header and UDP header.

Packet Transmitted, Packet Received, and Packet Lost represent the total number of packets transmitted, received, and lost per second for each node, respectively.

Transmitted Byte and Received Byte represent the total number of bytes transmitted and received per second for each node, respectively.

Ten Run Average Drop Rate, Ten Run Average Bandwidth Use, and Ten Run Delay represent the average packet drop rate, bandwidth utilization, and delay time over ten consecutive iterations, respectively.

Node Status is an initial classification of nodes based on packet drop rate, used bandwidth, and average delay time, categorized as Behaving, Not Behaving, or Potentially Not Behaving.

Flood Status measures the percentage of flood per node based on packet drop rate, indicating medium and high levels of Burst Header Packet flood attack.

Class represents the final classification of nodes based on packet drop rate, reserved bandwidth, iteration number, used bandwidth, and packet drop rate.
