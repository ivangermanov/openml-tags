QSAR-TID-12169 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12169. The dataset has sixty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12169. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Neuropeptide Y receptor type five, which is a single protein target.

The Neuropeptide Y receptor type five is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including peptide YY receptor activity, pancreatic polypeptide receptor activity, and G protein-coupled receptor activity. It is also involved in several signaling pathways, including the neuropeptide signaling pathway and the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and Reactome. It contains information on the protein target, including its synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. It also contains information on the gene ontology, including biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions.
