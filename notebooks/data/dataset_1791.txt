The QSAR-TID-12665 dataset is a collection of QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12665. It contains nine hundred ninety-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this source when using the dataset.

The protein target classification is enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase PKC family/AGC protein kinase PKC delta subfamily. The preferred name is protein kinase C theta, also known as nPKC-theta, PRKCQ, and PRKCT.

The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification. The description relationship accession is protein kinase C theta type single protein Q zero four seven five nine.

There are various synonyms for the target, including protein kinase C, PKC, classical/novel, and protein kinase C, PKC. The expression atlas shows one entry, and the go component includes immunological synapse, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, membrane, aggresome, and centriolar satellite.

The go function consists of nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein kinase C activity, calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding.

The go process involves regulation of cell growth, immune system process, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis, inflammatory response, axon guidance, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, positive regulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase, and many others.

Keywords: QSAR, protein kinase C theta, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, AGC protein kinase group.
