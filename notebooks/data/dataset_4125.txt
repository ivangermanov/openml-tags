QSAR-TID-11784 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11784. 

The dataset has sixty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.
