QSAR-TID-11784 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11784. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains sixty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ErbB1 is a single protein, also known as Egfr, and is a receptor for Epidermal Growth Factor. It is involved in various biological processes, including cell morphogenesis, liver development, and hair follicle development. It is also involved in signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and response to oxidative stress.

The receptor is expressed in various cellular components, including the Golgi membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, endosome, and plasma membrane. It is involved in various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity.

The receptor is also involved in various biological processes, including cell population proliferation, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and response to organic cyclic compound. It is also involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, response to estradiol, and positive regulation of superoxide anion generation.
