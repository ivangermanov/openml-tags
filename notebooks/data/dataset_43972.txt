Bank Marketing Dataset

This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. It is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, often requiring more than one contact to the same client to access if the product, a bank term deposit, would be subscribed.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. The dataset contains information about bank client data, including age, job type, marital status, education, and whether the client has credit in default. It also includes information about the client's average yearly balance, housing loan, and personal loan.

Additionally, the dataset contains information related to the last contact of the current campaign, such as the contact communication type, last contact day of the month, last contact month of the year, and last contact duration. Other attributes include the number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client, the number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign, and the number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client.

The outcome of the previous marketing campaign is also included, as well as the desired target, which is whether the client has subscribed a term deposit.
