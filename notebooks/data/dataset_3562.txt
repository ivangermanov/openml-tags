QSAR-TID-102733 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102733. The dataset has forty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102733. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Neuropeptide FF receptor one, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as GPR one forty-seven, G-protein coupled receptor one forty-seven, Neuropeptide FF receptor one, NPFF one, and NPFFR one. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the Neuropeptide FF receptor one and its related biological processes.
