This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero two seven three three, and it has forty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The drug target is Neuropeptide FF Receptor One, also known as GPR one four seven, a single protein preferred name, with synonyms such as G-Protein Coupled Receptor one four seven, Neuropeptide FF Receptor One, NPFF One, and NPFFR One.

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens, classified under one, Membrane Receptor, Family A, G-Protein Coupled Receptor, Peptide Receptor, Short Peptide Receptor, RF Amide Receptor.
