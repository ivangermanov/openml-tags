The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function includes five features for input, which are related to the output. Additional features are added to measure the effects of non-related features, and these added features are independent from the output.

To measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree refers to the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values include varying numbers of features, ranging from five to one hundred, with only the first five features being related to the output. The remaining features are completely random. The number of samples also varies, including one hundred, two hundred fifty, five hundred, and one thousand.

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four, indicating the level of dependence between features. For datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
