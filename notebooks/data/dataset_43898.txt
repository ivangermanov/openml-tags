The Census Income dataset is a collection of data used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars per year based on various demographic and socioeconomic factors. This dataset combines both the training and testing sets, with null values represented by "not available" instead of question marks. After removing fifty-two duplicate values, the dataset consists of several features, including the individual's age, their work class, level of education, marital status, occupation, relationship status, race, sex, capital gains, capital losses, hours worked per week, and native country. The ultimate goal is to determine whether an individual's income surpasses the Fifty Thousand Dollar mark based on these characteristics.
