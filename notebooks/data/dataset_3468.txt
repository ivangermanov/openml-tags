QSAR-TID-12738 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase 7, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase 7. Matrix Metalloproteinase 7 is a single protein, also known as Matrilysin, Matrin, Matrix Metalloproteinase Seven, MMP Seven, and MMP Seven. It is an enzyme, a protease, and a metallo protease, belonging to the Metallo protease MAM clan and Metallo protease M Ten A subfamily.

The dataset has multiple features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C Fifty. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Matrix Metalloproteinase 7 is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis, extracellular matrix disassembly, extracellular matrix organization, positive regulation of cell migration, collagen catabolic process, and membrane protein intracellular domain proteolysis. It is also involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, activation of Matrix Metalloproteinases, assembly of collagen fibrils and other multimeric structures, and extra-nuclear estrogen signaling.
