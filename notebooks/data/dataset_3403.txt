QSAR-TID-240 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma is a single protein, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group B Member Three, RARG, and RAR-gamma. It is a transcription factor and a nuclear receptor that is involved in various biological processes, including transcription regulation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening. The project is a collaborative effort to collect, curate, and share QSAR data and models for various drug targets.

The dataset contains multiple rows and features, including the molecule ChEMBL ID and the median pseudo-pCI50 value. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
