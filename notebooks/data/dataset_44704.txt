Name: Connect Four Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Connect Four with seed one, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the dataset by uniformly selecting classes and columns, and then stratifying the sample according to the target variable. The subsampling process involves several steps. First, it selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. Then, it selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. Finally, it stratifies the sample according to the target variable, ensuring that the sample is representative of the original dataset.

The function takes several arguments, including the seed for random number generation, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a flag indicating whether to stratify the sample. It returns a subsampled dataset with the specified characteristics.

Features: (omitted due to unreadability)
