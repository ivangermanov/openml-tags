The Japanese Vowels dataset records six hundred forty time series of twelve Linear Prediction Cepstrum coefficients taken from nine male speakers. The data was collected for examining a newly developed classifier for multidimensional curves, also known as multidimensional time series. Nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels, specifically the vowel sound /ae/, successively. For each utterance, with the analysis parameters described below, a twelve degree Linear Prediction Analysis was applied to obtain a discrete-time series with twelve Linear Prediction Cepstrum coefficients. This means that one utterance by a speaker forms a time series whose length is in the range seven to twenty-nine and each point of a time series is of twelve features, namely the twelve coefficients.

Similar data are available for different utterances, including /ei/, /iu/, /uo/, and /oa/, in addition to /ae/. 

This dataset has been used in previous studies, including Multidimensional Curve Classification Using Passing-Through Regions, published in Pattern Recognition Letters.

Each line represents twelve Linear Prediction Cepstrum coefficients in increasing order, separated by spaces, and corresponds to one analysis frame. Lines are organized into blocks, which are a set of seven to twenty-nine lines separated by blank lines, and correspond to a single speech utterance of /ae/ with seven to twenty-nine frames. Each speaker is a set of consecutive blocks. 

There are two files, ae.train and ae.test, which contain the training and testing datasets respectively. The training dataset contains two hundred seventy time series, while the testing dataset contains three hundred seventy time series.
