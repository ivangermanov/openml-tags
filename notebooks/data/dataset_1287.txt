The QSAR-TID-191 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values measured in pseudo-pCI50 units for various compounds targeting the drug target identified as TID: one hundred ninety-one. This dataset comprises four thousand four hundred forty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature denoted as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings utilizing the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Notably, generating fingerprints typically does not necessitate missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset originates from the MetaQSAR project, launched in September two thousand fifteen.
