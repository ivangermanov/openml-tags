The IPUMS LA Small dataset contains unweighted PUMS census data from the Los Angeles and Long Beach areas for the years 1970, 1980, and 1990. The coding schemes have been standardized by the IPUMS project to be consistent across years. The data is an unweighted 1 in 100 sample of responses from the Los Angeles Long Beach area for the specified years. Household and individual records were flattened into a single table, using all variables available for all three years. When multiple versions of a variable existed, such as for race, the most general version was used. For occupation and industry, the 1950 basis was utilized.

It's important to note that PUMS data is based on cluster samples, meaning samples are made of households or dwellings from which there may be multiple individuals. Consequently, individuals from the same household are no longer independent. This issue, along with the effects of stratification on standard errors, has been considered in previous research.

The variable "school type" appears to have different coding values across the years 1970, 1980, and 1990. Two versions of this dataset exist: a small dataset containing a 1 in 1000 sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area, formed by sampling from the large dataset; and a large dataset containing a 1 in 100 sample of the same area.

The dataset includes various features such as year, group quarters, farm status, ownership, value, rent, total family income, number of families, couples, mothers, fathers, family size, number of children, education, employment status, occupation, industry, income sources, poverty status, migration, veteran status, and transportation to work, among others.
