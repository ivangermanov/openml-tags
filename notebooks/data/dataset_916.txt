Anthracycline Taxane Chemotherapy Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

This dataset contains samples characterized by values of attributes, which represent measurements from DNA microarrays. The attributes are numeric and normalized in some way, resulting in similar distributions of attribute values as in the example data. 

The dataset has been sourced from the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge. It contains between one hundred and four hundred samples, each assigned to several classes ranging from two to ten. 

Features include variables one through one hundred, representing various measurements from DNA microarrays.
