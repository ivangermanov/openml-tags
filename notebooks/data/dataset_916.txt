This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The classification is based on the mean value, where instances below the mean are labeled as Positive and those above are labeled as Negative. This allows for a simpler analysis of the data, focusing on the distinction between these two classes rather than the nuanced variations within the original numeric values.
