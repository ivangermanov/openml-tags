The Performance Prediction Dataset contains a summary of each player, which is used to predict the target variable. The target variable signifies whether a player has a career spanning five years or more, with a value of one indicating a career of five years or more and a value of zero indicating a career shorter than five years.

Some of the features in the dataset, aside from the target variable, include the number of games played, points per game, three-point shots made, and other relevant statistics. This dataset is particularly useful in identifying the key features that contribute to predicting how long a player can maintain a successful career.

Exploratory data analysis can be employed to gain insight into the features and their relationships, which can inform the creation of a classification model to predict the target variable. By analyzing the dataset, it is possible to identify the most important features that influence a player's career longevity.

The dataset includes features such as the player's name, games played, minutes played, points per game, field goals made, field goal percentage, three-point shots made, three-point percentage, free throws made, free throw percentage, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, total rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers.
