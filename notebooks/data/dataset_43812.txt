The Performance Prediction dataset contains summaries of individual players, with the goal of predicting their career longevity based on various performance metrics. The target variable indicates whether a player has had a career spanning five years or more.

Some of the key features included in this dataset are games played, minutes played per game, points scored per game, field goals made and attempted, three-point shots made and attempted, free throws made and attempted, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers.

This dataset is particularly useful for identifying the most important factors that contribute to a player's ability to sustain a long-term career. By applying exploratory data analysis techniques, valuable insights can be gained into the relationships between these features.

A classification model can then be created to predict the target variable, enabling teams and coaches to make informed decisions about player recruitment and development.

Features include: Player Name, Games Played, Minutes Played per Game, Points Scored per Game, Field Goals Made, Field Goal Attempts, Field Goal Percentage, Three Point Shots Made, Three Point Shot Attempts, Three Point Percentage, Free Throws Made, Free Throw Attempts, Free Throw Percentage, Offensive Rebounds, Defensive Rebounds, Total Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Turnovers.
