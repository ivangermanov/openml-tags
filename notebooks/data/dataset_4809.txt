This dataset belongs to the Classification on Numerical Features benchmark. It originated from the ChaLearn Automatic Machine Learning Challenge, also known as the AutoML Challenge, which was hosted on Codalab. 

The challenge revolves around solving supervised learning tasks, specifically classification and regression problems, without any human intervention. Thirty datasets were made available, all preformatted into fixed-length numerical feature representations. 

The difficulty lies in the broad diversity of data types and distributions, encompassing balanced or unbalanced classes, sparse or dense feature representations, with or without missing values or categorical variables, and varying evaluation metrics. 

The problems were drawn from an array of domains, including medical diagnosis from laboratory analyses, speech recognition, credit rating, prediction of drug toxicity or efficacy, text classification, customer satisfaction prediction, object recognition, protein structure prediction, and action recognition in video data.

While existing machine learning toolkits can solve these problems, finding the optimal combination of methods and hyperparameter settings for a specific dataset, task, evaluation metric, and computational time requires significant human effort.

The challenge aims to eliminate this human effort by creating a perfect black box solution. Code submissions would be executed automatically on the challenge's servers to train and test learning machines on unknown datasets. 

However, participants were not obligated to submit code; half of the prizes could be won by simply submitting prediction results. The challenge consisted of six rounds, with progressively difficult datasets introduced in each round. 

There was no prerequisite to participate in previous rounds to enter a new round. The rounds alternated between AutoML phases, where submitted code was blind-tested on new datasets, and Tweakathon phases, allowing participants to refine their methods on the newly released datasets.

This dataset corresponds to one of the challenge's datasets.
