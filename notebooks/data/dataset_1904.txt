This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Casein Kinase I Gamma 2, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

This dataset provides information about Casein Kinase I Gamma 2, which is a single protein and its preferred name is Casein Kinase I Isoform Gamma 2. It also has synonyms such as Casein Kinase I Isoform Gamma-2, CK1G2, CKI-gamma 2, and CSNK1G2.

Casein Kinase I Gamma 2 is an enzyme, a kinase, and a protein kinase that belongs to the CK1 protein kinase group and CK1 protein kinase family. It is found in humans and its species group is Homo sapiens.

This protein is involved in various biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, endocytosis, signal transduction, Wnt signaling pathway, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, sphingolipid biosynthetic process, and positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

It is also associated with cellular components such as nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, cell cortex, and membrane.
