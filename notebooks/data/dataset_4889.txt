The Prostate dataset is a collection of one hundred two instances related to life science and machine learning, specifically focused on microarray analysis.

This dataset explores gene expression correlates of clinical prostate cancer behavior, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease.

Features of this dataset include various probe sets, such as those related to murine interleukins, biocontrol probes, and housekeeping genes. Additionally, there are probe sets corresponding to human genes involved in cellular processes like cell growth, differentiation, and signaling pathways.

Gene expression profiles were obtained using microarray technology, which enabled the simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes. This approach allowed researchers to identify patterns and correlations between gene expression levels and clinical outcomes in prostate cancer patients.

By analyzing these data, scientists can gain a better understanding of the biological processes driving prostate cancer progression and develop new strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
