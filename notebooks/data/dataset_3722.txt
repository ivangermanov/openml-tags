QSAR-TID-30003 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30003. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 778 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PLK4, also known as Polo-Like Kinase 4, SAK, or Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase 18. It is a single protein and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/Other protein kinase group/Other protein kinase PLK family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, centriole replication, phosphorylation, positive regulation of centriole replication, cilium assembly, trophoblast giant cell differentiation, and de novo centriole assembly involved in multi-ciliated epithelial cell differentiation.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, nucleolus, cytoplasm, centrosome, centriole, microtubule organizing center, cytosol, and cytoskeleton.

The protein has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and identical protein binding.

Keywords: QSAR, PLK4, protein kinase, centriole replication, phosphorylation, cilium assembly.
