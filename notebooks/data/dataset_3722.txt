Context 
I built this dataset on Kaggle, updating the scraper to fetch fresh data.

Content 
This dataset contains all wine reviews from Wine Magazine's website, covering the years from twenty seventeen to twenty twenty. I have removed duplicates and parsed the vintage information from the title. Non-vintage wines are marked as NV.

Acknowledgments 
Thanks to the original creators of the dataset.

Features 
This dataset includes information about the country of origin, a detailed description of the wine, its designation, points awarded, price, province, region, tasting notes, and more.
