Life Science Dataset: QSAR-TID-30003 

Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30003. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30003. The dataset has numerous features, including molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The molecular fingerprints were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015.
