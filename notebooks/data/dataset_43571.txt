Wine Dataset Tags: 

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of thirteen constituents found in each of the three types of wines. I think that the initial data set had around thirty variables, but for some reason I only have the thirteen-dimensional version. I had a list of what the thirty or so variables were, but unfortunately, I lost it, and even if I had it, I would not know which thirteen variables are included in the set.

The attributes are: alcohol, malic acid, ash, alcalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, and proline. 

In a classification context, this is a well-posed problem with well-behaved class structures. A good data set for first testing of a new classifier, but not very challenging.
