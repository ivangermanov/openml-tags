QSAR-TID-252 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 252. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 4081 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The Adenosine A2a receptor is a single protein target, also known as Adenosine receptor A2a or ADORA2. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and response to stimulus.

The receptor is expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including locomotory behavior, eating behavior, and sleep. It is also involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability.

The dataset provides information on the activity of various compounds on the Adenosine A2a receptor, which can be used to develop new therapeutic agents for the treatment of various diseases, including neurological disorders.

Keywords: Adenosine A2a receptor, QSAR, molecular fingerprints, synaptic transmission, signal transduction, response to stimulus, locomotory behavior, eating behavior, sleep, synaptic plasticity, neuronal excitability.
