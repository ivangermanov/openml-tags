The adenosine A2a receptor is a single protein target classified under membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and nucleotide-like receptor. It is found in Homo sapiens species group.

The adenosine A2a receptor has multiple relationships, including being a subset of adenosine receptors, adenosine A2 receptor protein family, and adenosine receptors A2a and A3 selectivity group.

Several molecules have been identified as interacting with this receptor, including istradefylline, binodenoson, sonedenoson, PBF-509, and ST1535. These molecules have various mechanisms of action, including antagonism and agonism, and have reached different phases of approval.

The adenosine A2a receptor has multiple functions and processes associated with it, including synaptic transmission, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and negative regulation of protein kinase activity.

It also plays a role in various biological processes, such as central nervous system development, blood coagulation, sensory perception, locomotory behavior, and eating behavior.

Keywords: QSAR, adenosine A2a receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, synaptic transmission, adenylate cyclase, central nervous system development, blood coagulation.
