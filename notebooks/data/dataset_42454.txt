Experiment data was obtained by running random configurations of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World K Nearest Neighbors algorithm through the Machine Learning for R framework on a diverse range of classification tasks sourced from OpenML. 

These tasks encompassed one hundred sixteen distinct datasets. The experiment's results included information about the task identification number, the specific dataset employed, the machine learning method utilized, the model's performance measured via mean misclassification error and log loss, the time required for training and prediction, the number of imputed variables selected during hyperparameter tuning, as well as various parameters specific to the Hierarchical Navigable Small World K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
