Grass Grub Damage Dataset

Tags: Agriculture, Earth Science

The Grass Grub Damage dataset was created to investigate the impact of grass grubs on pasture damage and economic loss in Canterbury. Grass grubs are a significant insect pest that can cause widespread damage to pastures, resulting in periodic and extensive losses. Factors influencing grass grub populations include biotic factors, such as diseases, and farming practices, including irrigation and heavy rolling.

The primary objective of this study was to establish a correlation between grass grub numbers, irrigation, and damage ranking over a seven-year period. By analyzing these relationships, researchers aimed to provide an objective estimate of the annual losses caused by grass grubs.

The dataset comprises nine attributes:

* Year Zone, which combines years and zones;
* Year of Trial;
* Strip of Paddock Sampled;
* Paddock Sampled;
* Damage Ranking (RJ Townsend);
* Damage Ranking (Other Researchers);
* Dry or Irrigated (indicating whether the paddock was dry, irrigated overhead, or irrigated using a border dyke system);
* Zone (position of paddock, including foothills, midplain, and coastal); and
* Grass Grub Numbers per Meter Squared.
