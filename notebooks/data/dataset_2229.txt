The QSAR-TID-11361 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Phosphorylase Kinase Gamma Subunit One. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and class features.

The features represent Fingerprint-Based Circular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The Phosphorylase Kinase Gamma Subunit One is a single protein that is also known as Phosphorylase b Kinase Gamma Catalytic Chain, Skeletal Muscle/Heart Isoform. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase protein kinase group/calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase PHk family.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including carbohydrate metabolic process, glycogen metabolic process, glycogen biosynthetic process, protein phosphorylation, and phosphorylation. It has various molecular functions, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, phosphorylase kinase activity, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and enzyme binding.
