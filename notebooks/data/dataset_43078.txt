Code Smells Blob Dataset

This dataset combines records from the Machine Learning Code Quality dataset with metrics extracted using the PMD Tool and the Understand tool, to determine whether a file contains code smells. Please note that the records are on subclass level.

The classification task involves binarizing the default class, namely severity, with a static threshold for better analysis.

The dataset includes features such as Repository, Package, Filename, Code Name, Commit Hash, Smell, Severity, Average Cyclomatic Complexity, Average Cyclomatic Modified Complexity, Average Cyclomatic Strict Complexity, Average Essential Complexity, Average Line Count, Average Line Blank Count, Average Line Code Count, Average Line Comment Count, Class Base Count, Class Coupled Count, Class Derived Count, Class Method Declaration Count, Class Variable Declaration Count, Executable Unit Declaration Count, File Declaration Count, Function Declaration Count, Instance Method Declaration Count, Instance Variable Declaration Count, Method Declaration Count, Total Method Declaration Count, Default Method Declaration Count, Private Method Declaration Count, Protected Method Declaration Count, Public Method Declaration Count, Input Count, Total Line Count, Blank Line Count, Code Line Count, Declared Code Line Count, Executable Code Line Count, Comment Line Count, Output Count, Path Count, Log Path Count, Semicolon Count, Statement Count, Declared Statement Count, Executable Statement Count, Cyclomatic Complexity, Modified Cyclomatic Complexity, Strict Cyclomatic Complexity, Essential Complexity, Knots, Maximum Cyclomatic Complexity, Maximum Modified Cyclomatic Complexity, Maximum Strict Cyclomatic Complexity, Maximum Essential Complexity, Maximum Essential Knots, Maximum Inheritance Tree Depth, Maximum Nesting, Minimum Essential Knots, Percentage Lack of Cohesion, Percentage Modified Lack of Cohesion, Comment-to-Code Ratio, Total Cyclomatic Complexity, Total Modified Cyclomatic Complexity, Total Strict Cyclomatic Complexity, Total Essential Complexity, Weighted Methods per Class, Number of Public Attributes, Number of Accessors and Mutators, Weighted Class Complexity, Tight Class Cohesion, Access to Foreign Data, and Class Name.
