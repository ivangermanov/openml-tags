The entire dataset covers the period from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active on these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean close price of the subsequent hour compared to the mean close price of the current hour.
