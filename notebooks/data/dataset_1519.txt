Robot Failures LP Dataset

Tags: mf less than, study, study, study, study

This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

The dataset includes multiple subsets, each defining a different learning problem:

- Failures in approach to grasp position
- Failures in transfer of a part
- Position of part after a transfer failure
- Failures in approach to ungrasp position (This specific dataset)
- Failures in motion with part

To improve classification accuracy, several feature transformation strategies were defined and evaluated, based on statistical summary features and discrete Fourier transform. This enabled an average improvement in accuracy.

All features are numeric, though integer-valued. Each feature represents a force or torque measured after failure detection. Each failure instance is characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection. The total observation window for each failure instance was of milliseconds.

Each example is described with a class followed by the evolution of forces and torques in the observation window. There is a total of features, representing the progression of forces and torques over time.

The dataset originates from research in robot learning at the task level, particularly in the assembly domain. It has been used in studies on feature transformation strategies for robot learning problems and integration of learning in supervision of flexible assembly systems.

This dataset provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners working on robotic systems, particularly in areas of failure detection, task learning, and assembly operations. The multiple learning problems and feature transformation strategies offer rich opportunities for developing and testing machine learning algorithms in the context of robotic applications.
