Water Bayesian Network. Sample Six.

This Bayesian network repository reference is available online.

The Water Bayesian Network consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, resulting in ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is around four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

This network is part of an expert system designed for control of waste water treatment. It represents an influence diagram for management of waste water treatment plants.

Features include various chemical and biological oxygen demand measurements, nitrogen and nitrate levels, and other water quality indicators.
