**Meta-Album MPII Human Pose Dataset**

The MPII Human Pose dataset is a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating articulated human pose estimation. It comprises approximately twenty-five thousand images featuring over forty thousand individuals with annotated body joints. These images were systematically gathered using an established taxonomy of everyday human activities. In total, the dataset encompasses four hundred and ten human activities, with each image accompanied by an activity label. Each image was extracted from a YouTube video. Similar to other Meta-Album datasets, this dataset has been preprocessed, and all images have been resized to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels.
