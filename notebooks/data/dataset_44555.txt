Name: Vehicle Seed Two Rows Two Thousand Columns One Hundred Classes Ten Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Vehicle with seed equals two, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. The function then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. It first selects a subset of classes, then selects a subset of columns, and finally selects a subset of rows. The function returns a new dataset with the selected data.

The dataset is a subsample of the original Vehicle dataset. The subsample function was used to select a subset of the data based on the given parameters. The parameters used were seed equals two, nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

The dataset features include compactness, circularity, distance circularity, radius ratio, principal axis aspect ratio, maximum length aspect ratio, scatter ratio, elongatedness, principal axis rectangularity, maximum length rectangularity, scaled variance major, scaled variance minor, scaled radius of gyration, skewness about major, skewness about minor, kurtosis about major, kurtosis about minor, and hollows ratio.
