The QSAR-TID-102718 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102718. This dataset has thirty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It shows activity values, unit is pseudo-pCI fifty, of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred two seven eighteen.

The features in this dataset do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. These features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-four FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, from zero to nine hundred ninety-three.

This dataset provides information about the Membrane-Bound Transcription Factor Site-One Protease, also known as Endopeptidase S One P, MBTPS One, and Site-One Protease. This enzyme belongs to the Serine Protease SB Clan and Serine Protease S Eight A Subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including Proteolysis, Lipid Metabolic Process, Lysosome Organization, Steroid Metabolic Process, and Cholesterol Metabolic Process.

This dataset can be used for further analysis and research in the field of health and medicine, particularly in the area of protein targets and enzymology.
