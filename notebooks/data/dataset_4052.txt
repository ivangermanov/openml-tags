The Isolet dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset was generated as follows: one hundred fifty subjects spoke the name of each letter of the alphabet twice, resulting in fifty-two training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of thirty speakers each, with four groups serving as the training set and the last group serving as the test set. Due to difficulties in recording, three examples were dropped.

Isolet is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task, and it is also an excellent domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms. 

All attributes are continuous, real-valued attributes scaled into the range minus one point zero to one point zero. These features include spectral coefficients, contour features, sonorant features, pre-sonorant features, and post-sonorant features.

Isolet is a spoken letter recognition dataset that is suitable for testing machine learning algorithms.
