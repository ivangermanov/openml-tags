QSAR-TID-10264 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Two, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Two, a single protein that is a fibroblast growth factor receptor. It is a protein target classification of enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase group/tyrosine protein kinase FGFR family. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, ureteric bud development, in utero embryonic development, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and positive regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation.

The receptor has been implicated in various diseases, including lacrimoauriculodentodigital syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome without genital anomalies or disordered steroidogenesis, Crouzon syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Apert syndrome, and Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome.

The dataset provides information on the receptor's expression, including its expression in various tissues and its subcellular localization. It also provides information on the receptor's function, including its role in signal transduction pathways, such as the PI3K cascade, and its interactions with other proteins.
