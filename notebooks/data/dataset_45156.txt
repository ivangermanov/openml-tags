Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample Three.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository provides this network, which has thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs. The number of parameters is substantial, totaling five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty. The average Markov blanket size is four point five seven, while the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network is cited in the proceedings of the Twelfth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the paper titled "MIDAS - An Influence Diagram for Management of Mildew in Winter Wheat".

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model that encompasses various factors related to mildew growth and management. It includes variables such as microclimate, leaf area index, fungal growth, temperature, radiation, and yield. These variables interact with each other in complex ways, making the network a valuable tool for understanding and predicting mildew behavior.
