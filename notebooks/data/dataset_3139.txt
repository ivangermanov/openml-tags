QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target protein is LXR beta (Liver X receptor beta), also known as LXRB, NER, and NRH. It is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. LXR beta belongs to the transcription factor/nuclear receptor family, specifically the nuclear hormone receptor subfamily  group H member.

LXR beta is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and cell differentiation. It functions as a DNA binding transcription factor, nuclear receptor, and has roles in protein binding and zinc ion binding. The protein is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and chromatin.

Several small molecule compounds have been studied as potential LXR beta modulators or agonists, reaching early clinical trial phases. These include BMS, LXR, CS, and hyodeoxycholic acid. The protein has been the subject of numerous studies related to lipid metabolism, cholesterol transport, and gene expression regulation.

LXR beta is involved in multiple signaling pathways and biological processes, including hormone mediated signaling, regulation of macrophage derived foam cell differentiation, triglyceride biosynthesis, cholesterol efflux, and lipid storage. It also plays a role in regulating the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and cold induced thermogenesis.

The protein has been studied using various experimental techniques and is cataloged in multiple biological databases, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is also referenced in pathway databases such as Reactome, where it is implicated in pathways related to lipid metabolism and gene expression regulation.
