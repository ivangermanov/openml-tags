The Ricci vs Destefano dataset contains the oral, written, and combined test scores for the New Haven Fire Department promotion exams. Additionally, the Race and Position for each test taker are provided.

The data was obtained from the district court's decision, briefs, and appendices.

Variable descriptions include:

* Race, which denotes White, Hispanic, or Black
* Position, which denotes Captain or Lieutenant
* Oral, representing the oral exam score
* Written, representing the written exam score
* Combine, representing the weighted total score, with sixty percent written and forty percent oral

Values are centered and delimited by blanks, with no missing values.

The story behind the data revolves around the New Haven Fire Department administering oral and written exams for promotion to Lieutenant and Captain in November and December of two thousand three. Under the contract between the City of New Haven and the firefighter's union, the written exam received a weight of sixty percent, while the oral exam received a weight of forty percent. Applicants with a total score of seventy percent or above passed the exam and became eligible for promotion.

A total of firefighters took the exam, among whom took the Lieutenant exam, and took the Captain exam. During the time of the exams, there were Lieutenant and Captain positions available. The City Charter of New Haven specifies that when promotions are made, the Department must select them from the top scorers. Consequently, the top Lieutenant scorers and top Captain scorers are eligible for potential promotion.

The City of New Haven decided not to certify the exam and promoted no one, citing that an insufficient number of minorities would receive a promotion to an existing position. This led to a lawsuit, where the court ultimately decided that the City's failure to certify the tests was a violation of Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act of nineteen sixty-four.

Pedagogical notes suggest that this data can be utilized for various analyses, including one-way Analysis of Variance on equality of average test scores for three races, two-way Analysis of Variance for equality of test scores for race and position, Chi-Square test on the equality of pass rates for three races, and Fisher-Freeman-Halton test on the equality of the potential promotion rates. Moreover, instructors can combine Blacks and Hispanics as minority groups, allowing for further analyses, such as two-sample T-test on equality of average test scores for majority versus minority, Chi-Square test on the equality of pass rates for majority versus minority, and Fisher's Exact Test on equality of the potential promotion rates for majority versus minority.
