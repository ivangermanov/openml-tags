Features: vertical ocean shear

This dataset contains information on vertical ocean shear measurements, which are crucial for understanding long-memory processes in geophysics. The data was collected using advanced oceanographic techniques to measure shear at various depths in the ocean. The sampling interval provides high-resolution data points, allowing for detailed analysis of ocean dynamics. This time series data is particularly useful for studying wavelets and the Allan variance in geophysical contexts. The dataset's numeric classification makes it suitable for quantitative analysis and modeling of ocean phenomena. Researchers can utilize this information to investigate long-term trends and patterns in ocean currents and mixing processes.
