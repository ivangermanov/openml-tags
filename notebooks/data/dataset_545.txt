Time Series Used in Long Memory Processes, The Allan Variance and Wavelets 

This chapter provides information on a dataset known as Vertical Ocean Shear Time Series.

The source of this data is the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington. 

The sampling interval for this series is 0.1 meters. The sample size consists of 6875 data points. 

The depth of the first data point is 350.0 meters, while the depth of the last data point is 1037.4 meters.

Information about the dataset includes its classification type as numeric, with a class index of one.
