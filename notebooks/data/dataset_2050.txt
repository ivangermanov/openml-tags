This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Five, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple Fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Five is a single protein preferred name, also known as Apoptosis Signal Regulating Kinase One, ASK One, MAP Three Kinase Five, and MAPK ERK Kinase Kinase Five.

It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, STE protein kinase group, STE protein kinase STE Eleven family.

It is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, STE protein kinase group, STE protein kinase STE Eleven family.

This protein is involved in multiple biological processes including apoptosis, cellular response to ischemia, cellular response to amino acid starvation, cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and cellular response to hydrogen peroxide.

It is also involved in positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of cardiac muscle cell apoptotic process, positive regulation of JUN kinase activity, and positive regulation of MAPK cascade.
