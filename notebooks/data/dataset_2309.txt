The QSAR-TID-101301 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101301. This dataset has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and a class feature.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101301.

The target in this dataset is a single protein, specifically the P2Y purinoceptor one, also known as the six H one orphan receptor, ADP receptor, P2RY one, P2Y one, and P2Y purinoceptor one. This protein belongs to the species Meleagris gallopavo and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and nucleotide-like receptor.

This protein has multiple functions, including nucleotide binding, G protein-coupled ADP receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, ATP binding, and G protein-coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor activity. It is involved in various biological processes, such as monoatomic ion transport, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, regulation of cell shape, platelet activation, G protein-coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of monoatomic ion transport, establishment of localization in cell, cellular response to organic cyclic compound, cellular response to purine-containing compound, and relaxation of muscle.

This protein is referenced in multiple databases, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
