QSAR-TID Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, study

Source: MetaQSAR project - September 

Please cite: This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version ) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID:, and it has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP, and many more...
