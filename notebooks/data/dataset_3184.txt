QSAR-TID-10116 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one zero one sixteen, and it has a number of rows and a number of features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systemes biivia. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
