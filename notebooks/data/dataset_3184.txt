**KDD Cup 2009 Dataset**

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a vital component of modern marketing strategies. The KDD Cup 2009 presents an exciting opportunity to work with large-scale marketing databases from the French telecom company Orange, aiming to predict customer behavior in terms of switching providers (churn), purchasing new products or services (appetency), and buying upgrades or add-ons (up-selling).

The most effective approach in a CRM system is to generate scores, which are evaluations of target variables that provide quantifiable insights. These scores are calculated using input variables that describe customer instances. Subsequently, these scores are utilized by the information system to personalize customer relationships.

An industrial customer analysis platform has been developed by Orange Labs, capable of building prediction models with an extremely large number of input variables. This platform implements various processing methods for instance and variable selection, prediction, and indexing based on an efficient model combined with variable selection regularization and model averaging techniques. The primary characteristic of this platform is its ability to scale on massive datasets comprising hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of variables.

Rapidly detecting the variables that contribute significantly to output predictions is crucial in marketing applications. The challenge lies in surpassing the in-house system developed by Orange Labs, showcasing the ability to handle vast, heterogeneous, and noisy datasets with unbalanced class distributions while meeting time-efficiency requirements.

**Task Description**

The objective is to estimate the churn, appetency, and up-selling probabilities of customers, resulting in three target values to be predicted. To test rapidity, the challenge is divided into phases. A substantial number of variables are available for prediction. To accommodate participants with limited computing resources, a smaller version of the dataset will be provided later in the challenge.

Churn rate, also referred to as attrition rate, measures the number of individuals or items moving into or out of a collection within a specified timeframe. In the context of business, churn rate is critical for companies relying on subscriber-based service models.

Appetency, in this context, represents the propensity to purchase a service or product.

Up-selling involves attempting to sell more expensive items, upgrades, or add-ons to increase profitability. It entails marketing more lucrative services or products, exposing customers to alternative options they might not have considered previously.
