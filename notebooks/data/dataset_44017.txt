Bike Sharing Demand

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics

This dataset is part of the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process, from membership to rental and return, has become automated. These systems allow users to easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. With over five hundred bike-sharing programs worldwide, comprising more than five hundred thousand bicycles, they play a significant role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health concerns.

The characteristics of the data generated by these systems make them attractive for research purposes. Unlike other transportation services, such as buses or subways, bike sharing systems record the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions explicitly. This feature transforms bike sharing systems into virtual sensor networks that can be used to monitor urban mobility. As a result, they can detect important events in the city.

The bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated with environmental and seasonal settings. Factors such as weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and time of day significantly influence rental behavior.

The core dataset consists of a two-year historical log from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly available. The data has been aggregated on an hourly and daily basis, and corresponding weather and seasonal information have been added. Weather information was extracted from online sources.

Attributes include:

Season, Year, Month, Hour, Holiday, Weekday, Working Day, Weather Situation, Temperature, Feeling Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Casual Users, Registered Users, Total Rental Bikes
