**FOREX EUR/SEK Minute High**

Tags: Finance, Forex, Forex High, Forex Minute

This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EUR/SEK currency pair, sourced from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a one-minute candlestick, covering a period from January first to December thirteenth. As the Forex market does not operate on weekends, these days are excluded from the dataset.

The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone. The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price movement in the subsequent minute, relative to the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean high price increases in the next minute, and false if it decreases or remains unchanged.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of close prices, also available in the dataset.
