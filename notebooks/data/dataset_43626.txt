The United States District Court of Houston had a case a few years ago that arises under Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act of Nineteen Sixty Four. The plaintiffs in this case were all female doctors at the Houston College of Medicine who claimed that the College had engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against women in giving promotions and setting salaries. The lead plaintiff in this action, a pediatrician and an assistant professor, was denied promotion at the College. The plaintiffs had presented a set of data to show that female faculty at the school were less likely to be full professors, more likely to be assistant professors, and earn less money than men, on average.

The data presented included information about the department each faculty member belonged to, their gender, whether their emphasis was primarily clinical or research, whether they were board certified, their publication rate, years of experience since obtaining their medical degree, their rank, and their salary in the academic years Nineteen Ninety Four and Nineteen Ninety Five.

The plaintiffs hoped to demonstrate a pattern of gender discrimination in the College's promotion and salary practices. They believed that the data would show that female faculty members were being unfairly held back and paid less than their male counterparts.

The case was significant because it highlighted the ongoing struggle for gender equality in the workplace, particularly in male-dominated fields such as medicine. The plaintiffs' claims of discrimination were based on a thorough analysis of the data, which they believed would reveal a systemic bias against women.
