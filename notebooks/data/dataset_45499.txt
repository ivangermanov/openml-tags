Bleichenbacher Timing Attack: Twenty Micro Seconds Dataset created on Thirteen September Two Thousand Twenty-Two

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset contains attributes related to three types of packets: Change Cipher Spec, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect.

Change Cipher Spec attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, kind, length, timestamp, time delta, and message order.

TLS Alert attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, kind, length, timestamp, time delta, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and message order.

TCP Disconnect attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, kind, length, timestamp, time delta, and message order.

Fold ID and vulnerable classes are also included in the dataset.

Features:

Label, Change Cipher Spec attributes, TLS Alert attributes, TCP Disconnect attributes, and fold ID.
