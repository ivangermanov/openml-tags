This Bayesian network is composed of a significant number of nodes and arcs, resulting in a large number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree indicate a moderate level of complexity.

The Hailfinder Bayesian network was designed to forecast severe weather conditions. It takes into account various factors such as atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and cloud formations to predict the likelihood of hail.

The network incorporates a wide range of features, including Capabilities in Scenario, Middle Level Lapse Rate, Wind Aloft, Low Level Lapse Rate, Scene Relative Atmospheric Moisture Content Index, Combined Moisture, Mean Relative Humidity, Synthetic Forcing, Atmospheric Instability Mountains, Scene Relative Atmospheric Instability, Morning Convection Index, Subjective Vertical Motion, Quasi Geostrophic Vertical Motion, Outflow from Mountains, Combined Clouds, Satellite Contoured Moisture, Area with Moist Dry Air, Atmospheric Instability Wind Liability Scene, Infrared Cloud Cover, Cloud Shade Convection, Lifted Index Fr twelve Z Density, Scene Relative Precipitation Forecast, Current Propagation Convection, and more.

This Bayesian network has been used in various applications related to manufacturing and has shown promising results.
