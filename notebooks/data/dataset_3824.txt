QSAR-TID-10034 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand thirty-four. It has five hundred seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited when used for research purposes.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID, molecular fingerprints 

Scraped Data:

The Bradykinin B two Receptor is a single protein that is also known as B two Bradykinin Receptor, B two R, and BDKRB two. It is a member of the family A G protein coupled receptor group and is involved in the peptide receptor group. It is specifically a short peptide receptor. 

The receptor is classified under one, membrane receptor, and is a part of the G protein coupled receptor group. It is specifically a peptide receptor and is involved in smooth muscle contraction, inflammatory response, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

The receptor is also involved in positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, blood circulation, response to salt stress, regulation of vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and regulation of vascular permeability.
