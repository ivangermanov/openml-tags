QSAR-TID-10034 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10034. The dataset has 574 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and shows the activity values of several compounds on the Bradykinin B2 receptor, a single protein target.

The Bradykinin B2 receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, inflammatory response, and blood circulation. It is also known to play a role in the regulation of vascular permeability and vasodilation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Bradykinin B2 receptor. The data can be used to build predictive models and identify potential lead compounds for further development.
