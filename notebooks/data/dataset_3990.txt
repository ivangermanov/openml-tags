Amazon Employee Access is a machine learning competition on Kaggle that involves predicting whether an employee will be granted or denied access to certain resources based on historical data. This dataset comprises real historical data collected over a period of time, featuring instances where employees were manually allowed or denied access to resources.

The goal is to develop an algorithm that can learn from this historical data and accurately predict approval or denial for a new set of employees. To achieve this, the algorithm will rely on various features, including Action, Resource, Manager Identification, Role Rollup One, Role Rollup Two, Role Department Name, Role Title, Role Family Description, and Role Family Code.
