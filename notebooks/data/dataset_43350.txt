US Breweries
Context

While brainstorming ideas for a statistics project for a course, the idea of utilizing data about microbreweries came up. Unfortunately, after some exploration and thought, we scrapped the idea, but we have this data to show for it anyway.

Content

The data was acquired from Beer Month Club and contains information about breweries available on the site. The data includes information such as the brewery's name, type of brewery, address, website, and state. 

Code used to scrape the data is available online.

Acknowledgements

Thanks to Beer Month Club for allowing the brewery section to be scraped.

Inspiration

This data alone isn't too inspiring, but maybe it could be used as the basis for an analysis project that looks at information such as Yelp reviews or the number of links to a brewery's website. This could lead to some interesting insights into the craft beer industry.
