The QSAR-TID-215 dataset is a collection of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data related to the Earth Science and Meteorology fields, specifically focused on the MetaQSAR project. This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 215.

The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features such as MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is particularly useful for studying the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M5, which is a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as CHRM5 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M5.

The receptor belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under the category of 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family A GPCR)/Monoamine receptor/Acetylcholine receptor.

The description of this receptor highlights its role in various biological processes, including gastric acid secretion, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and chemical synaptic transmission.
