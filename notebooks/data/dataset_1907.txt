The QSAR-TID-10407 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin II. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

Trypsin II is also known as anionic trypsin and is a single protein enzyme that belongs to the serine protease family. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, digestion, and collagen catabolic process.
