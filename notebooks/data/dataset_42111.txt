S2 is a synthetic dataset consisting of two-dimensional data with five thousand vectors, divided into fifteen Gaussian clusters with varying degrees of cluster overlap. This dataset is particularly useful for testing clustering algorithms, as the clusters exhibit different levels of separation and density. The Iterative Shrinking Method for Clustering Problems, a research paper published in Pattern Recognition, utilizes this dataset to evaluate the performance of its proposed clustering technique.
