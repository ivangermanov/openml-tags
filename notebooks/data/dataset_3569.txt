QSAR-TID-112 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 112, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was generated from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains molecular fingerprints that do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Features include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and many other molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
