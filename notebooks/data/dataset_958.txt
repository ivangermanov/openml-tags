Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: This dataset includes various image-related features such as region centroid column and row, region pixel count, short line density, vertical and horizontal edge mean and standard deviation, intensity mean, raw color means (red, blue, green), excess color means, value mean, saturation mean, hue mean, and binary class.

The segment dataset focuses on image analysis and classification, providing a range of features extracted from visual data. It has been modified from its original multi-class format to a binary classification problem, simplifying the target variable. This transformation allows for more straightforward analysis and modeling approaches. The dataset's features encompass various aspects of image processing, including spatial characteristics, edge detection, color information, and statistical measures.
