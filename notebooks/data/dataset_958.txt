The binarized version of this original dataset has been modified to convert the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

Originally, this dataset consisted of various features including Region Centroid Column, Region Centroid Row, Region Pixel Count, Short Line Density, V Edge Mean, V Edge Standard Deviation, H Edge Mean, H Edge Standard Deviation, Intensity Mean, Raw Red Mean, Raw Blue Mean, Raw Green Mean, Ex Red Mean, Ex Blue Mean, Ex Green Mean, Value Mean, Saturation Mean, Hue Mean, and Binary Class.
