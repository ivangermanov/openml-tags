The United Nations Development Program compiled an Index of Human Development. The data includes columns for Country (character), Index, GNP per capita rank, and the difference between HDI rank and GNP rank.

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure created by the United Nations Development Program to assess the quality of life in different nations. It combines three key elements: life expectancy, adult literacy, and Gross National Product per capita. By comparing each country's indicators against global benchmarks, a worldwide HDI ranking is established.

Analyzing the HDI ratings in comparison to traditional GNP per capita rankings reveals interesting insights. Some less affluent countries have made remarkable progress in human development by efficiently allocating aid to their most vulnerable populations. Conversely, certain wealthy nations, including the United States, have not effectively translated their economic prosperity into comprehensive social benefits.

The HDI rankings highlight regional trends. Arab and Muslim countries generally score poorly, primarily due to low female literacy rates. Former communist nations tend to perform well because of their emphasis on literacy, despite generally lower GNPs. Latin American countries often receive positive scores, benefiting from previously established higher literacy rates and improved healthcare systems, despite lower GNPs.

African nations present a mixed picture. Some oil-exporting countries like Angola, Gabon, Cameroon, and Congo have not successfully converted their wealth into social advantages. In contrast, nations such as Tanzania, Madagascar, and Zambia, despite economic challenges, have managed to enhance their citizens' health and education.

Among more prosperous nations, physical and educational benefits have generally kept pace with economic growth. However, the United States stands out as an exception, where economic flourishing in the s was not matched by commensurate improvements in social services.

The dataset provides a comprehensive list of countries ranked according to their Human Development Index, offering a nuanced perspective on global quality of life beyond mere economic indicators. It serves as a valuable tool for assessing how effectively nations utilize their resources to benefit their populations.
