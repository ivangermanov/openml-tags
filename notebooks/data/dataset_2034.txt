This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015.

Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3 is a single protein preferred name, also known as Chrm3 or Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.

It is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle contraction, negative regulation of heart rate by acetylcholine, smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission.

It is also involved in various molecular functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, G protein-coupled serotonin receptor activity, GTPase activator activity, protein binding, and acetylcholine binding.
