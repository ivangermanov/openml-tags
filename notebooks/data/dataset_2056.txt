QSAR-TID-10809 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10809. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it for your research purposes.

Demographic information about the dataset includes its source, ChEMBL version seventeen, and its features, which do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the Sphingosine one phosphate receptor Edg-six, also known as endothelial differentiation G-protein coupled receptor six, S one P four, S one PR four, and S one P receptor four. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under membrane receptor, family A G-protein coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and EDG receptor.

The dataset provides description relationships, accession, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also includes Gene Ontology components, functions, processes, and other relevant information.
