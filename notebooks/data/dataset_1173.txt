The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass, which describes characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis, which can be either benign or malignant.

This data set has thirty descriptive features, which are computed for each of three cell nuclei. These features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

Radius refers to the mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter. Texture is the standard deviation of gray-scale values. Perimeter, area, and smoothness are self-explanatory. Compactness is calculated by dividing the perimeter squared by the area minus one point zero. Concavity refers to the severity of concave portions of the contour, while concave points refer to the number of concave portions of the contour. Symmetry is another feature, and finally, fractal dimension is calculated using the coastline approximation minus one.

This data set is based on research published in several papers, including Nuclear Feature Extraction for Breast Tumor Diagnosis and Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis via Linear Programming.
