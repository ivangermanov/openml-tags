Experiment Data Obtained by Running Random Configurations of a Support Vector Machine through Machine Learning in R on Various Classification Tasks from OpenML.

This dataset contains information about the performance of a Support Vector Machine on different classification tasks. The tasks are identified by their task ID and dataset name. The learner used is a Support Vector Machine, and its performance is measured in terms of mean misclassification error and log loss. The time taken to train and predict the model is also recorded. The kernel used in the Support Vector Machine, as well as its cost, gamma, tolerance, and shrinking parameters, are also included. Additionally, the number of imputed values selected through conditional parameter optimization and whether the model was fitted successfully are noted.

Keywords: Support Vector Machine, Machine Learning, Classification Tasks, OpenML, Performance Metrics.
