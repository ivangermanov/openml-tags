Airfoil Self Noise 
Tags: Images, Machine Learning 

Data Description 
The Airfoil Self Noise dataset, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel, aims to predict the scaled self noise. This comprehensive dataset comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack.

Attribute Description 
The dataset consists of six attributes: frequency, measured in Hertz; angle of attack, measured in degrees; chord length, measured in meters; free stream velocity, measured in meters per second; displacement thickness, measured in meters; and sound pressure, measured in decibels, which is the target feature.

Dataset Information 
The Airfoil Self Noise dataset has been carefully curated to ensure consistency across all experiments, with the span of the airfoil and the observer position remaining the same throughout. This dataset does not contain any missing values.

Additional Information 
This problem involves predicting the scaled sound pressure level based on five input variables: frequency, angle of attack, chord length, free stream velocity, and suction side displacement thickness. The only output variable is the scaled sound pressure level.
