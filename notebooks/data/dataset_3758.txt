QSAR-TID-20128 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20128. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20128. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the protein target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The protein target is a single protein, specifically the Protein Kinase Pfmrk, which is a MO15-related protein kinase Pfmrk. The dataset also contains information on the protein's function, including its role in nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, and transferase activity.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.
