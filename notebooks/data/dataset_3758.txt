The QSAR-TID-20128 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID 20128, also known as Protein Kinase Pfmrk. This dataset has one hundred rows and over one thousand features, including molecular identifiers and class features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

This dataset is related to the protein target classification of enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase CDK family. The description of this protein target is an MO fifteen-related protein kinase Pfmrk, which is a single protein from the organism Plasmodium falciparum.

This protein target has several functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, and transferase activity. It is involved in several biological processes, including protein phosphorylation and phosphorylation.

This dataset can be cross-referenced with other datasets using accession numbers, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
