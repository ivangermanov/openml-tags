This dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. The specific type of software is unknown. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 1970s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

- Assessing Predictors of Software Defects, Workshop on Predictive Software Models, Chicago

Features include various code metrics such as:
Lines of blank code, branch count, call pairs, lines of code and comments, lines of comments, condition count, cyclomatic complexity, cyclomatic density, decision count, design complexity, design density, edge count, essential complexity, essential density, executable lines of code, parameter count, global data complexity, global data density, Halstead metrics (content, difficulty, effort, error estimate, length, level, programming time, volume), maintenance severity, modified condition count, multiple condition count, node count, normalized cyclomatic complexity, number of operands, number of operators, number of unique operands, number of unique operators, total number of lines, percent comments, and total lines of code.
