The MC1 dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, containing software defect prediction information. The specific type of software used is unknown. This dataset was created using McCabe and Halstead features extractors, which were developed in the 1970s to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Relevant research has been conducted on this dataset, including studies on data quality and the effectiveness of blind spot sampling policies. Additionally, researchers have assessed predictors of software defects using this dataset.

The dataset contains various features extracted from source code, including lines of blank code, branch count, call pairs, lines of code and comments, comments, condition count, cyclomatic complexity, design complexity, edge count, essential complexity, global data complexity, Halstead metrics, maintenance severity, modified condition count, multiple condition count, node count, normalized cyclomatic complexity, number of operands, number of operators, number of unique operands, number of unique operators, and total lines of code.
