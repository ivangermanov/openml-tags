Electrical Length Data Set

This problem, which involves only two input variables, has a small search space, which means it has relatively low complexity. However, it is still an intriguing problem because the system is strongly nonlinear, and the available data is limited to a low number of examples that present noise. All of these drawbacks make the modeling surface extremely complicated, and in this case, they produce a strong overfitting of the obtained models.
