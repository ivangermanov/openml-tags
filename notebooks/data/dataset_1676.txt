QSAR-TID-10485 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10485. It has thirty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID 

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. 

This dataset is related to the Neurotensin Receptor One, also known as Single Protein, which is a type of membrane receptor classified under Family A G protein-coupled receptor and Peptide receptor. It is primarily found in the Mus musculus species group. 

Expression Atlas shows the relationship between this receptor and other proteins. Component analysis reveals its presence in various cellular components, including plasma membrane, cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane, and cell surface. 

Functional analysis shows that this receptor exhibits G protein-coupled receptor activity, neuropeptide receptor activity, and identical protein binding. It is primarily involved in processes such as temperature homeostasis, signal transduction, and learning.
