GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating diverse quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the ROC curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stemmed from the growing need in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems that could be used by different researchers. This enables the comparison of various classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

The origin of the data lies in the large, publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and is released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions.

The availability of this information translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike. Although multiple sources of gene expression data are available, the decision to utilize data from the expO repository was made due to the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the availability of a large number of samples for different tumor types.
