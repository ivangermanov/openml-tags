QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule identifiers and median activity values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Serine/threonine protein kinase Sgk, a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. This kinase is associated with various cellular processes and functions, including protein phosphorylation, cell growth regulation, and intracellular signal transduction. It is localized in endosomes, cytosol, and cytoplasmic vesicles.

The target protein exhibits multiple functions, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, and various ion channel regulator activities. It is involved in biological processes like regulation of cell migration, DNA binding transcription factor activity, and negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling.

The protein is referenced in several databases, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It contains domains such as protein kinase, AGC kinase C terminal, and PX domains. The target is classified as a stimulus sensing channel in Reactome and is considered a potential drug target (Tchem) in Pharos.

This QSAR dataset provides valuable information for studying the structure activity relationships of compounds interacting with the Serine/threonine protein kinase Sgk, which could aid in drug discovery efforts targeting this protein.
