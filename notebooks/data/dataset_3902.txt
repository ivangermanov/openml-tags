This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Serotonin 1b Receptor, and it has numerous rows and features. The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its type, preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target is a single protein known as the Serotonin 1b Receptor, also referred to as 5-HT1b, 5-HT-1B, or 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, specifically the monoamine receptor subgroup.

The dataset also includes information about the gene ontology components, functions, and processes related to the target. These include cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, dendrite, and other cellular components. The gene ontology functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and serotonin binding. The processes involve signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and synaptic transmission.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about the target's relationships with other proteins, including its membership in protein families and complexes. It also includes cross-references to other databases, such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and Reactome.
