QSAR-TID-10577 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10577. The dataset has 397 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the serotonin 1b receptor.

Scraped Data:

The serotonin 1b receptor is a single protein target, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including neurotransmission and behavior.

The receptor is expressed in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane, and is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling. It is also involved in the response to various stimuli, including toxic substances, cocaine, and ethanol.

The receptor has been implicated in various diseases and disorders, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. It is a potential target for the development of new therapeutic agents.
