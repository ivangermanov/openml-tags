Code Smells Data Class Tags: This dataset combines records from the Multi-Language Code Quality dataset with metrics extracted using the PMD Tool and the Understand tool, to determine whether a file contains code smells. Please note that the records are on subclass level. This is a classification task, where the default class, namely severity, should be binarized with a static threshold, preferably between a certain range. Please carefully read the publication to understand how to use this dataset.

The dataset features include repository, package, file name, code name, commit hash, smell, severity, average cyclomatic complexity, average cyclomatic complexity modified, average cyclomatic complexity strict, average essential complexity, average line count, average blank line count, average code line count, and average comment line count. Additionally, it includes count of class base, count of class coupled, count of class coupled modified, count of class derived, count of class declarations, count of class method declarations, count of class variable declarations, count of executable unit declarations, count of file declarations, count of function declarations, count of instance method declarations, count of instance variable declarations, count of method declarations, count of method declarations all, count of method declarations default, count of method declarations private, count of method declarations protected, count of method declarations public, count of input, count of lines, count of blank lines, count of code lines, count of code lines declarations, count of code lines executable, count of comment lines, count of output, count of path, count of path log, count of semicolons, count of statements, count of statement declarations, count of statement executable, cyclomatic complexity, cyclomatic complexity modified, cyclomatic complexity strict, essential complexity, knots, maximum cyclomatic complexity, maximum cyclomatic complexity modified, maximum cyclomatic complexity strict, maximum essential complexity, maximum essential knots, maximum inheritance tree, maximum nesting, minimum essential knots, percentage lack of cohesion, percentage lack of cohesion modified, ratio of comment to code, sum of cyclomatic complexity, sum of cyclomatic complexity modified, sum of cyclomatic complexity strict, sum of essential complexity, weighted operations per class, number of public attributes, number of accessor methods, weighted method count, tight class cohesion, abstractness versus functionality distribution, and class name.
