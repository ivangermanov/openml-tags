The CPU Activity dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. It is a collection of computer systems activity measures. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation with 128 megabytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files, or running very CPU-bound programs.

The data was collected continuously on two separate occasions. On both occasions, system activity was gathered every five seconds. The final dataset is taken from both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming from each collection epoch.

System measures used include reads and writes between system memory and user memory, system calls of all types, system read and write calls, fork and execute calls, character transfers, page outs, page ins, page faults, process run queue size, memory pages available to user processes, disk blocks available for page swapping, and portions of time spent in user mode, system mode, idle waiting for block input/output, and otherwise idle.

The two different regression tasks obtained from these databases are predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode from all attributes, and predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode using a restricted number of attributes excluding paging information.

This dataset has characteristics of eight thousand one hundred ninety-two cases and twenty-two continuous attributes.
