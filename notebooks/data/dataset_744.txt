This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The features included in this dataset are twenty-five in total, including Oz One through Oz Twenty-Five, and finally, Binary Class.
