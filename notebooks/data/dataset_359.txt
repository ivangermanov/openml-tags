The Analcatdata Collection is a compilation of datasets used in the book "Analyzing Categorical Data". This comprehensive repository consists of a zip file containing two versions of each of eighty-four datasets, accompanied by this informative README file.

Each dataset is presented in both comma-delimited ASCII format (CSV) and Microsoft Excel format (XLS). The datasets are available for use free of charge for scientific, educational, and non-commercial purposes, provided that proper acknowledgement is given through citation of the original reference.
