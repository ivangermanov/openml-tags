Context: Imbalanced Classes Put Accuracy Out of Business

This is a surprisingly common problem in machine learning, specifically in classification, occurring in datasets with a disproportionate ratio of observations in each class. Standard accuracy no longer reliably measures performance, which makes model training much trickier. Imbalanced classes appear in many domains, including anti-fraud and anti-spam.

Inspiration: Five Tactics for Handling Imbalanced Classes in Machine Learning

When dealing with imbalanced classes, it is essential to adopt alternative strategies to ensure accurate model performance. Here are five tactics to consider:

Upsample the Minority Class: Increase the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset.

Downsample the Majority Class: Reduce the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset.

Change Your Performance Metric: Move away from standard accuracy and adopt metrics that are more suitable for imbalanced datasets, such as F1 score or area under the ROC curve.

Penalize Algorithms (Cost-Sensitive Training): Assign different costs to misclassification errors based on the class, thereby penalizing the algorithm for misclassifying the minority class.

Use Tree-Based Algorithms: Utilize tree-based algorithms, such as decision trees or random forests, which are more robust to class imbalance.
