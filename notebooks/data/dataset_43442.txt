Imbalanced Classes Put Accuracy Out of Business 

This is a surprisingly common problem in machine learning, specifically in classification, occurring in datasets with a disproportionate ratio of observations in each class. It is a challenge that arises when one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the others, leading to biased models that favor the majority class.

Standard accuracy no longer reliably measures performance, which makes model training much trickier. The issue of imbalanced classes appears in many domains, including anti-fraud systems and anti-spam filters.

To tackle this problem, several strategies have been developed. Here are five tactics for handling imbalanced classes in machine learning:

One approach is to up-sample the minority class, thereby increasing its presence in the dataset. Another tactic involves down-sampling the majority class, reducing its influence on the model. A third strategy involves changing the performance metric used to evaluate the model, moving away from standard accuracy towards more nuanced measures. A fourth tactic is to penalize algorithms during cost-sensitive training, assigning higher costs to misclassification of the minority class. Finally, using tree-based algorithms has also been shown to be effective in handling imbalanced classes.

The dataset features include month, credit amount, credit term, age, sex, education, product type, and family status.
