This dataset contains historical price data of the New Zealand Dollar versus the United States Dollar (NZD/USD) currency pair from Dukascopy.

One instance, or row, represents a single candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans a period from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute signifies the direction of the mean high price in relation to the subsequent minute. Specifically, it indicates whether the mean high price is increasing or decreasing (or remains unchanged) in the following minute. Therefore, the class attribute assumes a value of True if the mean high price rises in the subsequent minute and False otherwise.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions. Realistic trade strategies can only be applied to predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.
