Robot Failures LP2 Dataset
Tags: mf less than 80, study 123

This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals. The dataset is part of a larger collection focusing on robot execution failures.

The Robot Failures LP2 dataset specifically deals with failures in the transfer of a part. It is one of five datasets in the collection, each defining a different learning problem related to robot failures. The other datasets cover failures in approach to grasp position, position of part after a transfer failure, failures in approach to ungrasp position, and failures in motion with part.

To improve classification accuracy, researchers developed and evaluated five feature transformation strategies based on statistical summary features and discrete Fourier transform, among others. This approach enabled an average improvement of 20% in accuracy.

All features in the dataset are numeric, although they are integer-valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection. Each failure instance is characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection. The total observation window for each failure instance was 315 milliseconds.

The dataset structure includes a class label followed by the evolution of forces and torques (Fx, Fy, Fz, Tx, Ty, Tz) in the observation window. There is a total of 90 features representing the force and torque measurements at different time points.

This dataset is valuable for studying robot learning problems, particularly in the assembly domain. It has been used in research on feature transformation strategies, integration and learning in supervision of flexible assembly systems, and other related topics in robotics and automation.

The original dataset was created and donated by researchers from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. It is available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
