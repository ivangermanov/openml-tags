Column Description
This dataset contains information collected by the US Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. It was obtained from the StatLib archive, and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms. The dataset is small in size, and the data was originally published.

Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over a certain size
Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
Charles River dummy variable (equals one if tract bounds river, otherwise zero)
Nitric oxides concentration
Average number of rooms per dwelling
Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to a certain year
Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
Index of accessibility to radial highways
Full-value property-tax rate
Pupil-teacher ratio by town
