Australian Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Australian with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in self, seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses numpy's random default random generator to generate random numbers. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. If the number of classes is greater than nclasses max, it selects a random subset of classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than ncols max, it selects a random subset of columns. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, it uses train test split to select a stratified subset of the data.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, including the categorical mask and column names.
