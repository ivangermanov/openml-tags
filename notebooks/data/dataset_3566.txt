QSAR-TID-12753 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma, and it has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma, a single protein that is also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group C Member Three. It is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, and inflammation.

The dataset provides information about the protein's structure, function, and interactions, including its binding sites, ligands, and downstream targets. It also includes data on the protein's role in various diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma and its role in human health and disease.
