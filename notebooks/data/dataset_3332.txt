QSAR-TID-17145 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17145. The dataset has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17145. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase Two, which is a single protein target. The target is also known as Seventy kDa Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase Two, P70-Beta, P70 Ribosomal S6 Kinase Beta, and P70S6K2. The target is a protein kinase that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and the AGC protein kinase RSK family.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the target in different tissues and cells, as well as its function and role in various biological processes. The target is involved in the regulation of translation, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and other cellular processes.
