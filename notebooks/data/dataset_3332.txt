The analysis is performed for different sets of input values using a methodology similar to that described in a research paper on taming instabilities in power grid networks by decentralized control. Several input values are kept constant throughout the analysis, including an averaging time of two seconds, a coupling strength of eight per second squared, and a damping of zero point one per second.

This Electrical Grid Stability dataset provides valuable information on various aspects of power grid networks. It consists of eleven predictive attributes and two goal fields. The first set of attributes, denoted by tau, represents the reaction time of participants in seconds, ranging from zero point five to ten seconds. Specifically, tau one refers to the reaction time of an electricity producer.

The second set of attributes, denoted by p, represents the nominal power consumed or produced, measured in units per second squared. For consumers, this value ranges from negative zero point five to negative two per second squared. Additionally, p one is equal to the absolute value of the sum of p two, p three, and p four.

The third set of attributes, denoted by g, represents coefficients proportional to price elasticity, measured in units per second, ranging from zero point zero five to one per second. Specifically, g one refers to the coefficient for an electricity producer.

The two goal fields are stab and stabf. Stab represents the maximal real part of the characteristic equation root, which determines the stability of the system. If this value is positive, the system is considered linearly unstable. Stabf, on the other hand, is a categorical label indicating whether the system is stable or unstable.
