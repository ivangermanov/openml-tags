QSAR-TID-11018 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11018. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the cGMP-dependent protein kinase 2, which is a single protein target. This protein is also known as cGK2, cGK 2, cGKII, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase II. It is an enzyme that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and PKG family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and phosphorylation. It is also associated with several cellular components, including the cytosol, plasma membrane, and nuclear membrane.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and can be used to develop predictive models for the cGMP-dependent protein kinase 2 target.
