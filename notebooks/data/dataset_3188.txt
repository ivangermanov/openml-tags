QSAR-TID-100483 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100483. The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase Epsilon. This protein is a single protein, also known as Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Epsilon, R-PTP-epsilon, and is found in the species Homo sapiens.

The protein target classification is Enzyme/Phosphatase/Protein Phosphatase/Tyrosine protein phosphatase/Receptor Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase. The protein is involved in several biological processes, including protein dephosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and negative regulation of insulin receptor signaling pathway.

The protein has several functions, including phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, protein binding, hydrolase activity, and phosphatase activity. The protein is located in the nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and membrane.
