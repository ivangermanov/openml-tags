This dataset, named QSAR-TID-100483, is tagged with Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dated September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100483. There are seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and one thousand twenty-four FCFP six molecular fingerprint features, ranging from FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero to FCFP six one hundred twenty-four nine hundred twenty-five, and more.

Scraped data includes information about the receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase epsilon, also known as protein-tyrosine phosphatase epsilon, PTPRE, and R-PTP-epsilon. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens, classified as an enzyme, phosphatase, protein phosphatase, and tyrosine protein phosphatase.

Description, relationship, accession, and receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase epsilon are single proteins. Expression Atlas, Component, Go Function, Go Process, Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Tbio, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe provide additional information about this protein.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, MTLQSAR, MetaQSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase epsilon, protein-tyrosine phosphatase, phosphatase, enzyme.
