This dataset is a fake detector, which means it is designed to identify and flag artificial or manipulated data. It is tagged with excessively sensitive cross sectional data, indicating that it is highly sensitive to subtle changes in the data. The features of this dataset are artificial and transformed, suggesting that they have been modified or engineered in some way.
