This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Sphingosine One Phosphate Receptor Two, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP Six One Zero Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.

Scraped Data includes information about the target, such as its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. 

The target is a single protein known as Sphingosine One Phosphate Receptor Two, also referred to as EDG Five, S One P Two, S One P Receptor Two, and others. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a one membrane receptor, family A G protein coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and EDG receptor.

Keywords: QSAR, Sphingosine One Phosphate Receptor, Molecular Fingerprints, Drug Target, ChEMBL ID.
