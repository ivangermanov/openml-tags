The QSAR-TID-10814 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 10814, and it has multiple rows and numerous features.

This dataset was generated as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and should be cited accordingly. It includes molecular fingerprints, specifically FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The features in this dataset include molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty. The remaining features represent the aforementioned molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is related to the Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Edg four, which is also known as Edg four, Lpa two, Lpa minus two, Lpar two, and Lpa Receptor two. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein.

The Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Edg four is a type of membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, and activation of phospholipase C activity.
