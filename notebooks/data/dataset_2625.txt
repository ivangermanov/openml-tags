MIP 2016 Classification Dataset

This dataset is related to Algorithm Selection, Demographics, and Geography. It contains the PAR10 performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of MIPLIB 2010.

The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the evaluations of the twelve thread table. The features were generated using the Mixed Integer Programming feature computation code. To record runtimes of the feature computations, Runsolver was utilized.

This dataset is part of the Open Algorithm Challenge 2017, also known as Mira. It contains various features, including instance identification, problem type, number of variables, number of constraints, number of non-zero coefficients, linear programming average, linear programming L2 average, linear programming L-infinity, and linear programming objective value.

Other features include the number of binary variables, integer variables, continuous variables, semi-continuous variables, and non-integer variables, as well as their respective ratios. Additionally, there are features related to unbounded discrete variables, support size, right-hand side coefficients, variable constraint graph degrees, constraint weights, and objective coefficients.
