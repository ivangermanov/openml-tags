QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a non receptor tyrosine protein kinase TNK, also known as CD negative kinase or TNK. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Ack family classification. It is associated with various cellular components including cytoplasm and membrane, and has multiple functions such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, and ATP binding. The protein is involved in processes like protein phosphorylation and protein autophosphorylation.

Cross references for this target protein are available in several databases including ExpressionAtlas, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. These references provide additional information on the protein's structure, function, and interactions.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains valuable information for researchers studying drug target interactions and developing quantitative structure activity relationship models.
