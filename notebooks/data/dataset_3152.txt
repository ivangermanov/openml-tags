This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including identifiers and class features.

The features represent Fixed Circular FingerPrints molecular fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The MetaQSAR project provides this dataset, which was created in September two thousand fifteen.
