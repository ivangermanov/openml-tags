QSAR TID Tags: MTLQSAR, study

Source: MetaQSAR project - September

Please cite: This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID:, and it has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP, and many more molecular fingerprint features.

This comprehensive dataset provides valuable quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) information for drug discovery and development. It includes molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES notation, which encode structural information about chemical compounds. The activity values are measured in pseudo pCI units, indicating the potency of compounds against a specific drug target. The data was sourced from the ChEMBL database, a widely used resource in medicinal chemistry and drug design.

The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are based on the FCFP (Functional-Class Fingerprints) method, which captures functional properties of molecules. These fingerprints provide a detailed representation of chemical structures, allowing for sophisticated analysis and prediction of biological activity. The use of Pipeline Pilot software ensures consistency and reliability in fingerprint generation.

This dataset is particularly useful for researchers and pharmaceutical companies engaged in computational drug discovery, as it enables the development and validation of predictive models for compound activity. The inclusion of a large number of features allows for in-depth exploration of structure-activity relationships and the potential identification of novel drug candidates.
