Data Set Information:
This dataset is derived from customer reviews on the Amazon Commerce Website for authorship identification purposes. While previous studies typically conducted identification experiments for a small number of authors, this dataset aims to examine the robustness of classification algorithms in an online context where reviews often have more potential authors. To achieve this, the researchers identified fifty of the most active users who frequently posted reviews in these newsgroups. Each author is represented by a unique ID and username, and thirty reviews were collected for each author.

Attribute Information:
The attribution includes various aspects of the authors' linguistic style, such as:
- Usage of digits
- Punctuation patterns
- Word and sentence length
- Usage frequency of words
- And other linguistic features

Features:
The dataset includes numerous features (V through V) that capture different aspects of the authors' writing style. These features are designed to represent the linguistic characteristics and patterns unique to each author, enabling the development and testing of authorship identification algorithms.
