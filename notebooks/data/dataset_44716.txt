The nomao Seed Three Dataset with Two Thousand Rows and One Hundred Columns 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original nomao dataset. It was generated using a specific set of parameters, including a seed value of three, a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratification parameter was set to true.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the dataset were identified, and then a random selection of ten classes was made. The indices where these classes were present were selected, and the corresponding data points were kept.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If there were more than one hundred columns, a random selection of one hundred column indices was made, and the corresponding columns were kept.

Finally, the dataset was stratified according to the target variable, and a random subset of two thousand data points was selected.

This dataset has a total of one hundred features, which are listed below:

Features: Variable One, Variable Two, Variable Three, Variable Four, Variable Five, ...
