House Sixteen H Seed Zero Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Stratified 

This dataset is a subsampling of the House Sixteen H dataset, generated using a specific source code. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The dataset has been generated with the following parameters: a fixed seed value, a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratification option has been set to true, which means that the sampling process will attempt to maintain the original class distribution in the resulting dataset.

The source code used to generate this dataset involves several steps. First, it uniformly samples classes from the original dataset, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency distribution. It then selects the indices corresponding to these chosen classes and subsets the original dataset accordingly.

Next, the code uniformly samples columns from the resulting dataset, selecting a specified number of columns randomly. It then subsets the dataset further to include only these chosen columns.

Finally, the code applies stratified sampling to the resulting dataset, ensuring that the class distribution is maintained while reducing the dataset to the desired size.

Features of this dataset include various health-related metrics, although some of these feature names may be unclear due to their technical nature.
