The Electricity dataset is a widely used collection of data described and analyzed in various research papers. This dataset was compiled from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, where prices are not fixed and are influenced by the demand and supply of the market. Prices are set every five minutes, and electricity transfers to or from the neighboring state of Victoria were carried out to alleviate fluctuations.

The dataset, originally named ELEC2, contains a large number of instances dated from May 1996 to December 1998. Each example in the dataset refers to a period of thirty minutes, resulting in forty-eight instances for each twenty-four-hour period. Each example in the dataset has several fields, including the day of the week, the timestamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label.

The class label identifies the change of the price in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours, thereby removing the impact of longer-term price trends. The data was normalized to facilitate analysis.

Attribute information includes the date, which ranges from May 1996 to December 1998; the day of the week; the period, which represents the time of the measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours; the New South Wales electricity price; the New South Wales electricity demand; the Victoria electricity price; the Victoria electricity demand; and the scheduled electricity transfer between both states.

This dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark and is commonly used in machine learning and computer systems applications.
