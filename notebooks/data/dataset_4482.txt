APS Failure Seed Two Dataset with Two Thousand Rows and Ten Classes 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the APS Failure dataset, which contains forty-one thousand one hundred thirty-eight samples. The subsampling process was performed using a random seed of two, and the resulting dataset has two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns.

The subsampling algorithm first uniformly sampled classes from the original dataset. Since there were more than ten unique classes, the algorithm selected ten classes based on their frequency in the original dataset. It then selected the indices where one of these classes was present and filtered the data accordingly.

Next, the algorithm uniformly sampled columns from the filtered data. Since there were more than one hundred columns, it randomly chose one hundred column indices and selected the corresponding columns.

Finally, the algorithm stratified the data according to the target variable and randomly sampled two thousand rows while maintaining the class distribution.

Features include various sensor readings, such as acceleration, temperature, and pressure, among others.
