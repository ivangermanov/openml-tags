This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target. 

The dataset covers various topics in medicinal chemistry and drug design, including carbolenes, melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), PDGFR inhibitors, toxicology, biodegradability of compounds, structure-function relationships of proteins, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The data comes from numerous published studies in journals such as Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science, Chemosphere, Protein Engineering, and others. The research spans topics like molecular descriptors, artificial neural networks, pharmacological evaluation, molecular modeling, weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors, predictive toxicology, and multivariate pattern recognition.

Many of the studies focus on developing models and methods for predicting various properties of chemical compounds, such as melting points, biological activity, toxicity, and biodegradability. These models often utilize molecular descriptors and statistical methods to establish relationships between chemical structures and their properties or activities.

The dataset includes a large number of features, likely representing various molecular descriptors and properties of the compounds being studied. These features are used in the development and validation of predictive models in drug design and related fields.
