The QSAR-TID-20129 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20129. This dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used for any purpose.

Scraped data includes information about Calpain One, a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as Calcium-Activated Neutral Proteinase One, Calpain-One Catalytic Subunit, and Calpain-One Large Subunit. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified under enzyme/protease/cysteine protease/cysteine protease CA clan/cysteine protease C two family.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, positive regulation of cardiac muscle cell apoptotic process, protein autoprocessing, protein catabolic process, negative regulation of actin filament polymerization, receptor catabolic process, and many others. It also plays a role in cellular components such as cornified envelope, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, lysosome, cytosol, plasma membrane, and membrane.
