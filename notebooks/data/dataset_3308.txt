This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK2, and it has numerous features representing FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Demographics, education, and MTLQSAR are among the relevant tags associated with this dataset. It is part of the MetaQSAR project.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK2 is a single protein preferred name, also known as JAK2, Janus Kinase 2, or Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK2. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified under the protein target classification of enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase JakB family.

This enzyme plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including microglial cell activation, adaptive immune response, immune system process, chromatin organization, chromatin remodeling, transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein phosphorylation, and apoptotic process.
