QSAR-TID-10938 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK2, and it has rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK2, a single protein that is a preferred name for Janus Kinase 2, also known as JAK2. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and the tyrosine protein kinase JakB family. The dataset provides information about the protein's function, including its role in phosphorylation, signal transduction, and cell differentiation.

The dataset also includes information about the protein's structure, including its domains and binding sites. It provides information about the protein's interactions with other molecules, including its substrates and inhibitors. The dataset also includes information about the protein's role in various biological processes, including cell signaling, cell growth, and cell differentiation.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in studying the structure and function of Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK2, as well as its role in various biological processes. It can be used to develop new drugs that target this protein, and to understand the mechanisms of diseases that are associated with its dysfunction.
