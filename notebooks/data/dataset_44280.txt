**Meta-Album OmniPrint-MD-6 Dataset (Micro)**

The OmniPrint-MD-6 dataset consists of synthesized images from seven hundred three categories. The images are generated with OmniPrint, without any further processing. The OmniPrint synthesis parameters are as follows: font size is set, image size is specified, the strength of random perspective transformation is adjusted, left, right, top, and bottom margins are all set as a percentage of the image size, the strength of pre-rasterization elastic transformation is adjusted, random translation is activated both horizontally and vertically, image blending method is Poisson Image Editing, rotation is within a specified range, horizontal shear is within a specified range, and both foreground and background are images taken from a personal mobile phone.
