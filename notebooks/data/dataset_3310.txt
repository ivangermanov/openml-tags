Dataset Information 
The dataset comprises multiple sets of mobile sensor readings data, including humidity and temperature values, corresponding to a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles. Each set contains records in the following format: device identifier, humidity value, temperature value, experiment identifier, and sensing time. 

Additional Information 
The swarm of unmanned surface vehicles is moving according to a GPS predefined trajectory, whose relative waypoints are specified in the accompanying documentation. These vehicles are floating over the sea surface in a coastal area of Athens, Greece. For more information about this project, please visit the website.

Has Missing Values? 
No 

Additional Variable Information 
Attributes include device, which represents the unmanned surface vehicle identification; humidity, which denotes the sensed humidity value from the unmanned surface vehicle sensor; temperature, which signifies the sensed temperature value from the unmanned surface vehicle sensor; experiment, which remains constant; and time, which indicates the sensing and reporting time.
