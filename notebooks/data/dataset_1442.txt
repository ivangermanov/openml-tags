QSAR-TID-12391 Dataset: History, MTLQSAR, Social Media, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12391. It has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints from zero to nine hundred twenty-five, and more.
