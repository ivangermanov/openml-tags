Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). 

Features: The dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz through oz, followed by a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem used for various studies and mythbusting purposes. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification task by using the mean value as a threshold. Instances below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are labeled as negative. This conversion allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem. The dataset likely contains multiple input features that are used to predict the binary outcome.
