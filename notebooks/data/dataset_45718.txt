The Three Dimensional Location Estimation Using Received Signal Strength Indication of Wireless Local Area Network dataset aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning-based localization algorithm that can accurately estimate the position of a receiver based on Received Signal Strength Indication information from surrounding radio transmitters, including height information, thereby enabling the estimation of the target's three-dimensional location.

The challenge is to create a system that can pinpoint the exact location of a receiver in three-dimensional space using the signal strength data from nearby wireless transmitters. This requires the development of a sophisticated algorithm that can process the signal strength information and translate it into precise location coordinates, including the height of the receiver.

The dataset features a range of variables, including the time of data collection, geographical coordinates, and details about the wireless transmitters.
