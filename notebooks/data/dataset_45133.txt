**Child Bayesian Network**

The Child Bayesian Network is a sample network in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education.

This network has twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, representing relationships between variables related to a child's health. The network contains two hundred thirty parameters, which define the probability distributions of each node.

The average Markov blanket size is three, indicating that each node has three neighboring nodes on average. The average degree of the nodes is two point five, showing that most nodes have two or three connections.

The maximum in-degree of any node is two, meaning that no node has more than two parent nodes.

The Child Bayesian Network represents various aspects of a child's health, including medical conditions, test results, and demographic information.
