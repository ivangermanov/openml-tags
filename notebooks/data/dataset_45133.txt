**Child Bayesian Network. Sample 2.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a valuable resource for this dataset.

This Child Bayesian Network consists of twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three, and the average degree is two point five. The maximum in-degree is two.

This dataset is a representation of a probabilistic expert system, which is a powerful tool for learning and decision making.

The network features a range of variables, including Age, Cardiac Mixing, Chest X-ray, and Disease, among others. These variables are interconnected, allowing for the modeling of complex relationships and probabilistic dependencies.
