Name: GNFUV Pi Four
Tags: Images, Life Science Test

Dataset Information:
The dataset comprises four sets of mobile sensor readings data, including humidity and temperature values, corresponding to a swarm of four Unmanned Surface Vehicles. Each set of data contains records in the following format: Unmanned Surface Vehicle Identification Number; Humidity Value; Temperature Value; Experiment Identification Number; Sensing Time.

The swarm of Unmanned Surface Vehicles is moving according to a predefined Global Positioning System trajectory, whose relative waypoints are specified in the Read Me document. The Unmanned Surface Vehicles are floating over the sea surface in a coastal area of Athens, Greece.

Has Missing Values? No

Additional Variable Information:
Attributes include the following:

* Device refers to the Unmanned Surface Vehicle Identification Number, which is a string value.
* Humidity represents the sensed humidity value from the Unmanned Surface Vehicle sensor, which is a real value.
* Temperature represents the sensed temperature value from the Unmanned Surface Vehicle sensor, which is also a real value.
* Experiment is a constant real value, specifically one.
* Time refers to the sensing and reporting time, which is a real value.
