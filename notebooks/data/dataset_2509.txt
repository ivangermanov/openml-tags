STL-10

The STL-10 dataset is a variation of the CIFAR-10 dataset, but with some significant modifications. Each class has fewer labeled training examples compared to CIFAR-10, but a massive set of unlabeled examples is provided to facilitate learning image models prior to supervised training. The primary challenge lies in leveraging the unlabeled data, which originates from a similar yet distinct distribution compared to the labeled data, to establish a useful prior.

We anticipate that the higher resolution of this dataset, which stands at ninety-six by ninety-six pixels, will pose a formidable benchmark for developing more scalable unsupervised learning methods. The dataset comprises ten classes, including airplane, bird, car, cat, deer, dog, horse, monkey, ship, and truck. 

Images are colored and have a resolution of ninety-six by ninety-six pixels. There are five hundred training images, divided into ten predefined folds, as well as eight hundred test images per class. Additionally, there are one hundred thousand unlabeled images available for unsupervised learning purposes. 

These unlabeled examples are derived from a broader yet similar distribution of images, encompassing other types of animals, such as bears and rabbits, and vehicles, including trains and buses, beyond those present in the labeled set. The images were sourced from labeled examples on ImageNet.
