Many individuals struggle to obtain loans due to insufficient or nonexistent credit histories. Unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience.

In order to ensure that this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit utilizes a variety of alternative data, including telecommunications and transactional information, to predict their clients' repayment abilities. While Home Credit is currently employing various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they are challenging data scientists to help them unlock the full potential of their data.

Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are granted with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
