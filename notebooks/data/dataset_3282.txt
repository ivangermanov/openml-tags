QSAR-TID-11758 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11758. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 213 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is Glucagon-like Peptide 1 Receptor, a single protein that belongs to the family B G protein-coupled receptor. It is a peptide receptor that plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis and is a potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The receptor is expressed in the pancreas, stomach, and brain, and its activation stimulates the release of insulin and inhibits the release of glucagon, thereby reducing blood glucose levels.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for the development of novel therapeutic agents that target the Glucagon-like Peptide 1 Receptor.
