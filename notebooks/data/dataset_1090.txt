BNG Dataset: Artificial Lymphatic System Model 

Tags: Artificial, BNG, Chemistry, Life Science 

Features: 

The model focuses on the Lymphatic System, specifically the Block of Afferent Lymphatic Capillaries and Block of Lymph Sinusoids. 
It also explores the concept of By-Pass and how substances Extravasate into the system. 
Additionally, the model examines the process of Regeneration of Lymph Nodes and Early Uptake in the Lymphatic System. 
Furthermore, it delves into the changes that occur in Lymph Node dimensions, including Diminution and Enlargement. 
The model also investigates Changes in Lymph Node Structure and any Defects that may arise in the nodes. 
Moreover, it analyzes Changes in Lymphatic Vessel Structure and Special Forms of Lymphatic Vessels. 
Lastly, it touches upon Dislocation of Lymph Nodes and Exclusion of Non-functional Nodes, as well as the Number of Nodes present.
