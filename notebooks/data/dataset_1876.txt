QSAR-TID-19624 Tags: Earth Science, Meteorology, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19624. It has fifty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The features include molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, and median PX fifty.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
