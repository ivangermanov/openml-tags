Water Treatment Dataset

Title: Faults in an Urban Waste Water Treatment Plant

Source Information:
The dataset comes from the daily measures of sensors in an urban waste water treatment plant.

Past Usage:
The dataset was previously used to compare the classification of plant situations using cluster analysis and conceptual clustering. It was also used to develop a classification methodology for ill-structured domains and to diagnose waste water treatment plant problems.

Relevant Information:
This dataset aims to classify the operational state of the plant in order to predict faults through the state variables of the plant at each stage of the treatment process. The domain has been stated as an ill-structured domain.

Number of Instances: 
Number of Attributes:

Attribute Information:
All attributes are numeric and continuous. They include input flow to the plant, input zinc to the plant, input pH to the plant, input biological demand of oxygen to the plant, input chemical demand of oxygen to the plant, input suspended solids to the plant, input volatile suspended solids to the plant, input sediments to the plant, input conductivity to the plant, and others.

Missing Attribute Values:
There are several missing values in the dataset, which are represented as unknown information.

Class Distribution:
The dataset includes thirteen classes, which are normal situation, secondary settler problems one, secondary settler problems two, secondary settler problems three, normal situation with performance over the mean, solids overload one, secondary settler problems four, storm one, normal situation with low influent, storm two, normal situation, storm three, and solids overload two.
