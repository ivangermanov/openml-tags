**MetaQSAR Project - September 2015**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred sixty-three, and it has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI fifty.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID, Fixed Count Fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four zero, ... (skipped due to readability issues)
