QSAR-TID-11109 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Three, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP Six One Zero Two Four Zero, FCFP Six One Zero Two Four One, FCFP Six One Zero Two Four Two, and many more.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Three is a single protein, also known as Stromelysin One, Matrix Metalloproteinase Three, MMP Three, MMP-Three, SL-One, STMY One, and many more. It is an enzyme, a protease, a metallo protease, and a metallo protease MAM clan, and a metallo protease M Ten A subfamily.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version Seventeen.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Three is a target for several compounds, including CTS One Zero Two Seven, which is a small molecule and a Matrix Metalloproteinase Three inhibitor, and Marimastat, which is also a small molecule and a Matrix Metalloproteinase Three inhibitor.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Three is involved in several biological processes, including immune system process, proteolysis, extracellular matrix disassembly, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, and many more. It is also involved in several cellular components, including extracellular region, extracellular space, nucleus, cytoplasm, and extracellular matrix.
