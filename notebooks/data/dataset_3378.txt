This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Melatonin Receptor One A, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Melatonin Receptor One A.

Melatonin Receptor One A is a single protein preferred name, also known as Mel-One-A-R, Mel one a receptor, Melatonin Receptor Type One A, and MTNR one A. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor small molecule receptor family A GPCR monoamine derivative receptor family A GPCR.

It is described as being involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway coupled to cyclic nucleotide second messenger, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, mating behavior, and circadian rhythm.
