QSAR-TID-11084 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11084. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Melatonin receptor one A, which is a single protein target. The Melatonin receptor one A is a type of G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in various physiological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and circadian rhythm.

The dataset is also related to various Gene Ontology terms, including plasma membrane, membrane, receptor complex, G protein-coupled receptor activity, protein binding, melatonin receptor activity, hormone binding, and organic cyclic compound binding.
