QSAR-TID-11430 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11430. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Dopamine D3 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as D(3) dopamine receptor, Dopamine D3 receptor, and Drd3. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, dopamine receptor signaling pathway, and response to amphetamine.

The dataset provides information about the receptor's function, including its role in regulating dopamine secretion, locomotory behavior, and response to xenobiotic stimulus. It also includes information about the receptor's structure, including its plasma membrane localization and its involvement in endocytic vesicle formation.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Dopamine D3 receptor. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data, which can be used to identify potential lead compounds and to optimize their activity.
