Diabetes Bayesian Network. Sample Eight.

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. It is a discrete very large network comprising four hundred thirteen nodes and six hundred two arcs. The total number of parameters in this network is approximately four hundred twenty-nine thousand four hundred nine. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point ninety-seven, while the average degree is around two point ninety-two. The maximum in-degree of this network is two.

This Diabetes Bayesian Network was developed using a model-based approach to insulin adjustment. This approach has been presented in a research paper titled "A Model-Based Approach to Insulin Adjustment", which was published in the Proceedings of the Third Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.

The network represents various factors related to diabetes, including meal intake, carbohydrate levels, insulin absorption, glucose production, and renal clearance. These factors are interconnected through a complex web of relationships, allowing for the modeling of different scenarios and prediction of outcomes.

Some of the key factors represented in this network include meal composition, carbohydrate balance, insulin sensitivity, glucose production rate, and renal clearance rate. By modeling these factors and their interactions, this network provides a powerful tool for understanding and managing diabetes.
