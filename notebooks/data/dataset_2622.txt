The Container Pre-Marshalling Problem Dataset is an extension of the previous dataset, which includes a broader range of features and a new set of test instances. There are three distinct groups of features: the first set encompasses the complete array of features derived from the second iteration of the Latent Feature Analysis process; the second set comprises only the features resulting from the initial iteration of this process; and the third set consists of the original features utilized in the Premarshalling-Astar-2013 dataset.

In addition to these feature sets, corresponding test data is provided, adhering to an identical naming convention. It is worth noting that the calculation of features for the Premarshalling Problem is exceptionally straightforward and rapid, thereby rendering the feature costs file unnecessary.

This dataset offers a comprehensive collection of features, including instance identification, repetition, number of stacks, tiers, stack-to-tier ratio, container density, percentage of empty stacks, overstowing stacks, and various measures of group similarity and top-good containers.

Algorithm selection benchmarking is facilitated through the provision of algorithm and runtime data, enabling researchers to assess the performance of different algorithms on this problem.
