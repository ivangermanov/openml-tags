QSAR-TID-10617 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10617. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10617. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is capable of generating fingerprints without requiring missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. The project is focused on providing high-quality data, which can be used for various applications, including drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target is a single protein, specifically Pepsin A, which is an aspartic protease. It has various synonyms, including Pepsin A PGA, and is classified under the enzyme/protease/aspartic protease/Aspartic protease AA clan/Aspartic protease A1A subfamily category.

The dataset also contains information about the target's gene ontology, including its cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The target is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and digestion, and has molecular functions such as aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.
