The QSAR-TID-10617 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10617, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero six one seven.

The features represent FCFP fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains multiple features including molecule ChEMBL ID, and median PXc fifty. The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule, while the median PXc fifty represents the activity value of each compound on the drug target.

The data also includes information about the protein target classification, which belongs to the enzyme protease aspartic protease aspartic protease AA clan aspartic protease A one A subfamily. Additionally, it provides information about the protein function, which includes aspartic type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.

Furthermore, the data provides information about the biological process, which includes proteolysis and digestion. It also includes information about the cellular component, which is the extracellular region.
