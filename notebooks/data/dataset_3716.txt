This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine- and Threonine-Specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase, also known as Membrane-Associated Tyrosine- and Threonine-Specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase, MYT1, Myt1 Kinase, or PKMYT1.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It consists of eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides information about the target protein, including its synonyms, classification, description, and relationships.

Tyrosine- and Threonine-Specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase is a single protein, classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, belonging to the other protein kinase group and WEE family.

It is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity, G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, regulation of mitotic nuclear division, phosphorylation, and meiotic cell cycle.

The protein is located in the Golgi membrane, nucleus, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, and membrane.

Keywords: QSAR, Tyrosine- and Threonine-Specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase, drug target, molecular fingerprints, protein kinase, cell cycle, protein phosphorylation, biological processes.
