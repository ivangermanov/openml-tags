QSAR-TID-30033 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine- and Threonine-specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine- and Threonine-specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The drug target Tyrosine- and Threonine-specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase is also known as Membrane-associated Tyrosine- and Threonine-specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase, MYT1, Myt1 Kinase, and PKMYT1. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, specifically an other protein kinase group, and an other protein kinase WEE family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in Tyrosine- and Threonine-specific CDC2-Inhibitory Kinase.
