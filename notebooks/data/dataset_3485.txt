The QSAR-TID-11199 dataset, tagged with Economics, Life Science, and MTLQSAR, is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015. This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11199. It consists of one hundred four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains information about molecules, specifically their chemical structure, and how they interact with a particular protein, Elastase two A, also known as CELA two A or Chymotrypsin-like elastase family member two A. Elastase two A is an enzyme that breaks down proteins and is involved in various biological processes.

The dataset provides information about the expression of this protein in different organisms, its function, and its role in various biological pathways. It also includes information about the protein's structure and how it interacts with other molecules.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, Elastase two A, protein-ligand interactions, biological pathways, enzyme activity.
