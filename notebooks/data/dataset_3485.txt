Within Project Defect Prediction for Ansible
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning
Context
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a DevOps strategy that enables the management and provisioning of infrastructure through the definition of machine-readable files and automation around them, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Although IaC represents an increasingly widely adopted practice, little is known about how to best maintain, swiftly evolve, and continuously improve the code behind the IaC strategy in a measurable manner.

On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate different quality aspects of the software developed. In particular, Infrastructure as Code is simply "code," as such it is prone to defects as any other programming language. This dataset targets the YAML-based Ansible language to devise defect prediction approaches for IaC based on Machine Learning.

Content
The dataset contains metrics extracted from open-source GitHub repositories based on the Ansible language that satisfied certain criteria. These include the presence of recent pushes, multiple releases, a significant number of IaC scripts, core contributors, continuous integration practices, comments ratio, commit frequency, issue frequency, and licenses.

Metrics are grouped into three categories: IaC-oriented metrics of structural properties derived from the source code of infrastructure scripts; Delta metrics that capture the amount of change in a file between two successive releases, collected for each IaC-oriented metric; and Process metrics that capture aspects of the development process rather than aspects about the code itself.

Inspiration
What source code properties and properties about the development process are good predictors of defects in Infrastructure as Code scripts?
