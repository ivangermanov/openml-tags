FlyCraft Demonstrations is a dataset consisting of demonstrations generated by the Iterative Regularized Policy Optimization with Imperfect Demonstrations algorithm for FlyCraft. This dataset has been augmented based on the symmetry of the state chi feature. The dataset includes a range of features, including the state timestamp, state roll, state pitch, state yaw, state velocity, state mu, state chi, state p, state height, goal velocity, goal mu, goal chi, action p, action nz, and action pla.
