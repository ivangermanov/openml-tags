Tamilnadu Electricity Board Hourly Readings dataset is a time series dataset that contains real-time readings collected from residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors to find the accuracy of consumption in Tamil Nadu, around Thanjavur.

The dataset has undergone major changes, specifically ignoring variable three, which seemed to be a perfect predictor. The attribute Sector was removed from the original source since it was constant for all instances. Additionally, the attribute Service ID should be removed when predicting the target from Voltage-Ampere readings and Wattage readings.

The dataset contains the following attributes: Voltage-Ampere readings, Wattage readings, and Type, which is a class attribute that categorizes the readings into various sectors such as Bank, Automobile Industry, BPO Industry, Cement Industry, Farmers, Health Care Resources, Textile Industry, Poultry Industry, Residential (individual), Residential (Apartments), Food Industry, Chemical Industry, Handlooms, Fertilizer Industry, Hostel, Hospital, Supermarket, Theatre, and University.

Keywords: Tamilnadu Electricity Board, Hourly Readings, Time Series, Energy Consumption, Voltage-Ampere Readings, Wattage Readings, Industrial Sectors.
