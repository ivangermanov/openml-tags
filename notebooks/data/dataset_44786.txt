Name: Porto Seguro Seed Three Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Porto Seguro dataset with seed three

This dataset is a subsample of the original Porto Seguro dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset that retains the essential characteristics of the original dataset.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several parameters, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a flag for stratification. The function uses the NumPy random number generator to select the classes, columns, and rows to include in the subsample.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including various indicators, registers, car features, and calculation features. These features are a subset of the original features in the Porto Seguro dataset.

The dataset was generated with the goal of creating a smaller, more manageable dataset that can be used for machine learning and data analysis tasks.
