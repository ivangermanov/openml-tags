Porto Seguro Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This dataset is a subsampling of the Porto Seguro dataset with a seed of three. It has been generated using specific arguments, including two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratification argument is set to true.

The dataset has undergone uniform sampling of classes, columns, and rows. The class sampling was done by selecting ten classes out of the total unique classes, ensuring that each class had an equal probability of being chosen. The column sampling involved uniformly selecting one hundred columns out of the total columns available.

If the number of rows exceeded two thousand, stratified sampling was used to select the desired number of rows. This ensured that the sampled rows maintained the same class distribution as the original dataset. 

Features include various indicators, registers, car-related variables, calculation variables, and a target variable.
