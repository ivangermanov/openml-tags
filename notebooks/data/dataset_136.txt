**Low Birth Weight Data**

Tags: Health, Medicine

The goal of this study was to identify risk factors associated with giving birth to a low birth weight baby, which is defined as weighing less than two thousand five hundred grams. Data were collected on one hundred eighty-nine women, fifty-nine of whom had low birth weight babies and one hundred thirty of whom had normal birth weight babies.

Four variables that were thought to be of importance were the mother's age, her weight at her last menstrual period, her race, and the number of physician visits she made during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The data were collected at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, during nineteen eighty-six.

This dataset consists of the complete data. A paired dataset created from this low birth weight data may be found separately, as well as a three-to-one matched dataset.

**Code Sheet for the Variables in the Low Birth Weight Data Set**

* Identification Code
* Low Birth Weight (whether the birth weight was less than two thousand five hundred grams)
* Age of the Mother in Years
* Weight in Pounds at the Last Menstrual Period
* Race (whether the mother was white, black, or other)
* Smoking Status During Pregnancy (whether the mother smoked during pregnancy)
* History of Premature Labor (the number of times the mother had premature labor)
* History of Hypertension (whether the mother had hypertension)
* Presence of Uterine Irritability (whether the mother had uterine irritability)
* Number of Physician Visits During the First Trimester (the number of times the mother visited a physician during the first trimester)
* Birth Weight in Grams

These data have been used as an example of fitting a multiple logistic regression model. The story behind the data is that low birth weight is an outcome that has been of concern to physicians for years because infant mortality rates and birth defect rates are very high for low birth weight babies. A woman's behavior during pregnancy, including her diet, smoking habits, and receiving prenatal care, can greatly alter the chances of carrying the baby to term and, consequently, of delivering a baby of normal birth weight.
