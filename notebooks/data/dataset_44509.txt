APS Failure Seed One Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the APS Failure dataset with seed one

This dataset is a subsample of the APS Failure dataset, which has been reduced to two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsampling was done using a stratified approach to ensure that the classes are represented proportionally.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several parameters, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a flag for stratification. The function uses the NumPy random number generator to select the classes, columns, and rows.

The original dataset had over forty-one thousand rows, but this subsample has been reduced to two thousand rows to make it more manageable. The number of columns has also been reduced from the original number to one hundred. The classes have been selected using a stratified approach to ensure that they are represented proportionally.

The dataset contains a variety of features, including acoustic, acceleration, and vibration features. These features have been selected from the original dataset to provide a representative sample of the data.
