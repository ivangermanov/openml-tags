Life Science and Machine Learning Context: Technical Indicator Backtest

Using the TA-Lib Technical Analysis Library, this project involves backtesting on the SPY Index data, employing support and resistance indicators or alternative indicators.

The content data consists of daily SPY Index information, featuring the following components:

* Date
* Open Price
* Highest Price
* Lowest Price
* Closing Price
* Adjusted Closing Price
* Trading Volume

Acknowledgments: The concept of Support and Resistance draws inspiration from Technical Analysis Wikipedia page.

This project aims to meticulously implement technical indicators and conduct a comprehensive backtest to achieve optimal results.
