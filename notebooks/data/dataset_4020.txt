QSAR-TID-11225 Dataset Information:

The QSAR-TID-11225 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11225. This dataset has 2585 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

Features:

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Dataset Description:

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset contains information about the chemical structures and their corresponding activities against the target protein, Renin.

Target Information:

Renin, also known as Angiotensinogenase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. It is a single protein target with multiple synonyms, including Angiotensinogenase REN and Renin. The preferred name for this target is Renin.

Organism:

The target protein, Renin, is from the species Homo sapiens.

Classification:

Renin is classified as an enzyme, specifically an aspartic protease, belonging to the Aspartic protease A1A subfamily.

Description:

Renin is involved in various biological processes, including kidney development, mesonephros development, angiotensin maturation, and regulation of blood volume by the renin-angiotensin system. It is also associated with certain diseases, such as hyperuricemic nephropathy, familial juvenile 2.
