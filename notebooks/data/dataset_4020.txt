QSAR-TID-11225 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11225. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has 2585 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The drug target is Renin, also known as Angiotensinogenase, which is a single protein. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protease family and is involved in the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure.

The dataset contains information about the compounds, including their mechanism of action, maximum phase, and first approval. It also includes information about the target, such as its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description.

The dataset is related to various biological processes, including kidney development, mesonephros development, angiotensin maturation, and regulation of blood volume by renin-angiotensin.
