Timing Attack Dataset: Twenty-Five Micro Seconds Delay Created on Nineteen September Two Thousand Twenty-Two

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

Bleichenbacher Timing Attack: This dataset was created to analyze the Bleichenbacher timing attack, which is a type of attack used to exploit vulnerabilities in secure communication protocols.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset contains attributes related to three types of messages: Change Cipher Spec, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect. Each message type has several attributes that describe its characteristics, such as source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, and flags.

Change Cipher Spec Messages:
These messages have attributes that include source port, destination port, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flags, nonce flags, congestion window reduced flags, ECN-echo flags, urgent flags, acknowledgment flags, push flags, reset flags, syn flags, fin flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options NOP, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and order.

TLS Alert Messages:
These messages have attributes that include source port, destination port, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flags, nonce flags, congestion window reduced flags, ECN-echo flags, urgent flags, acknowledgment flags, push flags, reset flags, syn flags, fin flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options NOP, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and order.

TCP Disconnect Messages:
These messages have attributes that include source port, destination port, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flags, nonce flags, congestion window reduced flags, ECN-echo flags, urgent flags, acknowledgment flags, push flags, reset flags, syn flags, fin flags, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options NOP, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and order.

Features:
The dataset includes several features that can be used for analysis, including source ports, destination ports, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, header lengths, flags, window sizes, checksum statuses, urgent pointers, options, and timestamps.
