It includes features such as actual time spent online, age, community building activities, community memberships, country of residence, disabilities, educational attainment, falsification of information, gender, household income, how respondents heard about the survey, geographical location, occupation, marital status, opinions on important internet issues and censorship, primary computing platform, language, place of web access, race, reasons for not purchasing online, voter registration status, sexual preference, web ordering habits, web page creation, and who pays for internet access.
