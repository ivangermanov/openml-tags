This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12725. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset includes various features, such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The target protein is matriptase, also known as membrane-type serine protease one, MT-SP one, prostamin, and PRSS fourteen. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S one A subfamily.

Matriptase is involved in various biological processes, including neural tube closure, proteolysis, protein catabolic process, keratinocyte differentiation, and epithelial cell morphogenesis involved in placental branching. It is located in the extracellular space, plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, membrane, and basolateral plasma membrane.

Matriptase has various functions, including serine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It is related to various diseases, including ichthyosis with hypotrichosis and colon carcinoma.
