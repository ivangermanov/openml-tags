The Daily Electric Energy Dataset involves predicting the daily average price of electricity energy in Spain. This dataset contains real values from two thousand three about the daily consumption in Spain of energy from various sources including hydroelectric, nuclear electric, coal, fuel, natural gas, and other special sources of energy. Unfortunately, there are some missing values.

This dataset consists of seven attributes:

One. Hydroelectric energy consumption, which ranges from a minimum value to a maximum value.

Two. Nuclear energy consumption, which also ranges from a minimum value to a maximum value.

Three. Coal energy consumption, which similarly has a range of minimum to maximum values.

Four. Fuel energy consumption, whose values span from zero to a maximum value.

Five. Gas energy consumption, which also spans from zero to a maximum value.

Six. Special energy consumption, whose values fall within a certain range.

Seven. Total energy consumption, which has a specific range of values.
