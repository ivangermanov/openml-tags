This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex USD/JPY pair obtained from Dukascopy's Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a one-minute candlestick, and the entire dataset spans from January to December. Since the Forex market is not active on weekends, there is no data for those days. The timestamp feature is based on the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean close price between the current and subsequent minutes. Specifically, if the mean close price increases in the next minute, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.

* Timestamp: The time of the current data point based on the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.
