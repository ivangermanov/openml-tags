This dataset, Eighty Years of Canadian Climate Data, has been compiled from public sources. The dataset consists of daily temperatures and precipitation from thirteen Canadian centers. Precipitation is either rain or snow, likely snow in winter months. In the early years, there is daily data for seven out of the thirteen centers, but by the mid-century mark, there is daily data from all thirteen centers, with the occasional missing value. Few of Canada's weather stations have been operating continuously, so we did need to patch together the data. Our source data is from the Government of Canada's climate data website, and we queried the following weather stations: Calgary International Airport, Edmonton International Airport, Halifax Stanfield International Airport, Moncton Airport, Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, Ottawa International Airport, Quebec Jean Lesage International Airport, Saskatoon Diefenbaker International Airport, St John's Airport, Toronto International Airport, Vancouver International Airport, Whitehorse Airport, and Winnipeg Richardson International Airport.

The data is suitable for time series forecasting. This dataset can be used to demonstrate outlier detection, or anomaly detection, in multiple time series. 

The dataset features daily climate data from thirteen Canadian centers, including mean temperature and total precipitation for each center.
