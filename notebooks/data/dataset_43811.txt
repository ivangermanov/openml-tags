Eighty Years of Canadian Climate Data 

Tags: This dataset has been compiled from public sources.

This dataset consists of daily temperatures and precipitation from thirteen Canadian centers. Precipitation is either rain or snow, likely snow in winter months. In the early years of data collection, there was daily data for seven out of the thirteen centers, but by the mid-period, there was daily data from all thirteen centers, with the occasional missing value. Few of Canada's weather stations have been operating continuously, so we had to patch together the data.

Our source data is from the official government website, which provides climate data, and we queried the following weather stations: Calgary International Airport, Edmonton International Airport, Halifax Stanfield International Airport, Moncton Airport, Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, Ottawa International Airport, Quebec Jean Lesage International Airport, Saskatoon Diefenbaker International Airport, St John's Airport, Toronto International Airport, Vancouver International Airport, Whitehorse Airport, and Winnipeg Richardson International Airport.

The suggested use of this dataset is for time series forecasting. Additionally, this dataset is suitable for demonstrating outlier detection, also known as anomaly detection, in multiple time series.
