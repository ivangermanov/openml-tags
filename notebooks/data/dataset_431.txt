This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies include research on carbolenes, melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity descriptors, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro and bromoalkenes, single-point mutants of haloalkane dehalogenase, structure-function and structure-stability relationships of purposely modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The datasets cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, including melting points, toxicity, biodegradability, enzyme activity, protein stability, and drug efficacy. Various computational methods and statistical approaches are employed in these studies, such as artificial neural networks, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), and multivariate pattern recognition.

These datasets provide valuable resources for researchers in the fields of medicinal chemistry, toxicology, environmental science, and computational biology. They can be used to develop and validate predictive models for various molecular properties and biological activities.
