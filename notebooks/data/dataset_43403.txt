Indian Liver Patient Records with K-Folds (5-Folds)

Context:
Liver disease is a growing concern in India, primarily due to the excessive consumption of alcohol and other harmful substances present in the air, food items, or drugs. This dataset is created to facilitate predictive analysis of liver disease, thereby reducing the burden on doctors.

Content:
This dataset contains patient records, including 416 liver patient records and 167 non-liver patient records, collected from the North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column serves as a class label, dividing groups into liver patients (with liver disease) or non-liver patients (without disease). The dataset comprises 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

The dataset has undergone preprocessing, filling missing values with the average value of the respective columns. Additionally, the data has been divided into five K-Folds using stratified K-Folds, considering the imbalance in the data.

Columns:
The dataset includes columns for the patient's age, gender, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total proteins, albumin, albumin and globulin ratio, and a target variable indicating whether the patient has liver disease (1) or not (0).
