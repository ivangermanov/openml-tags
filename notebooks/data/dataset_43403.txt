Indian Liver Patient Records Dataset 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Liver disease cases in India are increasing at an alarming rate due to the excessive consumption of alcohol and other harmful substances present in the air, food items, or drugs. To address this growing concern, this dataset has been created for predictive analysis of liver disease to reduce the burden on medical professionals.

This comprehensive dataset contains patient records and non-patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column serves as a class label to categorize individuals into two distinct groups: those suffering from liver disease and those without any liver-related ailments.

The dataset comprises a significant number of male and female patient records, providing a representative sample of the population. Moreover, this dataset has undergone rigorous preprocessing to ensure that all missing values have been filled with the average value of their respective columns. Additionally, the data has been divided into five folds using stratified K-folds, taking into account the inherent imbalance in the data.

The dataset includes various attributes, including the age of the patient, gender, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total proteins, albumin, and albumin and globulin ratio. These attributes play a crucial role in predicting liver disease, enabling medical professionals to make informed decisions.

The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the prediction of liver disease, thereby alleviating the burden on medical professionals. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced analytical techniques, researchers and practitioners can develop accurate models to identify individuals at risk of developing liver disease.
