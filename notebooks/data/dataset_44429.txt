Subsampling of the dataset Jannis with seed one, where the maximum number of rows is two thousand, the maximum number of columns is one hundred, and the maximum number of classes is ten, and stratification is set to false. 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility. 

First, it uniformly samples classes from the dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. 

Next, it uniformly samples columns from the dataset, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum number of columns. 

Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution is preserved. 

The resulting dataset is then returned, along with the categorical mask and column names.
