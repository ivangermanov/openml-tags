Dataset Name: Jannis Seed One 

Tags: Chemistry, Earth Science 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Jannis dataset, which has been reduced in size to facilitate easier handling and analysis. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows.

The resulting dataset has been generated using a specific set of parameters, including a random seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, and maximum number of classes. The stratification option has also been enabled to ensure that the resulting dataset maintains a representative distribution of classes.

The dataset features have been selected from the original set, with a focus on retaining a diverse range of variables. These features include various chemical and earth science-related properties.

The subsampling process has been implemented using a Python function, which utilizes NumPy and Pandas libraries to perform the necessary operations. The function takes into account the specified parameters and ensures that the resulting dataset meets the desired criteria.
