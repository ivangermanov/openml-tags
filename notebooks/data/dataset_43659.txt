The Price and Sales of Avocado

Tags: Context

The database update for the Avocado Prices dataset was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in January of two thousand and twenty. This dataset contains a wealth of information about avocado sales, including the date of each observation, the average sales price of the current year, and the total volume of avocados sold.

The dataset also breaks down the total volume of avocados sold into different categories, including the number of avocados with specific price look-up codes, such as four zero four six, four two two five, and four seven seven zero. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the type of avocado, whether it is conventional or organic, as well as the year and region of the observation.

The Hass Avocado Board is to be commended for sharing this valuable data, which provides a unique insight into the avocado market.
