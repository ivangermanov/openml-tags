Insurance Premium Data Tags: This dataset, which I stumbled upon online, is an excellent resource for practicing regression models. It is an openly available online dataset that can be found at multiple locations. Although I am not aware of the exact origin and collection methodology of the data, I highly recommend this dataset to everyone who is just beginning their journey in data science.

The dataset features include age, sex, body mass index, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.
