Life Science, Machine Learning, MTL QSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one sixteen oh six, and it has twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.

This dataset contains QSAR data scraped from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target carboxypeptidase B. 

Carboxypeptidase B is a single protein also known as carboxypeptidase B CPB CPB one belonging to the metallo protease M fourteen A subfamily. It is found in the extracellular region and cytoplasmic vesicle and is involved in proteolysis. 

It has peptidase activity, metallocarboxypeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. It is also known to bind zinc ions.
