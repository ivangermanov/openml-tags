QSAR-TID-11141 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11141. The dataset has thirty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11141. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has thirty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and other machine learning applications.

The dataset contains information about the Glucagon receptor, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is classified as a family B G protein-coupled receptor and a peptide receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, glucose homeostasis, and response to starvation.

The dataset also contains information about the protein target classification, which is a one membrane receptor and a family B G protein-coupled receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, glucose homeostasis, and response to starvation.
