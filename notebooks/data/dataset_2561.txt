The Jura dataset consists of measurements of concentrations of seven heavy metals, including Cadmium, Cobalt, Chromium, Copper, Nickel, Lead, and Zinc, recorded at multiple locations in the topsoil of a region of the Swiss Jura. The type of land use, including Forest, Pasture, Meadow, and Tillage, and rock type, including Argovian, Kimmeridgian, Sequanian, Portlandian, and Quaternary, were also recorded for each location.

In a typical scenario, we are interested in predicting the concentration of metals that are more expensive to measure, known as primary variables, using measurements of metals that are cheaper to sample, known as secondary variables. In this study, Cadmium, Copper, and Lead are treated as target variables, while the remaining metals, along with land use type, rock type, and the coordinates of each location, are used as predictive features.
