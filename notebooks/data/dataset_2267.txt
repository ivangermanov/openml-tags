This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Renal Dipeptidase, and it has twenty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is from the MetaQSAR project, September two thousand fifteen.
