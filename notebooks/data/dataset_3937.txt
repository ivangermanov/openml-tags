QSAR-TID-11718 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11718. The dataset has twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the chemical structure of compounds.

The features in the dataset are primarily composed of molecular fingerprints, which are binary vectors that encode the presence or absence of specific substructures in a molecule. These fingerprints are used as inputs to machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target.

The dataset is related to the Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha, which is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including virtual screening, lead optimization, and target validation. It can also be used to develop machine learning models that predict the activity of compounds against the Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha.
