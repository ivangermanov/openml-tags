QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and various FCFP fingerprints. The target protein is Glycogen synthase kinase beta, also known as Gsk beta, GSK beta, and Serine/threonine protein kinase GSKB. It is found in Mus musculus and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase GSK family.

The protein is involved in numerous biological processes including cell cycle regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, gene expression, apoptosis, neuronal development, circadian rhythm, and Wnt signaling pathway. It is localized in various cellular components such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, centrosome, and plasma membrane.

Glycogen synthase kinase beta has multiple molecular functions including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, beta catenin binding, and tau protein binding. It participates in diverse cellular processes like protein phosphorylation, cell differentiation, axon extension, regulation of circadian rhythm, and regulation of apoptotic processes.

The protein is involved in several signaling pathways including insulin receptor signaling, TOR signaling, and canonical Wnt signaling pathway. It plays roles in stem cell differentiation, osteoblast proliferation, neuron projection development, and regulation of synaptic plasticity.
