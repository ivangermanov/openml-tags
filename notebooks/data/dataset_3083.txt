QSAR-TID-103169 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103169.

The dataset was generated from ChEMBL version seventeen.

Features of this dataset include molecule Chembl ID and median pxc fifty.

Molecule fingerprints were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
