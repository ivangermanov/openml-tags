Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset contains information from a sex survey, covering various aspects of respondents' personal lives and demographics. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, where instances are categorized as either positive or negative based on their relationship to the mean value of the target feature.

Features included in the dataset are: Marital status, Age, Years of education, Gender, Religious affiliation, Number of sexual partners, Income level, Drug use history, Same-sex relations experience, and the binary classification outcome.

The dataset is intended for use in statistical analysis and machine learning applications, particularly in the field of social science research and demographic studies. It provides a rich source of information for exploring relationships between various personal characteristics and sexual behavior.
