ARCENE Tags: UCI

ARCENE's task is to distinguish cancer versus normal patterns from mass-spectrometric data. This is a two-class classification problem with continuous input variables. This dataset is one of five datasets of the NIPS feature selection challenge.

The data were obtained from two sources: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS). All the data consist of mass-spectra obtained with the SELDI technique. The samples include patients with cancer (ovarian or prostate cancer), and healthy or control patients.

This version of the database was prepared for the NIPS variable and feature selection benchmark. ARCENE was obtained by merging three mass-spectrometry datasets to obtain enough training and test data for a benchmark. The original features indicate the abundance of proteins in human sera having a given mass value. Based on those features, one must separate cancer patients from healthy patients.

A number of distractor features called 'probes' having no predictive power were added. The order of the features and patterns were randomized. This dataset is one of five datasets used in the NIPS feature selection challenge.

The features include numerous variables labeled V followed by a number, ranging from V to V, with many more unlisted variables totaling over ten thousand. These features represent various mass-spectrometry measurements and include both genuine predictive features and non-predictive probe features.
