This dataset is a two-class classification problem with continuous input variables, where the task is to distinguish cancer versus normal patterns from mass-spectrometric data.

The dataset was obtained by merging three mass-spectrometry datasets to obtain enough training and test data for a benchmark. The original features indicate the abundance of proteins in human sera having a given mass value. Based on these features, one must separate cancer patients from healthy patients.

A number of distractor features, called probes, having no predictive power were added. The order of the features and patterns were randomized. This dataset is one of five datasets used in the feature selection challenge.
