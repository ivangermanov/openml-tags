AutoUniv Dataset 

Abstract:
The AutoUniv dataset is an advanced data generator for classification tasks, aiming to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. It can generate data in various formats such as CSV, ARFF, or C4.5.

Data Set Information:
To create a classification model, users specify the number of attributes and their type, the number of classes, the complexity of the underlying rules, and the noise level. Then, AutoUniv produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy these requirements. A model can have multiple rules, and rare class models can be designed. Additionally, a sequence of models can be created to reflect concept and/or population drift.

Attribute Information:
Attributes can be either discrete with multiple values or continuous. Discrete attributes can be nominal or integer.

Relevant Papers:
The AutoUniv dataset has been used in various research papers, including those focusing on modeling the example life cycle in online classification learners, the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift, structure and majority classes in decision tree learning.

Features:
The dataset includes various features, each representing different characteristics of the data.
