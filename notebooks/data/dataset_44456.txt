Name: Road Safety Seed Three

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Road Safety with seed equals three

This dataset is a subsample of the original Road Safety dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of classes to ensure a maximum number of ten classes. The selected classes were chosen based on their frequency in the original dataset.

The subsample also involved uniformly sampling columns from the original dataset, selecting a subset of one hundred columns to ensure a maximum number of columns. The selected columns were chosen randomly from the original dataset.

Finally, the subsample involved stratified sampling of rows from the original dataset, selecting a subset of two thousand rows to ensure a maximum number of rows. The stratified sampling was done based on the target variable, ensuring that the subsample retained the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of features from the original Road Safety dataset, including Vehicle Type, Vehicle Manoeuvre, Vehicle Location, Hit Object in Carriageway, Hit Object off Carriageway, Was Vehicle Left Hand Drive, Age of Driver, Age Band of Driver, Engine Capacity, Propulsion Code, Age of Vehicle, Location Easting OSGR, Location Northing OSGR, Longitude, Latitude, Police Force, Number of Vehicles, Number of Casualties, Local Authority District, First Road Number, Second Road Number, Urban or Rural Area, Vehicle Reference, Casualty Reference, Sex of Casualty, Age of Casualty, Age Band of Casualty, Pedestrian Location, Pedestrian Movement, Casualty Type, Casualty IMD Decile, and Sex of Driver.
