Road Safety Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Road Safety dataset, which originally had forty-four thousand one hundred sixty-one entries. The sampling was done using a seed value of three. 

The sampling process involved several steps. Firstly, the number of classes was reduced to ten. This was achieved by selecting classes uniformly at random, with the probability of selection being proportional to the number of instances in each class. 

Next, the number of columns was reduced to one hundred. This was done by uniformly sampling column indices without replacement. 

Finally, the number of rows was reduced to two thousand. This was achieved through stratified sampling, ensuring that the class distribution in the sampled data remained similar to the original data.
