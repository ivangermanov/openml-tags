QSAR-TID-10711 Tags: Meteorology, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10711, and it has sixty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.
