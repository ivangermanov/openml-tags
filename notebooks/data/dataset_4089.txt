QSAR-TID-101211 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101211. It consists of eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.
