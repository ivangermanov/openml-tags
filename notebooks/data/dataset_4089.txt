KDD Cup 2009 Upselling Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Physical Sciences 

This dataset belongs to the classification on categorical and numerical features benchmark.

The KDD Cup 2009 offers the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider, buy new products or services, or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a key element of modern marketing strategies. In a CRM system, the most practical way to build knowledge on customer is to produce scores. A score, the output of a model, is an evaluation for all instances of a target variable to explain. The score is computed using input variables which describe instances. Scores are then used by the information system, for example, to personalize the customer relationship.

An industrial customer analysis platform able to build prediction models with a very large number of input variables has been developed by Orange Labs. This platform implements several processing methods for instances and variables selection, prediction and indexation based on an efficient model combined with variable selection regularization and model averaging method.

Upselling is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the customer purchase more expensive items, upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. Upselling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, but upselling can also be simply exposing the customer to other options they may not have considered previously.

The training set contains examples. The first predictive variables are numerical and the last predictive variables are categorical. The last target variable is binary.
