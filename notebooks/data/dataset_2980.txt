The Conventional and Social Media Movies Dataset is a collection of data featuring twelve categories of information related to movies. These categories are divided into two groups: conventional features and social media features.

The conventional features were gathered from movie databases available on the web, while the social media features were obtained from YouTube and Twitter. The dataset includes information about each movie, including its title, release year, ratings, genre, gross revenue, budget, number of screens, whether it is a sequel, sentiment analysis, views, likes, dislikes, comments, and aggregate followers.

This dataset was scraped from various sources, including Twitter, YouTube, and IMDB. It contains missing values and covers data from two specific years.
