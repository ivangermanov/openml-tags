The Egg Producing Chickens dataset is tagged with Computational Universe and Machine Learning Context. This dataset can be used without permission for the purpose of enhancing machine learning and data science. It can easily be adapted for classification, regression, and clustering.

At a practical level, such machine learning could be applied to determine which chickens are due for culling or approximating the number of eggs to be harvested.

The dataset contains various features including Breed of Chicken, Day of Observation, Age of Chicken in Weeks, Weight of Chicken in Grams, Color of Eggs, Weight of Eggs in Grams, Amount of Feed Consumed Per Day in Grams, Number of Eggs Laid Per Day, Comb Type, Sun Light Exposure in Hours, Chicken Class, Leg Shanks Color, Beak Color, Ear Lobes Color, and Plumage Color.

Acknowledgments are given to online resources including Chicken Breeds of the World, The Happy Chicken Coop, and Star Milling.

Inspiration behind creating this dataset stems from passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to contribute to the broader ecosystem and encourage active participation from the African continent.
