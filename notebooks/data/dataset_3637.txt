QSAR-TID-11617 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11617. The dataset has 309 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11617. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The dataset is related to Protein Kinase C Eta, a single protein target that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and AGC protein kinase PKC family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and cell differentiation.
