Name: Porto Seguro Seed Two Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Porto Seguro dataset with seed equals two, two thousand rows, one hundred columns, ten classes, and stratification enabled.

This dataset is a subsample of the Porto Seguro dataset, generated using a specific source code. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The Porto Seguro dataset was subsampled using a random number generator with a seed value of two. The maximum number of rows was set to two thousand, the maximum number of columns was set to one hundred, and the maximum number of classes was set to ten. Stratification was enabled to ensure that the subsample is representative of the original dataset.

The subsampling process first involves selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, a random sample of classes is selected based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices of the rows corresponding to the selected classes are then used to subset the dataset.

Next, the columns are uniformly sampled if the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns. The selected columns are then used to subset the dataset.

Finally, the rows are stratified sampled if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows. The stratification is based on the target variable, and the sample is selected using a train-test split with a test size equal to the maximum number of rows.

The resulting dataset consists of the subsampled features and target variable, along with a categorical mask indicating the categorical columns.
