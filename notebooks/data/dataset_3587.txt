This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101183. It has seventy-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September 2015. It shows the activity values of various compounds on the drug target Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1, also known as HIPK1. This protein is involved in many biological processes, including eye development, protein phosphorylation, and apoptosis.

HIPK1 is a single protein and a preferred name for this target. It has many synonyms, including Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1, KIAA0630, MYAK, and NBAK2. This protein is an enzyme, a kinase, and a protein kinase, and it belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase DYRK family.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, centrosome, cytosol, PML body, and nuclear speck. It is involved in many biological processes, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

HIPK1 is also involved in many cellular processes, including eye development, smoothened signaling pathway, cell population proliferation, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, anterior/posterior pattern specification, regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway, retina layer formation, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation, neuron differentiation, adherens junction assembly, intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage by p53 class mediator, positive regulation of angiogenesis, embryonic camera-type eye morphogenesis, embryonic retina morphogenesis in camera-type eye, definitive hemopoiesis, lens induction in camera-type eye, iris morphogenesis, endothelial cell apoptotic process, and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway.
