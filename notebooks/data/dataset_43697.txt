About Our Dataset

The journey of collecting this COVID-19 India dataset began with a competition where we were tasked with performing sentiment analysis of tweets. The data was collected from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Tweets Dataset website, which provided us with the tweet IDs of relevant tweets. To extract the tweets' text and other information, we utilized the Hydrator app.

About the Features of the Dataset

Our dataset consists of five columns. The first column, Text ID, contains a unique identifier for each tweet. The second column, Text, contains the actual tweet text corresponding to each tweet ID. The third column, Date, indicates the date on which the tweet was posted. The fourth column, Location, specifies the place from which the tweet was posted. The fifth column, Sentiments, contains the sentiment value of each tweet, which can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. If the sentiment score is greater than zero, the sentiment is positive. If the sentiment score is equal to zero, the sentiment is neutral. If the sentiment score is less than zero, the sentiment is negative.
