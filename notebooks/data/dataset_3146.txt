QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Cathepsin K, a single protein target found in Rattus norvegicus. Cathepsin K is classified as an enzyme, specifically a cysteine protease in the CA clan and C1A family. It is associated with various cellular components including the extracellular region, lysosome, plasma membrane, and intracellular membrane bounded organelles.

Cathepsin K's functions include fibronectin binding, cysteine type endopeptidase activity, collagen binding, and proteoglycan binding. It is involved in numerous biological processes such as intramembranous ossification, proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, apoptotic processes, immune response, and bone resorption.

The protein is linked to several InterPro and Pfam domains, including peptidase C1A, protease inhibitor I29, and papain like cysteine peptidase superfamily. It plays roles in cellular responses to various stimuli including zinc ion starvation, tumor necrosis factor, and transforming growth factor beta.

This comprehensive dataset provides valuable information for studying the structure activity relationships of compounds targeting Cathepsin K, which could aid in drug discovery efforts for conditions related to bone metabolism, immune responses, and proteolysis.
