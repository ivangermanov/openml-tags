This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version Seventeen. It includes eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc Fifty.

The features do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to demographics, geography, and MTLQSAR, and is part of the study three. It includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID, molecular fingerprints, and other features.

Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Six is a single protein preferred name, also known as Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase Three, MAP Kinase Six, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species Homo Sapiens and is classified under enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CMGC protein kinase group, CMGC protein kinase MAP kinase family, and CMGC protein kinase ERK Three.

It is involved in various biological processes such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein kinase binding, and protein heterodimerization activity.
