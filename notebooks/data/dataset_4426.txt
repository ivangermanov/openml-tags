Road Safety Seed One Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Road Safety dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniform sampling of classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The dataset has been subsampled using a seed value of one, with a maximum number of rows set to two thousand. The number of columns has been limited to one hundred, and the number of classes has been capped at ten. Additionally, the stratification option has been set to true, ensuring that the sampled data maintains the original class distribution.

The dataset features a range of variables related to road safety, including vehicle information, driver details, accident circumstances, and location-specific data. These features include vehicle type, vehicle maneuver, location, hit object, driver age, engine capacity, propulsion code, police force, and casualty details.
