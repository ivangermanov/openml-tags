QSAR-TID-220 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 220. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Dopamine D5 receptor, which is a protein target classified as a membrane receptor and a G protein-coupled receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, response to amphetamine, and regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and drug discovery.
