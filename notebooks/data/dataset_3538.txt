**Tags:** Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 220. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of multiple compounds with their corresponding activity values on the drug target TID: 220. The activity values are represented in pseudo-pCI50 units.

**Scraped Data**

The scraped data includes information about the Dopamine D5 receptor, which is a single protein and a preferred name for the D(1B) dopamine receptor, D1beta dopamine receptor, D(5) dopamine receptor, and Dopamine D5 receptor.

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under the category of 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family A GPCR)/Monoamine receptor/Dopamine receptor.

**Target Information**

The Dopamine D5 receptor is associated with multiple biological processes, including synaptic transmission, response to amphetamine, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, and others. It is also involved in various cellular components, such as plasma membrane, cilium, and synapse.
