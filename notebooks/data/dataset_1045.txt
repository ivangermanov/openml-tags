This dataset, known as kc1-top5, is associated with tags including mythbusting, PROMISE, and various study numbers. It is part of the PROMISE Software Engineering Repository, made publicly available to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and/or improvable predictive models of software engineering. Users publishing material based on PROMISE datasets are requested to follow the acknowledgment guidelines posted on the PROMISE repository web page.

The dataset contains class-level data for KC1, including a defect level attribute to indicate defectiveness. The defect level is marked as DEF if the module is in the top 5% in defect count ranking, and NODEF otherwise.

This data has been utilized in research investigating the effect of module size on defect prediction using static measures. The study employed various machine learning algorithms to predict defective modules in several NASA products. Observations indicated that a large portion of the modules were small, as measured by lines of code. Experiments on data subsets partitioned by module size yielded higher prediction performance for subsets including larger modules. Additionally, defect prediction using class-level data for KC1 resulted in improved performance compared to method-level data.

The dataset includes numerous features at the class level, such as percentage of public data, access to public data, coupling between objects, depth, lack of cohesion of methods, number of children, dependency on child, fan in, response for class, and weighted methods per class. It also contains features transformed from method level to class level, including various metrics related to lines of code, complexity, and Halstead metrics.

These findings suggest that quality assurance activities can be better guided if defect predictions are made using data from larger modules. The dataset provides valuable insights into software metrics and their relationship to defect prediction, which can be crucial for improving software quality and development processes.
