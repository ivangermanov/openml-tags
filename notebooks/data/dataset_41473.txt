The Yeast dataset is a multi-label dataset that consists of micro-array expression data as well as phylogenetic profiles of yeast. This dataset includes a large number of genes and a significant number of predictors. In total, there are multiple different labels that can be assigned to a gene, but due to label sparsity, only a subset of these labels were used. The dataset features a wide range of attributes, including various characteristics and properties of the genes and their phylogenetic profiles.
