Name: Pollen Tags:

This dataset is synthetic. It was generated at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. For convenience, we will refer to it as the Pollen Data. The first three variables are the lengths of geometric features observed in sampled pollen grains in the x, y, and z dimensions: a "ridge" along x, a "nub" in the y direction, and a "crack" along the z dimension. The fourth variable is pollen grain weight, and the fifth is density. There are observations, in random order. For people whose software packages cannot handle this much data, it is recommended that the data be sampled. The dataset is broken up into eight pieces, each with observations.

We will call the variables:
Ridge
Nub
Crack
Weight
Density
Observation Number (for convenience)

The data analyst is advised that there is more than one "feature" to these data. Each feature can be observed through various graphical techniques, but analytic methods, as well, can help "crack" the dataset.

The data were generated in Minitab using the following steps:
Part A was generated as five variable, uncorrelated, independent and identically distributed Gaussian observations.
To get part B, part A was duplicated, then the sign was reversed on the observations for three of the five variables.
Part B was appended to Part A.
The order of the observations was randomized.
A dot matrix representation of the word "EUREKA" was added to the "center" of the dataset.
The data were scaled by variable.
The data were rotated, then translated.
A few points in space within the data cloud were chosen as ellipsoid centers, then for each center, all observations within a scaled and rotated radius were identified and eliminated to form ellipsoidal voids.
The variables were given entirely fictitious names.

Only one group of researchers found everything, including the voids.
