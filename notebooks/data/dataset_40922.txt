Run or Walk Information

Tags: Concept Drift, Sport, Study, Time Series, Tuesday

This dataset is gathered to detect whether a person is running or walking based on deep neural networks and sensor data collected from iOS devices. The dataset represents sensor data samples collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope in ten-second intervals and a frequency of approximately five point four per second. 

The dataset is comprised of several columns, each containing sensor data for one of the sensor's axes. These columns include acceleration in the x, y, and z directions, as well as gyroscope data in the x, y, and z directions. Additionally, there is an activity type column that acts as a label, reflecting the activities of walking and running. 

The original data also contains information about the wrist where the device was placed, as well as the exact date, time, and user who collected the measurements. 

Features: acceleration in three dimensions, gyroscope data in three dimensions, activity type
