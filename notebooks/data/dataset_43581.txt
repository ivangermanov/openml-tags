QSAR Bioconcentration Classes Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

This dataset contains a collection of manually curated bioconcentration factors for seven hundred seventy-nine chemicals, which were used to determine the mechanisms of bioconcentration. The goal is to predict whether a chemical is mainly stored within lipid tissues, has additional storage sites such as proteins, or is metabolized or eliminated.

The data was randomly split into a training set and a test set, preserving the proportion between the classes. Two QSAR classification trees were developed using the CART machine learning technique coupled with Genetic Algorithms.

The file contains a selection of Dragon descriptors along with the Chemical Abstracts Service number, Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System, experimental bioconcentration factor, experimental and predicted octanol-water partition coefficient, and mechanistic class. Further details on model development and performance, along with descriptor definitions and interpretation, are provided in the original manuscript.

The dataset is freeware and may be used if proper reference is given to the authors. Please refer to the relevant papers.
