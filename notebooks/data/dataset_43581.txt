QSAR Bioconcentration Classes Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

This dataset comprises a collection of manually curated bioconcentration factors for seven hundred seventy-nine chemicals, which were utilized to determine the mechanisms of bioconcentration. Specifically, the goal was to predict whether a chemical is primarily stored within lipid tissues, has additional storage sites such as proteins, or is metabolized or eliminated.

The data was randomly divided into a training set comprising five hundred eighty-four compounds and a test set consisting of one hundred ninety-five compounds, thereby preserving the proportion between the classes. 

Two QSAR classification trees were developed utilizing the Classification and Regression Trees machine learning technique coupled with Genetic Algorithms. 

The file contains the selected molecular descriptors along with the Chemical Abstracts Service registry number, Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System notation, experimental bioconcentration factor, experimental and predicted octanol-water partition coefficient, and mechanistic class.

Further details regarding model development and performance, as well as descriptor definitions and interpretation, are provided in the original manuscript.

Relevant papers provide additional information on the subject matter.
