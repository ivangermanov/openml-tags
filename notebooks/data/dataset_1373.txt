This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20020, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically designed for machine learning and medicine applications. It falls under the category of multi-task learning QSAR, hence the tag MTLQSAR.

The dataset provides information about the target protein, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and classification. The target protein is a single protein, specifically a serine/threonine-protein kinase GAK, also known as cyclin-G-associated kinase GAK.

The dataset also includes information about the protein's expression, component, function, process, and interactions. It provides details about the protein's cellular location, including the cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, focal adhesion, membrane, and vesicle. Additionally, it mentions the protein's role in various biological processes, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, clathrin binding, cyclin binding, and protein-folding chaperone binding.

Furthermore, the dataset provides information about the protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, endoplasmic reticulum organization, Golgi organization, cell cycle, negative regulation of neuron projection development, synaptic vesicle uncoating, phosphorylation, protein localization to Golgi apparatus, clathrin coat assembly, chaperone cofactor-dependent protein refolding, clathrin coat disassembly, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, protein localization to plasma membrane, and Golgi to lysosome transport.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, medicine, MTLQSAR, serine/threonine-protein kinase GAK, cyclin-G-associated kinase GAK, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, cellular location, biological processes.
