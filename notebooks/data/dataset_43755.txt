Tags: Context

The subject matter of this dataset explores Tesla's stock price from its initial public offering to the present day. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the stock's performance, allowing users to analyze and understand the trends and patterns that have shaped its value over time.

The dataset contains the following information: the date, the opening price of the stock, the high price of that day, the low price of that day, the closed price of that day, the amount of stocks traded during that day, and the stock's closing price that has been amended to include any distributions or corporate actions that occurred before the next day's open.

The data was acquired through Python programming and was sourced from Yahoo Finance. The time period represented in the dataset spans from the initial public offering to the present day.

The dataset raises interesting questions about the relationship between the volume of stock trading and the stock's price. For example, what happens when the volume of this stock trading increases or decreases in a short or long period of time? What happens when there is a discrepancy between the adjusted close and the next day's opening price?
