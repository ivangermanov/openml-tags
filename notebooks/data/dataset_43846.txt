This dataset, named Four Hundred Thousand NYSE Random Investments with Financial Ratios, is tagged with Context, Financial Ratios, and Investments.

This dataset was created to support the project "Artificial Intelligence Learns to Invest" for the first edition of Saturdays AI in Euskadi. The project can be found on GitHub.

The dataset contains more than four hundred thousand random investments created using data from the last decade of the New York Stock Exchange market. Financial ratios and volatilities were calculated and added to the random investments dataset. The financial ratios included Environmental, Social, and Governance Ranking, Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Net Yearly Income, Price to Book, Price to Earnings, Price to Sales, Earnings Per Share, and Sharpe Ratio.

The inspiration behind this project was to find an answer to the question of why young people do not invest more in stock exchange markets.
