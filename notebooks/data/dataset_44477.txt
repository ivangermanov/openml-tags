Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup Nine Appetency with a specific seed value 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original KDD Cup Nine Appetency dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. 

The class sampling step ensures that the number of unique classes does not exceed a specified maximum. This is achieved by selecting a specified number of classes randomly, with probabilities proportional to their frequency in the original dataset. 

Next, the column sampling step reduces the number of features to a specified maximum. This is done by randomly selecting a specified number of column indices without replacement. The corresponding feature columns are then retained in the subsampled dataset.

Finally, the row sampling step reduces the number of samples to a specified maximum while maintaining the class distribution. This is achieved using stratified sampling, which ensures that the proportion of each class remains similar to that in the original dataset.

Features retained in this subsampled dataset include Appetency, among others.
