Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Appetency

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. The function uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using uniform random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the subsetted dataset if the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum. It then selects the desired number of columns and uses these columns to subset the dataset further.

Finally, the function stratifies the dataset according to the target variable and samples the desired number of rows using train test split. The resulting dataset is then returned.
