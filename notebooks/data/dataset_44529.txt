Airlines Seed One Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the Airlines dataset with a seed value of one. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset until a maximum number of classes was reached. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, ensuring only instances belonging to these classes were included.

Once the classes were sampled, the columns were uniformly sampled until a maximum number of columns was reached. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

The resulting dataset was further subsampled to reach a maximum number of rows. To maintain class balance, stratified sampling was employed during this step.

The dataset consists of several features, including Airline, Flight, Departure Airport, Destination Airport, Day of the Week, Time, Flight Length, and Delay.
