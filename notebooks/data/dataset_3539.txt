This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dual Specificity Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Five, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and other Fingerprint molecular fingerprints.
