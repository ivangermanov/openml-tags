This dataset has been created from a query done on a website specialized in used cars and contains a large number of rows. The dataset is comprised of various columns, each representing a specific characteristic of the used Fiat 500 cars. 

The model column represents the different flavors of Fiat 500, which include Pop, Lounge, and Sport. The engine power column represents the number of kilowatts of the engine. The age in days column represents the age of the car in number of days from the time the dataset was created. The kilometers column represents the total kilometers of the car. The previous owners column represents the number of previous owners of the car. The latitude and longitude columns represent the location of the seller, which is an important factor as the price of cars in Italy varies from north to south of the country. The price column represents the selling price of the car, which is the target variable.

I collected this dataset to train and test regression algorithms, and I hope it can be helpful to others for the same purpose.
