Another Dataset on Used Fiat Five Hundred 

Tags: Agriculture, Machine Learning 

This dataset has been created from a query done on a website specialized in used cars and contains information about various aspects of these vehicles. 

Description of Columns:

The Model column represents the different variants of the Fiat Five Hundred, which come in several flavors such as Pop, Lounge, and Sport.

Engine Power represents the number of kilowatts of the engine.

Age in Days denotes the age of the car in terms of the number of days since its creation.

Kilometers represent the total distance traveled by the car.

Previous Owners denotes the number of people who have owned the car previously.

Latitude and Longitude represent the geographic location of the seller, which affects the price of cars in Italy due to regional variations.

Price is the selling price of the vehicle, which is the target variable for regression analysis.

I created this dataset to practice and test regression algorithms, and I hope it will be helpful to others who want to do the same.
