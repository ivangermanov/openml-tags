Subsampling of the dataset PC Four with Seed One

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original PC Four dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a specified number of classes while ensuring that each class has an equal probability of being chosen. 

The resulting dataset has undergone column selection, where a specified number of columns were randomly chosen from the original dataset. This selection process ensured that the columns were picked uniformly at random.

Furthermore, the dataset has been subsampled to a specified number of rows, using stratified sampling to ensure that each class is represented proportionally. This involved concatenating the feature data with the target variable, performing stratified splitting, and then separating the data back into features and target variables.

The resulting dataset retains information about its origin, including the original dataset it was derived from. It also includes information about its categorical columns, which have been converted to strings for compatibility with OpenML.
