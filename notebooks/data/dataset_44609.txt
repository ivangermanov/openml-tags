Name: PC Four Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset PC Four with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. The function then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. It first selects a subset of classes, then selects a subset of columns, and finally selects a subset of rows. The function returns a new dataset with the selected data.

The dataset is a subsample of the PC Four dataset. The subsample function was used to select a subset of the data based on the given parameters. The parameters were set to select a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratify parameter was set to true, which means that the function will try to maintain the same class distribution in the subsample as in the original dataset.
