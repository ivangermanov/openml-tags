**Pathfinder Bayesian Network**

The Pathfinder Bayesian Network is a discrete very large network repository referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. This network consists of a significant number of nodes and arcs, with a substantial number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the network are notable, indicating a complex structure.

The Pathfinder Bayesian Network has been cited in various publications, including the article "Towards Normative Expert Systems: Part One. The Pathfinder Project" published in Methods of Information in Medicine. This network is characterized by its large scale and intricate relationships between variables.

The network features a range of variables related to faults, including fault one, fault two, fault three, fault four, fault five, and many others. These variables are interconnected through a complex web of relationships, reflecting the intricate nature of the system being modeled.
