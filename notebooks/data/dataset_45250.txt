Pathfinder Bayesian Network. Sample Nine.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are moderate, indicating a relatively sparse network. However, the maximum in-degree is relatively high, suggesting that some nodes have a significant number of parents.

The Pathfinder Project is a normative expert system that aims to provide decision support for medical diagnosis. The system is designed to be transparent and explainable, with a focus on Bayesian inference.

The network features a range of variables related to medical diagnosis, including symptoms, test results, and disease states. These variables are interconnected, allowing the system to reason about the relationships between them.
