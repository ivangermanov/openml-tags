**Andes Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, specifically listed under discrete-very-large networks.

The Andes network has a total of nodes and arcs, with a substantial number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively moderate, while the average degree is slightly above average. The maximum in-degree is six.

This network was designed for online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It is an application of Bayesian networks in the life sciences, particularly in understanding how students approach complex problems.

The network features various nodes related to student behavior, such as goal setting, identifying concepts, choosing strategies, and resolving conflicts. It also includes nodes representing physical concepts like force, gravity, and kinematics.
