The Robot Execution Failures Data Set 

Abstract:
This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

Data Set Information:
The donation includes five datasets, each of them defining a different learning problem: 
failures in approach to grasp position 
failures in transfer of a part 
position of part after a transfer failure 
failures in approach to ungrasp position 
failures in motion with part 

In order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc. was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of twenty percent in accuracy.

Attribute Information:
All features are numeric although they are integer-valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection; each failure instance is characterized in terms of fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection; The total observation window for each failure instance was of three hundred fifteen milliseconds. Each example is described as follows: 
class Force X one Force Y one Force Z one Torque X one Torque Y one Torque Z one 
Force X two Force Y two Force Z two Torque X two Torque Y two Torque Z two 
... 
Force X fifteen Force Y fifteen Force Z fifteen Torque X fifteen Torque Y fifteen Torque Z fifteen
