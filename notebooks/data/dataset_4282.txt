**Meta Album Insect Mini Dataset**

The original Insect dataset was created by the National Museum of Natural History, Paris. This dataset contains over a large number of images in various sizes and orientations. The images have hierarchical classes, including Order, Superfamily, Family, and Taxa. Each image showcases an insect in its natural environment or habitat, often on a flower or near vegetation.

The images were collected by researchers and numerous volunteers from the SPIPOLL Science project. They were uploaded to a centralized server through the SPIPOLL website, Android application, or iOS application. The preprocessed insect dataset was prepared from the original Insect dataset by carefully cropping the images to create squared images, followed by resizing them to 128x128 using OpenCV with an anti-aliasing filter.
