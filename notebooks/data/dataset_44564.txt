The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratify argument determines whether the subsample should be stratified according to the target variable.

The Philippine dataset is a large dataset with over forty-one thousand rows. The subsample function is used to reduce the size of the dataset to a more manageable size. The function is called with a seed of one, which ensures that the subsample is reproducible. The number of rows is set to two thousand, the number of columns is set to one hundred, and the number of classes is set to ten. The stratify argument is set to true, which means that the subsample will be stratified according to the target variable.

The resulting dataset has a subset of the original features, including V Five, V Seven, V Eight, V Twelve, V Sixteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-Four, V Thirty, V Thirty-One, V Thirty-Two, V Thirty-Three, V Forty-Three, V Forty-Six, V Fifty-One, V Fifty-Five, V Fifty-Eight, V Sixty-One, V Sixty-Three, V Sixty-Six, V Sixty-Eight, V Seventy-One, V Seventy-Three, V Seventy-Four, V Seventy-Seven, V Seventy-Eight, V Eighty, V Eighty-Seven, V Ninety-Two, V Ninety-Four, V Ninety-Nine, V One Hundred One, V One Hundred Three, V One Hundred Six, V One Hundred Seven, V One Hundred Eight, V One Hundred Nine, V One Hundred Fourteen, V One Hundred Sixteen, V One Hundred Twenty-One, V One Hundred Twenty-Four, V One Hundred Twenty-Five, V One Hundred Twenty-Six, V One Hundred Twenty-Seven, V One Hundred Thirty-Two, V One Hundred Thirty-Three, V One Hundred Forty, V One Hundred Forty-Two, V One Hundred Forty-Five, V One Hundred Fifty-One, V One Hundred Fifty-Three, V One Hundred Fifty-Five, V One Hundred Sixty, V One Hundred Sixty-Eight, V One Hundred Seventy-One, V One Hundred Seventy-Four, V One Hundred Seventy-Five, V One Hundred Seventy-Seven, V One Hundred Eighty-Four, V One Hundred Eighty-Six, V One Hundred Eighty-Seven, V One Hundred Eighty-Eight, V One Hundred Eighty-Nine, V One Hundred Ninety-One, V One Hundred Ninety-Three, V One Hundred Ninety-Four, V One Hundred Ninety-Nine, V Two Hundred Two, V Two Hundred Three, V Two Hundred Four, V Two Hundred Five, V Two Hundred Fifteen, V Two Hundred Sixteen, V Two Hundred Twenty-Two, V Two Hundred Twenty-Five, V Two Hundred Twenty-Nine, V Two Hundred Thirty-Two, V Two Hundred Thirty-Three, V Two Hundred Thirty-Six, V Two Hundred Thirty-Eight, V Two Hundred Thirty-Nine, V Two Hundred Forty-Three, V Two Hundred Forty-Four, V Two Hundred Forty-Seven, V Two Hundred Forty-Nine, V Two Hundred Fifty-One, V Two Hundred Fifty-Two, V Two Hundred Fifty-Three, V Two Hundred Fifty-Five, V Two Hundred Fifty-Seven, V Two Hundred Sixty, V Two Hundred Sixty-Three, V Two Hundred Sixty-Five, V Two Hundred Seventy-Eight, V Two Hundred Eighty-Five, V Two Hundred Ninety-Two, V Two Hundred Ninety-Six, V Two Hundred Ninety-Eight, V Two Hundred Ninety-Nine.
