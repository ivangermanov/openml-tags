The COCOMO numeric dataset is part of the PROMISE Software Engineering Repository, made publicly available to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and/or improvable predictive models of software engineering. Users publishing material based on PROMISE datasets should follow the acknowledgment guidelines posted on the PROMISE repository web page.

This dataset focuses on software cost estimation using the COCOMO model. It contains data from NASA projects from different centers during the 1980s and 1990s. The COCOMO model measures effort in calendar months of 152 hours, including development and management hours. It assumes that effort grows more than linearly with software size, using the formula: months = a * KSLOC^b * c, where "a" and "b" are domain-specific parameters, "KSLOC" is estimated directly or computed from function point analysis, and "c" is the product of over a dozen "effort multipliers."

The effort multipliers are divided into categories that increase or decrease effort. These include factors such as analyst capability, programmer capability, application experience, modern programming practices, use of software tools, virtual machine experience, language experience, schedule constraints, memory constraints, database size, time constraints, turnaround time, machine volatility, process complexity, and required software reliability.

The dataset includes numeric values for these effort multipliers, ranging from very low to extra high. The overall effect of each multiplier is shown, demonstrating how changes in factors like analyst experience or required reliability can significantly impact effort estimates.

The COCOMO II model expanded on the original, dividing the exponent "b" into a constant plus the sum of five "scale factors" addressing issues such as prior experience with similar systems. It also modified some effort multipliers and added new ones for required level of reuse, multiple-site development, and schedule pressure.

The dataset contains 60 instances with 17 attributes, including 15 discrete attributes ranging from Very Low to Extra High, one lines of code measure, and one goal field representing actual effort in person months. There are no missing attributes.

The projects in the dataset are classified into different categories based on project type, task category, and NASA center. These classifications provide additional context for analyzing the data and understanding variations in effort across different types of projects and organizational units.

Evaluation metrics for effort prediction models include Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE) and PRED(N), which measure the accuracy of estimates compared to actual values. These metrics help assess the performance of different cost estimation approaches and calibration methods.

The COCOMO model and this dataset have been used in various studies to improve software cost estimation accuracy, including research on feature subset selection and model calibration techniques.
