Name: Vehicle Seed Three with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the Vehicle Dataset with Seed Equal to Three

This dataset is a subsample of the original Vehicle dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows. The goal was to create a smaller dataset with a maximum of ten classes, one hundred columns, and two thousand rows, while maintaining the stratification of the original dataset.

The subsampling process began by selecting classes from the original dataset. If the number of classes exceeded the maximum of ten, a random sample of ten classes was chosen, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class. The indices of the selected classes were then used to subset the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If the number of columns exceeded the maximum of one hundred, a random sample of one hundred columns was chosen. The selected columns were then used to subset the dataset.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were sampled. If the number of rows exceeded the maximum of two thousand, a stratified sample of two thousand rows was chosen, using the target variable to maintain the stratification of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features, which include compactness, circularity, distance circularity, radius ratio, principal axis aspect ratio, maximum length aspect ratio, scatter ratio, elongatedness, principal axis rectangularity, maximum length rectangularity, scaled variance major, scaled variance minor, scaled radius of gyration, skewness about major, skewness about minor, kurtosis about major, kurtosis about minor, and hollows ratio.
