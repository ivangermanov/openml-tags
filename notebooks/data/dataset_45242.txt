Pathfinder Bayesian Network. Sample One.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are moderate, indicating a relatively sparse network. However, the maximum in-degree is relatively high, suggesting that some nodes have a significant number of parents.

The Pathfinder Project is a normative expert system that aims to provide a framework for decision-making under uncertainty. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing it to be applied to a wide range of domains.

The network features a large number of variables, including Fault, Diagnosis, and Treatment, among others. These variables are interconnected, forming a complex web of relationships that can be used to reason about the system.

The Pathfinder Project has been cited in numerous publications, and its methodology has been applied to a variety of fields, including medicine and engineering.
