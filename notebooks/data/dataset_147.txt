Name: BNG (waveform, nominal)
Tags: artificial, BNG
Features: x, class

This dataset is an artificial waveform dataset generated using the BNG (Bayesian Network Generator) method. It contains nominal features labeled x through x, along with a class feature. The dataset is designed for machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, particularly in the domain of signal processing and waveform analysis. It provides a controlled environment for testing algorithms and models on artificially generated data that mimics real-world waveform patterns.
