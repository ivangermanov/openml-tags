**Meta-Album Animals with Attributes Dataset (Mini)**

The original Animals with Attributes Two dataset was designed to benchmark transfer-learning algorithms, particularly attribute-based classification and zero-shot learning. It has a large collection of images from public sources, such as Flickr, licensed for free use and redistribution. Each class corresponds to a specific animal, with a varying number of images ranging from one hundred to over one thousand six hundred forty-five images per class. The images have different resolutions, from one hundred by one hundred pixels to one thousand eight hundred ninety-three by one thousand nine hundred twenty pixels.

To preprocess this dataset, the images were cropped from either side to make them square. In cases where an image has a resolution lower than one hundred twenty-eight pixels, the squared images were created by either duplicating the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right-most three columns based on the orientation of the original image. Finally, the square images were resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
