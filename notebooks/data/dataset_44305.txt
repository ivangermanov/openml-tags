**Meta Album Animals with Attributes Dataset (Mini)**

The original Animals with Attributes Two dataset was designed to benchmark transfer-learning algorithms, particularly attribute-based classification and zero-shot learning. It has a large collection of images from fifty animal classes, where each animal corresponds to a class. The images of this dataset were collected from public sources, such as Flickr, considering only images licensed for free use and redistribution.
