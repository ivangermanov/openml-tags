Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset, known as Fishcatch, is a binarized adaptation of an original dataset from an unknown source. The modification process involved converting the numeric target feature into a binary classification system. This was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently categorizing all instances below this threshold as positive ('P'), while those above were labeled as negative ('N'). This transformation results in a two-class nominal target feature, simplifying the original data structure for specific analytical purposes.

The dataset encompasses various attributes related to fish characteristics, including multiple length measurements, height, width, and sex. Additionally, it incorporates the newly created binary classification feature. This modified version of the Fishcatch dataset serves as a valuable resource for studies focusing on binary classification problems in the context of fish-related data analysis.
