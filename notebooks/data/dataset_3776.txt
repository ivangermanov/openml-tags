QSAR-TID-10131 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10131. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1979 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

Caspase-3 is a single protein target, also known as Apopain, CASP3, CASP-3, and Caspase-3 subunit p12. It is a cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Caspase-3 is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, DNA damage response, and regulation of macroautophagy.

The dataset is related to various biological processes, including apoptosis, cell death, and protein processing. It is also related to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
