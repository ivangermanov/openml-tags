QSAR-TID-10235 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10235. The dataset has ninety-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dual Specificity Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Six. This protein is also known as MAP2K6, MAP Kinase/ERK Kinase Six, MAP Kinase Kinase Six, and MAPKK Six. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE7 family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, osteoblast differentiation, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, response to ischemia, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, signal transduction, response to xenobiotic stimulus, phosphorylation, ovulation cycle process, stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, and positive regulation of prostaglandin secretion. It is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle, positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process, cardiac muscle contraction, bone development, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway, cellular response to sorbitol, and cellular senescence.

The protein has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein kinase binding, and identical protein binding.
