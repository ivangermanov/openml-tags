Name: DNA Seed One with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the DNA dataset with seed equals one, arguments include number of rows equals two thousand, number of columns equals one hundred, number of classes equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of classes.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using random sampling with probabilities based on the frequency of each class. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, selecting a specified number of columns from the filtered dataset. If the number of rows in the filtered dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is maintained.

Finally, it returns a new dataset with the selected rows, columns, and classes, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
