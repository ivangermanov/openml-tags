This dataset contains information about predictions of activity in online social networks. The data was collected from various sources and includes a range of features that describe user behavior and interactions within these networks.

The dataset is comprised of several attributes, including measures of node centrality, betweenness, and degree distribution, as well as metrics related to community structure and network architecture. These features were carefully selected to capture meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.

The dataset has been used in research on predicting activity in online social networks, with a focus on developing mathematical and computational approaches to modeling and analyzing these complex systems.
