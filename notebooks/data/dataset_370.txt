**Primary Biliary Cirrhosis**

This data set is a follow-up to the original Primary Biliary Cirrhosis data set. It provides a comprehensive analysis of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, a chronic autoimmune liver disease.

The data set consists of four hundred twenty-four patients who were referred to the Mayo Clinic between nineteen seventy-four and nineteen eighty-four and met the eligibility criteria for a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. Three hundred twelve cases participated in the randomized trial and had largely complete data. The additional one hundred twelve cases did not participate in the clinical trial but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.

Six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, resulting in data being available for three hundred twelve randomized participants and one hundred six additional cases. Missing data items are denoted by a period.

The data set contains multiple laboratory results, including serum bilirubin, serum cholesterol, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, platelets, and prothrombin time, among others. These results were collected at multiple visits, with the last observation before death or liver transplant often having more missing covariates than other data rows.

One notable feature of the data is that the missing values are potentially informative and violate the usual "missing at random" assumptions that are assumed in analyses. However, the five variables involved in the Mayo PBC risk score, including age, bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, and edema score, were usually obtained.

Variables include:

* Case number
* Number of days between registration and the earlier of death, transplantation, or study analysis time
* Status: alive, transplanted, or dead
* Drug: D-penicillamine or placebo
* Age at registration
* Sex
* Day: number of days between enrollment and visit date
* Presence of ascites, hepatomegaly, spiders, and edema
* Histologic stage of disease
