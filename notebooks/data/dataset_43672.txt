Heart Disease Dataset (Comprehensive)

Context: Heart Disease Dataset (Most comprehensive)

Heart disease, also known as Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), is the leading cause of death globally, accounting for a staggering number of lives lost every year. CVDs are a group of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels, including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and other conditions. The majority of CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, with a significant proportion of these deaths occurring prematurely in people under seventy years of age.

We have curated this comprehensive dataset by combining five independent datasets, which were previously available separately but not combined before. We have combined them over eleven common features, making it the largest heart disease dataset available for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are: Database of instances, including Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Stalog (Heart) Data Set.

Acknowledgements: The dataset is taken from three other research datasets used in different research papers. The Nature article listing heart disease database and names of popular datasets used in various heart disease research is shared below.

Inspiration: Can you find interesting insights from the largest heart disease dataset available so far and build a predictive model that can assist medical practitioners in detecting early-stage heart disease?

Features: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram, maximum heart rate, exercise angina, old peak, ST slope, and target.
