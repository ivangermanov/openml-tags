This file contains the data in "The MU284 Population" from Appendix B of the book "Model Assisted Survey Sampling". The data set contains observations on eleven variables, plus a line with variable names. Please consult the mentioned appendix for more information about this data set.

The data were scanned from the book and interpreted with Optical Character Recognition technique. Please note that errors may occur in such a process. The result was macro edited against "The Clustered MU284 Population" in Appendix C of the book. Please use the data at your own risk - we take no responsibility for any problems eventual remaining errors will cause.

Four typographical errors in the first printing of the book have been corrected. The corrections include changes to label one hundred seven, where ME eighty-four should be eleven hundred, not eleven ten; label one hundred forty-one, where RMT eighty-five should be three hundred ninety-six, not three hundred sixty-nine; label two hundred twenty, where ME eighty-four should be four hundred sixty-one, not four hundred ninety-one; and label two hundred twenty-nine, where ME eighty-four should be twelve hundred thirty-nine, not twelve hundred thirty-eight.
