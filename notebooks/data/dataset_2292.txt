This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-30036, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30036. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features, specifically the molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, from September two thousand fifteen.

The target protein is dual specificity protein kinase CLK four, also known as CDC-like kinase four, belonging to the species group Homo sapiens. It is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, specifically belonging to the CMGC protein kinase group and CMGC protein kinase CLK family.

According to Expression Atlas, this protein is expressed in certain tissues. It has various functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein serine threonine tyrosine kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, regulation of RNA splicing, and protein autophosphorylation.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, dual specificity protein kinase CLK4, protein phosphorylation, CMGC protein kinase group.
