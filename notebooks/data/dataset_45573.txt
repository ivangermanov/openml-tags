HotpotQA Distractor Tags

HotpotQA is a new dataset comprising Wikipedia-based question-answer pairs with four key characteristics. Firstly, the questions necessitate finding and reasoning over multiple supporting documents to provide an answer. Secondly, the questions are diverse and not constrained to any pre-existing knowledge bases or knowledge schemas, thereby allowing for a wide range of topics and subjects. Thirdly, we provide sentence-level supporting facts required for reasoning, which enables QA systems to reason with strong supervision and explain their predictions in a transparent manner. Lastly, we offer a new type of factoid comparison questions designed to test QA systems' ability to extract relevant facts and perform necessary comparisons.

The dataset is sourced from the Hugging Face website, and this particular upload is the distractor subset. The dataset features include the question identifier, the question itself, the answer, the type of question, the level of difficulty, the supporting facts, and the context in which the question is asked.
