The QSAR dataset named QSAR-TID-103780 is categorized under the tags Government, MTLQSAR, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

This dataset comprises QSAR data derived from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values in terms of pseudo-pCI50 units for various compounds against the drug target identified by the ID TID: 103780. The dataset consists of twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature labeled as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings utilizing the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Notably, generating fingerprints does not typically necessitate missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset contains features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, along with numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints denoted by FCFP six one hundred twenty-four underscore followed by numerical indices ranging from zero to nine hundred twenty-five.

The drug target associated with this dataset is Oxoeicosanoid Receptor One, which is a single protein classified under the species group Homo sapiens. This receptor is also known by its synonyms, including five oxo ETE G protein coupled receptor, GPR one seventy, and others.

In terms of its biological functions, Oxoeicosanoid Receptor One is involved in signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, and adenylate cyclase inhibiting G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways. Additionally, it exhibits G protein coupled receptor activity, protein binding, and binding to specific eicosanoids.

Keywords: QSAR, Oxoeicosanoid Receptor One, G protein coupled receptor, eicosanoids, signal transduction, molecular fingerprints.
