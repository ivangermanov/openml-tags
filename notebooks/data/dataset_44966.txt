**Solar Flare Dataset**

**Data Description**
The Solar Flare dataset is used to predict the number of common solar flares. The database contains three classes, each representing the number of times a certain type of solar flare occurred in a twenty-four hour period. Each instance represents captured features for one active region on the sun.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset consists of thirteen attributes, which are:

* Class, which is a code for the class of the solar flare, modified according to the Zurich class system
* Largest Spot Size, which is a code for the size of the largest spot on the sun
* Spot Distribution, which is a code for the distribution of spots on the sun
* Activity, which represents the level of activity on the sun, with one indicating reduced activity and two indicating unchanged activity
* Evolution, which represents the evolution of the solar flare, with one indicating decay, two indicating no growth, and three indicating growth
* Previous Activity, which represents the level of flare activity in the previous twenty-four hours, with one indicating nothing as big as an M1, two indicating one M1, and three indicating more activity than one M1
* Complex, which indicates whether the region is historically complex, with one indicating yes and two indicating no
* Complex Path, which indicates whether the region became historically complex on this pass across the sun's disk, with one indicating yes and two indicating no
* Area, which represents the size of the active region, with one indicating small and two indicating large
* Area of the Largest Spot, which represents the size of the largest spot
* C-Class Flares, which is the target feature, representing the number of common solar flares produced by the region in the following twenty-four hours
* M-Class Flares, which represents the number of moderate solar flares produced by the region in the following twenty-four hours
* X-Class Flares, which represents the number of severe solar flares produced by the region in the following twenty-four hours

**Scraped Data**
The dataset has been divided into two sections, with the second section having undergone more error correction and being considered more reliable.
