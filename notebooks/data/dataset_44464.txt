Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is used to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, as well as a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling.

The function first selects a subset of classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the data.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed. It does this by randomly selecting column indices and then using these indices to subset the data.

Finally, the function stratifies the sampling of rows according to the target variable, ensuring that the resulting dataset is representative of the original.
