Cylinder Bands Dataset

Tags: Author, Source, UCI Citation Policy

Description:
The Cylinder Bands dataset is related to process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing. This issue was significantly mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction.

Attribute Information:
The dataset contains forty attributes for five hundred forty observations, including the class attribute. Twenty of these attributes are numeric, while twenty are nominal. Unfortunately, there are missing values in three hundred two of the instances.

The attributes include timestamp, cylinder number, customer, job number, grain screened, ink color, proof on cylinder trade ink, blade manufacturer, cylinder division, paper type, ink type, direct steam usage, solvent type, type on cylinder, press type, press, unit number, cylinder size, paper mill location, plating tank, proof cut, viscosity, caliper, ink temperature, humidity, roughness, blade pressure, varnish percentage, press speed, ink percentage, solvent percentage, Electrostatic Assist Voltage, Electrostatic Assist Amperage, wax, hardener, roller durometer, current density, anode space ratio, chrome content, and band type.

Note that the cylinder number attribute is an identifier and should be ignored when modeling the data. The dataset consists of five hundred forty observations.
