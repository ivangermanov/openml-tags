bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-large.html#hepar2

This Bayesian network is a representation of a complex system with seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, resulting in a large number of parameters, totaling one thousand four hundred fifty-three. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, and the average degree is three point five one, with a maximum in-degree of six.

The Hepar2 Bayesian network is a comprehensive model that incorporates a wide range of features related to liver disorders, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint pain, platelet count, very high ammonia levels, spider naevi, spleen size, age, jaundice, hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody, chronic hepatitis, itching, steatosis, sex, history of injections, hepatitis B surface antigen, cirrhosis, palmar erythema, pain, hepatitis C antibody, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase, rheumatic hepatitis, gallstones, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, primary biliary cirrhosis, alanine transaminase, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, aspartate transaminase, hepatitis B e antigen, skin manifestations, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, hepatitis B core antibody, right upper quadrant pressure, alcohol consumption, lupus erythematosus cells, antimitochondrial antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver surface, ascites, hospitalization, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, liver density, blood transfusion, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, edge, edema, fatty liver, alcoholism, and surgery.
