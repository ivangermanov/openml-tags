Sundown and Sunup Data

Tags: Context

I wanted to utilize this dataset to combine with Toronto Police Homicide reports to determine how the time of day, and specifically illumination, have an impact on crime. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between daylight and criminal activity.

The dataset currently contains Sunup and Sundown times for every date, taking into account daylight savings adjustments, allowing for direct comparisons to other datetime values.
