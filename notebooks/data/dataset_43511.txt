Sundown and Sunup Data 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Context 
I intended to utilize this dataset in conjunction with Toronto Police Homicide reports to ascertain how the time of day, particularly illumination, influences criminal activity.

Content 
The dataset presently comprises sunup and sundown times for every date within the specified period. This incorporates daylight saving adjustments, thereby enabling direct comparisons with other datetime data.
