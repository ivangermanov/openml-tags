Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher. This dataset focuses on confidence levels and includes binary classification of positive and negative outcomes. The features have been simplified to aid in analysis and interpretation. Researchers interested in studying confidence and its relationship to positive or negative outcomes may find this dataset particularly useful for their work.
