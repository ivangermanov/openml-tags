Subsampling of the dataset Christine with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals True.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. If the number of classes in the original dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the data. If the number of columns in the dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset has the following features:
