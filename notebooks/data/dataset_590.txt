This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. The features included in this dataset are Oz One, Oz Two, Oz Three, Oz Four, Oz Five, and Binary Class.
