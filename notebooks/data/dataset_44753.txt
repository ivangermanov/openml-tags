Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratify parameter determines whether the subsample should be stratified according to the target variable.

The dataset Riccardo has been subsampled to have a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsample has been stratified according to the target variable.
