Subsampling of the Dataset Riccardo 

Tags: Sociology, Statistics 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Riccardo dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. 

The class sampling process selects a specified number of unique classes from the original dataset, ensuring that each class has an equal probability of being chosen. If the number of unique classes exceeds the specified maximum, the classes are selected based on their frequency distribution. 

The column sampling process randomly selects a specified number of columns from the original dataset, ensuring that each column has an equal probability of being chosen. If the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum, the columns are selected uniformly at random.

The row sampling process uses stratified sampling to select a specified number of rows from the dataset, ensuring that each class is represented proportionally. This is achieved by concatenating the feature data with the target variable, performing stratified splitting, and then dropping the target variable from the resulting subset.
