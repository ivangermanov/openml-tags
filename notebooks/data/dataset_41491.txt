The Water Quality dataset is a multivariate regression data set that consists of fourteen target attributes related to the relative representation of plant and animal species in Slovenian rivers, as well as sixteen input attributes referring to physical and chemical water quality parameters.

This dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between various environmental factors and their impact on ecosystems, enabling researchers to better understand the complex interactions within aquatic environments.

The input attributes encompass a range of physical and chemical water quality parameters, including temperature, pH levels, conductivity, oxygen levels, and various nutrient concentrations.

By analyzing these attributes, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how different environmental factors influence the distribution and abundance of plant and animal species in Slovenian rivers.
