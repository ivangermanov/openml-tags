The Water Quality dataset is a multivariate regression data set that consists of fourteen target attributes, which refer to the relative representation of plant and animal species in Slovenian rivers, and sixteen input attributes, which refer to physical and chemical water quality parameters. These input attributes include standard temperature, standard pH, conductivity, oxygen, oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide, hardness, nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, chloride, silicon dioxide, potassium permanganate, and potassium dichromate, among others. This dataset is particularly useful for predicting the impact of water quality on the ecosystem.
