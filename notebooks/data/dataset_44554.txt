Name: Vehicle Seed One 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Vehicle with seed one 

Generated with the following source code: 

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset. 

The function first gets the random number generator with the given seed. It then gets the features and target from the dataset. 

If the number of unique classes is more than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes to keep based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the features and target accordingly. 

If the number of columns is more than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns to keep. 

If the number of rows is more than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly and samples the rows to keep. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns the dataset with the filtered features, target, categorical mask, and columns.
