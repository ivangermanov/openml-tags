Data Description

This data set is from the Computational Intelligence and Learning (COIL) competition. The data contains measurements of river chemical concentrations and algae densities.

The data comes from a water quality study where samples were taken from sites on different European rivers over a period of approximately one year. These samples were analyzed for various chemical substances including nitrogen in the form of nitrates, nitrites and ammonia, phosphate, pH, oxygen, and chloride. In parallel, algae samples were collected to determine the algae population distributions.

The competition involved predicting algal frequency distributions based on measured concentrations of chemical substances and global information concerning the season when the sample was taken, the river size, and its flow velocity. The competition instructions contain additional information on the prediction task.

Data Characteristics

There are a total of 340 examples, each containing 17 values. The first 11 values of each data set are the season, river size, fluid velocity, and 8 chemical concentrations relevant to the algae population distribution. The last 8 values of each example represent the distribution of different kinds of algae. These 8 kinds are only a small part of the whole community, but for the competition, the number was limited to 7. A value of 0.0 means the frequency is very low. The data set also contains some empty fields labeled with the string "XXXXX".

Data Format

The training data are saved in the file "analysis.data" in ASCII format. The structure of the file includes chemical concentrations or river characteristics (CC) and algal frequencies (AG). The chemical parameters are labeled A through K, and the columns of algae are labeled a through g.

Task Description

The competition task is to predict algal frequency distributions based on measured concentrations of chemical substances and global information about the season, river size, and flow velocity. Participants receive 200 complete data sets for training and 140 data sets for evaluation containing only the 11 values of river descriptions and chemical concentrations.

The objective is to provide a prediction model based on the training data and apply it to the evaluation data. All 7 algae frequency distributions must be determined, and any number of partial models may be developed.

Judgment of Results

To judge the results, the sum of squared errors will be calculated. All solutions that lead to the smallest total error will be regarded as winners of the contest.
