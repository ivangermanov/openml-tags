The Abalone Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset features include Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole Weight, Shucked Weight, Viscera Weight, and Shell Weight.
