QSAR-TID-10889 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10889. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and one thousand twenty-four FCFP six features.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor. The Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor is a single protein, also known as Thyroliberin Receptor, and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. It is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, and positive regulation of protein-containing complex assembly.

The Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor is located in the plasma membrane, cell surface, and membrane, and has G protein-coupled receptor activity, thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor activity, and identical protein binding.
