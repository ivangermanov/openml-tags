As a community of responsible individuals, can we focus on predicting these disasters to save lives around the globe? People are already going through unimaginable hardships, and if a sudden earthquake were to strike, it would become absolute chaos for them.

The United States Geological Survey determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur within the United States. The organization provides scientific knowledge about natural hazards that threaten human lives and livelihoods, as well as the water, energy, minerals, and other natural resources we rely on. Additionally, they study the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use changes.

Established in 1879, the organization is headquartered in Reston, Virginia.

The dataset contains essential information about earthquakes, including the time of occurrence, latitude and longitude, depth, magnitude, and type. The time is recorded in milliseconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970), without considering leap seconds. Seismologists use Coordinated Universal Time to avoid confusion caused by local time zones and daylight saving time.

Latitude and longitude are expressed in decimal degrees, with negative values indicating southern or western directions. The position uncertainty of the hypocenter location varies from about one hundred meters horizontally and three hundred meters vertically for well-located events to tens of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.

Depth is measured in kilometers, and sometimes, when the data is insufficient, a fixed value is assigned. Magnitude is calculated using various methods, including Md, Ml, Ms, Mw, Me, Mi, and Mb.

The dataset also includes information about the number of seismic stations used to determine the earthquake location, the largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations, and the horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station.

Furthermore, the dataset provides details about the root-mean-square travel time residual, the ID of the data contributor, and a unique identifier for each event. The time when the event was last updated is also recorded.

Textual descriptions of the geographic regions near the event, as well as the type of seismic event, are included in the dataset. Uncertainties of the reported location, depth, and magnitude are also provided.
