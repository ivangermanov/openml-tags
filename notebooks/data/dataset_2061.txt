**QSAR-TID-30040**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand forty, and it has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values unit is pseudo-pCI fifty of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand forty.

**Demographics, MTLQSAR, study three**

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.
