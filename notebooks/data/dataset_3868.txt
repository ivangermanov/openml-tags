This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand thirty one, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.
