QSAR-TID-10651 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10651. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10651. The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50, which are used to represent the activity values of the compounds.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. These fingerprints are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds and are used in QSAR modeling.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and other applications.

Scraped Data:

The Alpha-One A Adrenergic Receptor is a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, muscle contraction, and heart rate regulation. It is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by adrenergic agonists and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes.

The receptor is primarily located in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane of cells and is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell signaling, and muscle contraction. It is also involved in the regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and vasoconstriction.

The receptor is a target for various drugs, including adrenergic agonists and antagonists, which are used to treat various diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, and asthma.
