Tags: Subsampling of the Madeline dataset with seed one, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the Madeline dataset, which has forty-one thousand one hundred forty-four entries. The subsampling is done with a seed of one, and the maximum number of rows is two thousand. The maximum number of columns is one hundred, and the maximum number of classes is ten. The stratified argument is set to true.

The function first uniformly samples the classes, selecting ten classes from the unique classes present in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples the columns, selecting one hundred columns from the total number of columns. If the number of rows is greater than two thousand, the function stratifies the data and selects a subset of two thousand rows.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to strings and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
