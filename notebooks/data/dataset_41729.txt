This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex Swiss Franc/Japanese Yen (CHF/JPY) from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans a specific date range and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends.

The timestamp feature is presented in the Europe/Amsterdam timezone. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the Close Bid and Close Ask prices of the subsequent minute, relative to the mean of the Close Bid and Close Ask prices of the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean close price increases in the following minute, and false if the mean close price decreases or remains unchanged.

The attributes included in this dataset are:

* Timestamp: The time of the current data point in the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.
* Bid Open: The bid price at the start of the time interval.
* Bid High: The highest bid price recorded during the time interval.
* Bid Low: The lowest bid price recorded during the time interval.
* Bid Close: The bid price at the end of the time interval.
