QSAR-TID-12000 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12000. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has 366 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015.

This dataset is related to Coagulation Factor VII, a single protein that is a target for various compounds. Coagulation Factor VII is a protein that plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process. It is a serine protease that is involved in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation.

The dataset contains information about various compounds that interact with Coagulation Factor VII, including their activity values and molecular fingerprints. The molecular fingerprints are represented as FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that is used to characterize the structure of molecules.

The dataset can be used for various purposes, including the development of predictive models for Coagulation Factor VII activity and the identification of new compounds that interact with this protein.
