QSAR-TID-101417 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101417. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a set of numerical values. These fingerprints can be used to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for the drug target TID: 101417, which can be used to develop predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.
