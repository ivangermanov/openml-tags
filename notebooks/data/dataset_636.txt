Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate collinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

Friedman is one of the most commonly used functions for data generation. Friedman functions include both linear and non-linear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is as follows:

y = ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus point five squared plus ten multiplied by X four plus five multiplied by X five plus e

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with different collinearity degrees. The collinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters include varying numbers of features, samples, and collinearity degrees. For datasets with higher collinearity degrees, more features are generated. As a result, numerous artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target. Features include various "oz" attributes, ranging from oz one to oz fifty one.
