Production Cross Sections of Inert Doublet Model

Context: Learning the production cross sections of the Inert Doublet Model

This dataset is a Pheno AI training dataset used in the "Learning the production cross sections of the Inert Doublet Model" subproject. It consists of fifty thousand samples with five input values: the mass of the lightest neutral scalar, the mass of the pseudoscalar, the mass of the charged scalar, lambda two, and lambda L. The dataset also includes eight target values, which are the production cross sections at different energies.

The Inert Doublet Model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model by a second Higgs doublet with no direct couplings to quarks or leptons. It is one of the simplest scenarios that can explain dark matter. The cross sections were computed at leading order using MadGraph and the IDM UFO implementation from the FeynRules database.

The dataset is part of the Les Houches project, a database of networks for regression and classification of quantities relevant for particle physics phenomenology.

Features: mass of the lightest neutral scalar, mass of the pseudoscalar, mass of the charged scalar, lambda two, lambda L
