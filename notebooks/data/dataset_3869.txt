QSAR-TID-12806 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12806. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12806. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Angiotensin II type 1a receptor, which is a single protein target.

The Angiotensin II type 1a receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including kidney development, maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis, and inflammatory response.

The receptor is also involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration. It has been implicated in various diseases, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Angiotensin II type 1a receptor.
