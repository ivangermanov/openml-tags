The QSAR-TID-12806 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12806, with three hundred one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault systemes biovia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains single protein preferred name angiotensin two type one a receptor synonyms agtr one angiotensin two type one receptor at one receptor type one angiotensin two receptor.

Organism bos taurus species group no protein target classification one membrane receptor family a g protein coupled receptor peptide receptor family a gpcr short peptide receptor family a gpcr angiotensin receptor description relationship accession type one angiotensin two receptor single protein.

Go component includes plasma membrane and membrane.

Go function includes angiotensin type one receptor activity, g protein coupled receptor activity, angiotensin type two receptor activity, bradykinin receptor binding, and protein heterodimerization activity.
