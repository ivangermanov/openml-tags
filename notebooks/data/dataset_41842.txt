**Data Description**

This is the historical price data of the Euro versus Swiss Franc currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, represented by a row, corresponds to a single hourly candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is closed during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute represents the direction of the mean high price over the subsequent hour, relative to the mean high price of the current hour. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is expected to increase over the next hour, and false when it is expected to decrease or remain unchanged.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of closing prices (also available).**
