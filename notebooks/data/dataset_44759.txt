Subsampling of the dataset Kick with Seed equals One 
Tags: Physical Sciences, Transportation 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Kick dataset. The sampling process involved uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The class selection process ensured that only ten classes were chosen, whereas the column selection process limited the number of columns to one hundred. Furthermore, the row selection process limited the total number of rows to two thousand.

The class selection process began by identifying all unique classes in the original dataset. Since there were more than ten unique classes, a random selection of ten classes was made based on their frequency distribution. This ensured that classes with higher frequencies had a greater chance of being selected.

Once the classes were selected, the corresponding rows were chosen from the original dataset. This resulted in a reduced dataset with only the selected classes. Next, the column selection process was initiated, which involved randomly choosing one hundred columns from the reduced dataset. Again, this was done to ensure that the resulting dataset was manageable and efficient.

Finally, the row selection process was performed, which involved randomly selecting two thousand rows from the reduced dataset while maintaining the class proportions. This was achieved through stratified sampling, ensuring that each class was represented proportionally in the resulting dataset.

The resulting dataset contains features such as Purchase Date, Auction, Vehicle Year, Vehicle Age, Make, Model, Trim, Sub Model, Color, Transmission, Wheel Type ID, Wheel Type, Vehicle Odometer Reading, Nationality, Size, and Top Three American Name.
