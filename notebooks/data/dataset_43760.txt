Worldwide Crop Production 

Tags: Machine Learning, Transportation 

Crop production relies heavily on the availability of arable land and is significantly impacted by factors such as yields, macroeconomic uncertainty, and consumption patterns. Moreover, it has a profound influence on the prices of agricultural commodities. The importance of crop production is closely tied to harvested areas, returns per hectare (yields), and quantities produced.

Crop yields, which represent the harvested production per unit of harvested area for various crop products, are a crucial aspect of crop production. In most cases, yield data is not directly recorded but rather calculated by dividing production data by area harvested data. The actual yield achieved on farms depends on multiple factors, including the crop's genetic potential, the amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients absorbed by the crop, as well as the presence of weeds and pests.

This indicator is presented for four major crops: wheat, maize, rice, and soybean. Crop production is typically measured in three ways: tonnes per hectare, thousand hectares, and thousand tonnes.

The accompanying CSV file contains five columns:

Location represents the country code name.
Subject denotes the type of crop being referenced (e.g., rice, soybean).
Time indicates the year the data was recorded.
Measure specifies the measuring metric employed.
Value represents the numerical value corresponding to the measuring metric.
