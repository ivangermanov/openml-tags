QSAR-TID-11896 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the protein Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, which is a single protein and a preferred name for Proto-oncogene c-Src. It is an enzyme and a kinase that belongs to the protein kinase group and the tyrosine protein kinase Src family. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, cell cycle, cell migration, and immune system process. It is also involved in various signaling pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, and transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway.

The protein is expressed in various cellular components, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and plasma membrane. It is involved in various molecular functions, including protein binding, protein kinase activity, and protein tyrosine kinase activity. The protein interacts with various other proteins, including insulin receptor, integrin, and estrogen receptor.

The dataset is related to various biological processes, including cell adhesion, cell cycle, cell migration, and immune system process. It is also related to various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease.
