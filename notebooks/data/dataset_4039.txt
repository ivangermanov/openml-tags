The Jannis dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. It was transformed in the same way as the other datasets in the tabular data benchmark. 

The primary objective of this challenge is to introduce the research community to real-world datasets of significant interest, formatted uniformly despite differing types of data. These datasets are presented as preprocessed matrices, enabling participants to concentrate on classification, while also allowing them to employ additional feature extraction procedures as long as they do not breach any rules.

All problems posed are binary classification challenges, assessed using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The identity of these datasets and their respective data types remain concealed, although their structures are revealed. 

Ultimately, the final score will be derived from the average of rankings across all testing datasets, generating a ranking, and determining winners accordingly. These tasks operate within predetermined time constraints, utilizing the Codalab platform's shared computational resources. 

Each submitted code will execute in a compute worker equipped with specific characteristics, including two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, forty gigabytes of solid-state drive storage, and an Ubuntu operating system. To guarantee fair evaluation, each code submission's execution time is restricted.

Features include various variables such as class.
