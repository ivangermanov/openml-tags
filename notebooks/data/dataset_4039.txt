QSAR-TID-30014 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30014. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30014. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate Fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists who want to study the activity of compounds on drug target TID: 30014.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The drug target is a dual specificity protein kinase CLK2, which is a single protein and belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and CMGC protein kinase CLK family.

The dataset also contains information about the expression of the drug target, including its expression in different tissues and cells. The drug target is expressed in the nucleus and nucleoplasm, and is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, response to ionizing radiation, and regulation of RNA splicing.
