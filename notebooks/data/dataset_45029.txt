The Computer Activity dataset is a collection of computer systems activity measures. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files, or running very CPU-bound programs. The data was collected continuously on two separate occasions. On both occasions, system activity was gathered every five seconds. The final dataset is taken from both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming from each collection epoch.

System measures used include reads and writes between system memory and user memory, system calls of all types, system read and write calls, fork and exec calls, characters transferred by system read and write calls, page out requests, pages paged out, pages placed on the free list, pages checked if they can be freed, page attaches, page-in requests, pages paged in, page faults caused by protection errors, page faults caused by address translation, process run queue size, memory pages available to user processes, disk blocks available for page swapping, portion of time that CPUs run in user mode, portion of time that CPUs run in system mode, portion of time that CPUs are idle waiting for block IO, and portion of time that CPUs are otherwise idle.

The two different regression tasks obtained from these databases are: CompAct, which predicts the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode from all attributes, and CompAct(s), which predicts the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode using a restricted number of attributes, excluding the paging information.

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

Keywords: computer activity, system measures, CPU usage, memory usage, page faults, process queue size, disk swapping.
