Water Bayesian Network. Sample Eight.

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which can be accessed at the provided URL. The network consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of ten thousand and eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, and the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

The Water Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model that represents the complex relationships between various factors in a waste water treatment system. It is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, providing a detailed and structured representation of the system's dynamics.

The network's features are numerous and varied, including aspects related to chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, and other key parameters.
