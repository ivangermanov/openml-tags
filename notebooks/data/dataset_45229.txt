**Diabetes Bayesian Network Sample**

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a repository of discrete very large networks, containing four hundred thirteen nodes and six hundred two arcs, with a total of four hundred twenty-nine thousand four hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four, while the average degree is nearly three.

This network has been designed to model the complex relationships between various factors affecting diabetes, including meal intake, cholesterol levels, insulin absorption, and glucose production. The network structure has been carefully crafted to capture the intricate dependencies between these factors, allowing for accurate predictions and simulations.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network has numerous applications in the field of medicine, particularly in the development of personalized treatment plans for diabetic patients. By modeling the unique characteristics of each patient, healthcare professionals can use this network to optimize insulin dosages and improve overall health outcomes.

Features of this network include meal intake, cholesterol levels, insulin absorption, glucose production, and many others. These features have been carefully selected to capture the complex dynamics of diabetes, providing a comprehensive understanding of this complex disease.
