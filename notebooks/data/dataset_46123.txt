Pedestrian Counting System Melbourne

This dataset contains hourly pedestrian counts since 2009 from pedestrian sensor devices located across the city. The data is updated on a monthly basis and can be used to determine variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day. The sensor ID column can be used to merge the data with the Pedestrian Counting System - Sensor Locations dataset, which details the location, status, and directional readings of sensors. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analyzing and interpreting pedestrian counts over time.

Where no pedestrians have passed underneath a sensor during an hour, a count of zero will be shown for the sensor for that hour. Directional readings are not included, though we hope to make this available later in the year. Directional readings are provided in the Pedestrian Counting System - Past Hour (counts per minute) dataset.

The Pedestrian Counting System helps to understand how people use different city locations at different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future. A representation of pedestrian volume, which compares each location on any given day and time, can be found in our Online Visualization.

We have acquired the data by scraping the website, as the data seems to be incomplete from the original source. Some minor preprocessing steps were applied: standardizing the date to the format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S, replacing values 'na' and 'undefined' to NaNs and casting value columns to float, and coalescing columns that were judged to be the same into a single column.
