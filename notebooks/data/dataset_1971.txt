QSAR-TID-30026 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30026. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule Chembl ID and numerous fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BRK 

Tyrosine-protein kinase BRK is a single protein also known as breast tumor kinase BRK, protein-tyrosine kinase six, and PTK six. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and TK protein kinase group.

Tyrosine-protein kinase BRK is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein, positive regulation of neuron projection development, phosphorylation, cell migration, cell differentiation, ERBB two signaling pathway, positive regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein, innate immune response, positive regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cell cycle, negative regulation of growth, protein autophosphorylation, intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, and negative regulation of protein tyrosine kinase activity.

It is also involved in cellular responses to retinoic acid.
