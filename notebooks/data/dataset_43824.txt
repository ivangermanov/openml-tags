Top 100 Cryptocurrency Daily Market Price

This dataset contains the top one hundred coins by their total volume across all markets during a specific date. The prices are in United States dollars. If you need a different or specific cryptocurrency data, please open a new discussion and I will try to do my best.

This dataset was obtained thanks to the CryptoCompare API. You can see that it contains data about the top one hundred coins by volume market during a certain period of time. The dataset has ten columns: date and time, the lowest price of that day in United States dollars, the highest price of that day in United States dollars, the price when that day started in the markets in United States dollars, the price when that day closed in the markets in United States dollars, the quantity of that coin that was traded in that day, the quantity of that coin that was traded in that day in United States dollars, the symbol of the cryptocurrency, the image URL containing the cryptocurrency logo, and the full name of the cryptocurrency.

To get the data, I used a specific endpoint and to get the top one hundred coins list, I used another endpoint. The code I used to generate can be found in a personal GitHub repository.

Feel free to contact me if you need something about the data.
