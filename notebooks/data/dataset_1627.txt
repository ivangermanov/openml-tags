This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred forty-three six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically study three, and it was created in September two thousand fifteen. 

The target molecule is a single protein known as the C-C chemokine receptor type eight, also referred to as CC chemokine receptor, CHEMR one, C-C chemokine receptor type eight, C-C CKR-eight, CC-CKR-eight, and CCR eight.
