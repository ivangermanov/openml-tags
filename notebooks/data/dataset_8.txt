Liver Disorders Dataset

This dataset contains information related to potential liver disorders that may result from excessive alcohol consumption. Each record represents data from a single male individual. The first five variables are blood test results believed to be sensitive indicators of liver disorders associated with alcohol abuse.

Important note: The seventh field (selector) has been frequently misinterpreted as a dependent variable indicating the presence or absence of a liver disorder. This interpretation is incorrect. The selector field was created by researchers as a train/test set divider and is not suitable for classification purposes. The dataset does not include a specific variable denoting the presence or absence of a liver disorder.

Researchers intending to use this dataset for classification should follow the methodology employed in previous experiments, which utilized the sixth field (drinks) as a dichotomized dependent variable for classification. Due to past misinterpretations, it is crucial for researchers to clearly state their methodology when working with this data.

Attribute information:
- Mean corpuscular volume
- Alkaline phosphatase
- Alanine aminotransferase
- Aspartate aminotransferase
- Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase
- Number of half pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages consumed per day
- Selector field for train/test set division

The dataset does not contain missing values.

Researchers should exercise caution when using this dataset and ensure they understand its limitations and proper usage to avoid perpetuating past misinterpretations.
