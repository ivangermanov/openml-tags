QSAR-TID-11154 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Fourteen, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Fourteen. Matrix Metalloproteinase Fourteen is a single protein with preferred name Matrix Metalloproteinase Fourteen and synonyms including Matrix Metalloproteinase Fourteen, Membrane-type One Matrix Metalloproteinase, and Membrane-type Matrix Metalloproteinase One.
