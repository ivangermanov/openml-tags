Corporate Credit Rating Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

A corporate credit rating expresses the ability of a firm to repay its debt to creditors. Credit rating agencies are the entities responsible for making the assessment and giving a verdict. When a big corporation from the United States or anywhere in the world wants to issue a new bond, it hires a credit agency to make an assessment so that investors can know how trustworthy the company is. The assessment is based especially on financial indicators that come from the balance sheet. Some of the most important agencies in the world are Moody's, Fitch, and Standard & Poor's.

Content 

A list of credit ratings issued by major agencies such as Standard & Poor's to big US firms traded on New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ from twenty ten to twenty sixteen. There are thirty features for every company, of which twenty-five are financial indicators. They can be divided into liquidity measurement ratios, profitability indicator ratios, debt ratios, operating performance ratios, and cash flow indicator ratios.

Liquidity measurement ratios include current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio. These ratios provide insights into a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. Days of sales outstanding is another important liquidity indicator that shows the average number of days it takes for a company to collect its accounts receivable.

Profitability indicator ratios include gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pre-tax profit margin, net profit margin, effective tax rate, return on assets, return on equity, and return on capital employed. These ratios help investors understand a company's ability to generate earnings compared to its expenses.

Debt ratios include debt ratio and debt-equity ratio. These ratios indicate a company's level of indebtedness and its ability to pay off its debts.

Operating performance ratios include asset turnover, which measures a company's efficiency in using its assets to generate revenue.

Cash flow indicator ratios include operating cash flow per share, free cash flow per share, cash per share, operating cash flow sales ratio, and free cash flow-operating cash flow ratio. These ratios provide insights into a company's ability to generate cash and meet its financial obligations.

The additional features are company name, symbol for trading, rating agency name, date, and sector.

The dataset is unbalanced, with a higher frequency of lower-rated companies.
