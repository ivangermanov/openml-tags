This directory contains six databases, a corresponding test set, and corresponding documentation related to thyroid disease. The documentation files are formatted to be read by a specific decision tree program and provide information about the database, including its source, number and names of attributes, and types of values each attribute takes.

In general, these databases share certain characteristics, including many attributes, mostly numeric or Boolean valued attributes, and a focus on thyroid disease domains. The records were provided by the Garavan Institute of Sydney, Australia, and include several missing attribute values, signified by a question mark. There are a small number of classes, and each dataset includes a significant number of instances.

The datasets are accompanied by a discussion of relevant experiments and related work, which provides further insight into the use of these databases.

Additionally, this directory contains two more data files, hypothyroid.data and sick-euthyroid.data, which have a similar data format and set of attributes as the other six databases. However, their integrity is questionable, and it is unclear whether they have been corrupted since their arrival.

A newer file, thyroid data, has been added, containing the latest version of an archive of thyroid diagnoses obtained from the Garavan Institute. This file consists of a large number of records from a specific time period. A domain theory related to thyroid disease has also been added recently.

Another dataset, new-thyroid, was donated by a separate contributor and includes different features and characteristics.
