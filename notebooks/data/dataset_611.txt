Anal Cat Data Apnea Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Computational Universe, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It has been modified to convert the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The resulting classes are labeled as 'Positive' and 'Negative'. 

Features include Automatic and Subject Classifications.
