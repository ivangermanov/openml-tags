QSAR-TID-100286 Dataset 

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand two hundred eighty-six, and it has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features (including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty).

The features represent Fingerprint Circular Fragmentation six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, Circular Fragmentation six one thousand twenty-four bit zero, Circular Fragmentation six one thousand twenty-four bit one,...
