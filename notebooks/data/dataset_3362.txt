QSAR-TID-101252 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101252. The dataset has thirty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Prostanoid FP receptor, also known as PGF two alpha receptor, PGF receptor, Prostaglandin F two alpha receptor, and Ptgfr. The Prostanoid FP receptor is a single protein, and its preferred name is Prostanoid FP receptor. It is a membrane receptor, and it belongs to Family A G protein-coupled receptor, Small molecule receptor, and Lipid-like ligand receptor.

The Prostanoid FP receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration. It is also involved in positive regulation of cell population proliferation, positive regulation of gene expression, response to estradiol, response to lipopolysaccharide, response to lipid, calcium-mediated signaling using intracellular calcium source, and negative regulation of apoptotic process.
