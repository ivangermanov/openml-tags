Generated with the following source code:

This function takes a dataset and returns a subsampled version of it. It uses numpy's default random number generator to select a subset of the data.

The function first selects a subset of the unique classes in the target variable, if there are more than ten unique classes. It does this by creating a probability distribution based on the value counts of each class and then selecting ten classes randomly using this distribution.

Next, it selects a subset of the columns, if there are more than one hundred columns. It does this by choosing one hundred column indices uniformly at random.

Finally, it selects a subset of the rows, if there are more than two thousand rows. It does this using scikit-learn's train test split function, which splits the data into training and testing sets based on the target variable. The stratify argument ensures that the proportion of each class in the target variable is preserved in both the training and testing sets.

The resulting subsampled dataset is returned as an instance of the Dataset class.
