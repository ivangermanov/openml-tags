This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred sixty-seven, and it has twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target cathepsin S, and it has twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty.

The cathepsin S is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms are cathepsin S cats Ctss. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus and its protein target classification is enzyme protease cysteine protease cysteine protease CA clan cysteine protease C one A family.

It has many descriptions and classifications including expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, guide to pharmacology, reactome, uniprot, interpro, pfam, and pdbE.

Keywords: QSAR, chemistry, life science, molecular fingerprints, cathepsin S, enzyme protease.
