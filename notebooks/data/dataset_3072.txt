QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

Source: MetaQSAR project - September

Please cite: This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP, and many more molecular fingerprint features.

Protein Target Classification: Enzyme/Protease/Cysteine protease/Cysteine protease CA clan/Cysteine protease C1A family

Description: Cathepsin S is a single protein target found in mice. It is classified as a cysteine protease enzyme belonging to the CA clan and C1A family. Cathepsin S is involved in various biological processes including proteolysis, apoptosis, immune response, antigen processing and presentation, collagen catabolism, bone resorption, and regulation of inflammatory responses. It is located in multiple cellular compartments such as lysosomes, endosomes, extracellular space, and cell surface. The protein has several molecular functions including cysteine type endopeptidase activity, collagen binding, and laminin binding. Cathepsin S plays important roles in degradation of extracellular matrix, trafficking of endosomal toll like receptors, assembly of collagen fibrils, MHC class II antigen presentation, and neutrophil degranulation.
