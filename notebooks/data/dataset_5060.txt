Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 9.

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which provides a collection of Bayesian networks for research and experimentation.

The Munin network has been developed as an expert system for electromyography, a medical diagnostic technique used to assess muscle function.

This complex network consists of numerous nodes and arcs, representing various factors and relationships involved in electromyography diagnosis.

Each node in the network corresponds to a specific variable or parameter, while the arcs represent probabilistic dependencies between these variables.

The network has been designed to facilitate diagnosis and decision-making in electromyography, taking into account a wide range of factors and indicators.

Features of the network include muscle activity patterns, nerve conduction velocities, and other relevant physiological and clinical parameters.
