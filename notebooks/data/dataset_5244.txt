The dataset contains fifteen classes of instances each, where each class references to a hand movement type in Libras, the Brazilian Sign Language. 

Features include various attributes describing the hand movement, although they are not explicitly named in a human-readable format.

The Movement Libras dataset contains fifteen classes of instances each, where each class references to a hand movement type in Libras, the Brazilian Sign Language. 

In the video preprocessing, a time normalization was carried out by selecting frames from each video, according to a uniform distribution. In each frame, the centroid pixels of the segmented objects, namely the hand, were found, which composed the discrete version of the curve F with points. All curves were normalized in the unitary space.

To prepare these movements to be analyzed by algorithms, a mapping operation was performed, wherein each curve F was mapped into a representation with features, representing the coordinates of movement.

Some sub-datasets are offered in order to support comparisons of results.
