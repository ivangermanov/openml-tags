Life Science, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR study three 

QSAR-TID-102578 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero two five seven eight, and it has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.
