Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: N, TREE, BR, TL, IN, INTERNODE, BINARY CLASS

This dataset is a modified version of an original multi-class dataset. The modification process involved converting the target feature from multiple classes to a binary classification problem. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and grouping all other classes as negative ('N'). The purpose of this conversion was likely to simplify the classification task or to focus on a specific aspect of the data.

The dataset includes various features related to trees and internodes, though the specific meanings of these features are not provided. The binary classification target makes this dataset suitable for machine learning tasks focused on binary outcomes, such as presence/absence studies or threshold-based classifications.

It's important to note that the original source and date of this dataset are unknown, which may limit its contextual understanding and applicability. Researchers using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and the potential implications for analysis and interpretation of results.
