QSAR-TID-12787 Dataset: Economics, Life Science, MTL QSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12787. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset has ten rows and over one thousand features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pxc50. The fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule, while the median pxc50 represents the median activity value of each compound.

The FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the structure of molecules. These descriptors are widely used in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling.

The data was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.
