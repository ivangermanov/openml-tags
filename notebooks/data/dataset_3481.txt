QSAR-TID-12787 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12787. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains ten rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The target protein, Estrogen Receptor Alpha, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including transcription, cell growth, and differentiation. It is a nuclear receptor that binds to estrogen, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways.

The Estrogen Receptor Alpha is involved in various biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is also implicated in various diseases, including breast cancer, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for the Estrogen Receptor Alpha, which can be used for virtual screening, lead optimization, and drug discovery.
