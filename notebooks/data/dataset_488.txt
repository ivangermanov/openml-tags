The AAUP dataset for the ASA Statistical Graphics Section's Data Analysis Exposition contains information on faculty salaries for American colleges and universities. The data is available in two formats: a comma-delimited file with a single data line per school, and a fixed-column format with two data lines per school and a maximum line length of characters. This dataset is taken from an issue of Academe.

Faculty salary data are for a specific school year. The dataset includes variables such as Federal ID number, college name, state, institution type, average salaries and compensation for full professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and all ranks combined. It also contains the number of faculty in each rank and total faculty count.

Missing values are denoted with an asterisk. All salary and compensation figures are yearly amounts in hundreds of dollars.

The purpose of the Data Analysis Exposition is to encourage statisticians to demonstrate techniques, especially graphical, for analyzing data and displaying results. Participants work with the same dataset and present their analyses at a special session during the annual Joint Statistical Meetings.

The dataset is drawn from two sources: a guide to America's Best Colleges and the AAUP Salary Survey. It includes information on tuition, room and board costs, test scores, application and acceptance rates, graduation rates, student-faculty ratios, spending per student, and other variables for numerous schools.

Participants are encouraged to explore various analytical approaches, such as modeling tuition using other variables, clustering colleges into comparison groups, displaying faculty salary structures, or developing ranking systems for schools. They may work individually or in teams, and can focus on subsets of schools or examine regional patterns.

The main goal is to find innovative ways to display interesting features of the data. Participants may use their preferred software packages or incorporate the data into class projects.
