The SMK dataset is a collection of data related to geography and microarray analysis. This dataset was used in a study published in Nature Medicine, which focused on airway epithelial gene expression in the diagnostic evaluation of smokers with suspected lung cancer.

The SMK dataset contains a large number of features, including att two, att three, att four, and so on up to att one hundred one, as well as many others. These features are likely related to genetic data obtained through microarray analysis.

The study used this dataset to investigate the potential of airway epithelial gene expression as a diagnostic tool for lung cancer in smokers. The researchers analyzed the genetic data in the SMK dataset to identify patterns and markers that could be indicative of lung cancer.
