MiniBooNE Tags: Azure Pilot, Study Two Eighteen

This dataset is taken from the MiniBooNE experiment and is used to distinguish electron neutrinos, which are the signal, from muon neutrinos, which are the background. This dataset is ordered, with all signal observations first, followed by the background observations.

The dataset contains fifty particle identification variables for each event, which are all real values.

The MiniBooNE dataset is relevant to the paper "Boosted Decision Trees, an Alternative to Artificial Neural Networks", which discusses the use of boosted decision trees as an alternative to artificial neural networks.

The dataset does not have any missing values.

Each line in the dataset, after the first line, contains the fifty particle identification variables for one event. The first line contains the number of signal events and the number of background events.

Keywords: particle identification, neutrino detection, boosted decision trees, artificial neural networks, signal background separation.
