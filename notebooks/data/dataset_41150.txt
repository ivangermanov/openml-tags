**MiniBooNE**

Tags: Azure Pilot, Computer Systems, Manufacturing, Study Two Eighteen

This dataset is taken from the MiniBooNE experiment and is used to distinguish electron neutrinos (signal) from muon neutrinos (background). This dataset is ordered, with all signal observations coming first, followed by background observations.

The dataset information includes fifty particle identification variables for each event, which are real values. There are no missing values in this dataset.

This dataset is relevant to the paper "Boosted Decision Trees, an Alternative to Artificial Neural Networks", which discusses alternative methods to artificial neural networks for data analysis.

The dataset is set up with the number of signal events and background events listed on the first line, followed by the fifty particle identification variables for each event on subsequent lines.
