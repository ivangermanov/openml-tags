**Diabetes Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, specifically listed under discrete-verylarge models.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a complex model consisting of numerous nodes and arcs. It has a total of nodes, which are connected by arcs. The network contains a large number of parameters, indicating its complexity.

The average Markov blanket size of this network is relatively small, while the average degree is moderate. However, some nodes have a high maximum in-degree, indicating their significance in the network.

This network was designed to model the complex relationships between various factors influencing diabetes. It incorporates factors related to meals, insulin absorption, glucose production, and other physiological processes.

The network includes a wide range of features, including meal information, insulin absorption rates, glucose levels, and renal clearance rates. These features are modeled over multiple time points, allowing for an analysis of how they change and interact over time.

A Model-based Approach to Insulin Adjustment is the title of the paper that introduced this network.
