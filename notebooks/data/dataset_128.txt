Name: BNG (Cylinder Bands, Nominal) 
Tags: artificial, BNG

This dataset consists of three different types of irises (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica). It contains measurements of petal and sepal length, stored in a numpy array. The dataset includes various features related to cylinder bands and printing processes, such as:

Timestamp, cylinder number, customer information, job number, grain screening, ink color, proof on coated ink, blade manufacturer, cylinder division, paper type, ink type, direct steam application, solvent type, type on cylinder, press type, press details, unit number, cylinder size, paper mill location, plating tank specifications, proof cut, viscosity measurements, caliper readings, ink temperature, humidity levels, surface roughness, blade pressure, varnish percentage, press speed, ink percentage, solvent percentage, ESA voltage and amperage, wax content, hardener usage, roller durometer, current density, anode space ratio, chrome content, and band type.

Keywords: cylinder bands, iris classification, printing process, ink properties, paper characteristics, press parameters
