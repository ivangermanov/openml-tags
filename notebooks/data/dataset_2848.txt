Tuning SVMs 
Tags: Politics, Study 

This is a meta-dataset describing the Support Vector Machine hyperparameter tuning problem. The target attribute indicates whether tuning is required or default hyperparameter values are sufficient for each dataset (row). Targets were defined using a statistical labeling rule comparing the predictive performance of models induced with default values and tuned ones.

Features include characteristics of datasets, differences between various machine learning algorithms, simple statistics about classes and attributes, dimensionality, and other dataset properties. Additionally, there are measures of skewness, kurtosis, correlation, and information theory-based metrics. Model-based features capture aspects of decision trees, while landmarking features describe the performance of various machine learning algorithms on the datasets.
