Tecator Dataset
Tags: OpenML-Reg, study

This dataset contains information from the Tecator Infratec Food and Feed Analyzer, which operates in the near infrared wavelength range. The analyzer uses Near Infrared Transmission (NIT) principles to measure the absorbance spectrum of finely chopped pure meat samples with varying moisture, fat, and protein contents.

The task associated with this dataset is to predict the fat content of a meat sample based on its near infrared absorbance spectrum. If results from this data are used in publications, researchers are requested to mention the instrument and company name (Tecator) in their work.

The data are available in the public domain with no responsibility from the original data source. They can be redistributed as long as the permission note is attached. For more information about the instrument, interested parties can contact Perstorp Analytical's representative in their area.

The dataset consists of absorbance measurements for each meat sample across channels, along with the contents of moisture (water), fat, and protein. The absorbance is calculated as the negative logarithm (base ) of the transmittance measured by the spectrometer. The three content measurements (moisture, fat, and protein) are determined by analytic chemistry and expressed as percentages.

The complete dataset includes samples, which are divided into several subsets for model validation and extrapolation studies. These subsets include training data, monitoring data, testing data, and two extrapolation sets focusing on fat and protein content, respectively.

The spectra have been preprocessed using principal component analysis on the training dataset, with the first principal components (scaled to unit variance) included for each sample. For standard interpolation testing of algorithms, it is recommended to use the first samples for training and the subsequent samples for testing, while ignoring the last samples. The initial principal components are typically used to predict the fat content.

The data file structure includes lines containing absorbance values, principal components, and the contents of moisture, fat, and protein for each sample. The file also provides information on the number of input and output variables, as well as the number of examples in each subset of the data.

Researchers have used various neural network models to analyze this data, with performance measured by the Standard Error of Prediction (SEP). Different network architectures and methodologies, such as early stopping and Bayesian approaches, have been applied to improve prediction accuracy.

This dataset serves as a benchmark for regression models, particularly in spectroscopic analysis and food science applications. It allows for the comparison of different modeling approaches in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.
