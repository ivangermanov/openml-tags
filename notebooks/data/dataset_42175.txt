Credit Card Fraud Detection

Context
It is crucial for credit card companies to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent customers from being charged for items they did not purchase. This is essential to maintain customer trust and prevent financial losses.

Content
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, where we have fraudulent transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for a small percentage of all transactions. It contains only numerical input variables, which are the result of a Principal Component Analysis transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data.

Features
The dataset includes the time elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, as well as the transaction amount. The transaction amount can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. The response variable is the class, which takes a value of one in case of fraud and zero otherwise.

Inspiration
The goal is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the class imbalance ratio, it is recommended to measure the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve. Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

The dataset has been collected and analyzed during a research collaboration on big data mining and fraud detection.
