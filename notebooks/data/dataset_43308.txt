Fish Market Dataset

Tags: Content

This dataset is a comprehensive record of common fish species sold in fish markets. With this dataset, a predictive model can be developed using machine-friendly data to estimate the weight of fish. This can be achieved by analyzing the relationships between various physical characteristics of the fish and their corresponding weights.

Acknowledgements

We would like to extend our gratitude to all individuals who have contributed to the development of kernels using this dataset, as well as those who have viewed or downloaded the data.

Inspiration

This dataset lends itself well to multiple linear regression analysis, a fundamental practice in predictive modeling. Additionally, multivariate analysis can also be performed to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between the various characteristics of the fish.

Features

The dataset includes information on the species of fish, as well as various physical measurements such as length, height, and width.
