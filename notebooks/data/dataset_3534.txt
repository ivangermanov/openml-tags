This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID Seventeen Thousand Five, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and numerous Fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
