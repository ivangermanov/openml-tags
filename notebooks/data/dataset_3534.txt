Quality Prediction of Red Wine Based on Different Feature Sets Using Machine Learning Techniques

This research focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on various feature sets using machine learning techniques. The study aims to identify the most significant features that affect the quality of red wine.

The features used in this study include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcohol. These features were selected to represent different aspects of red wine, including its chemical composition and physical properties.

By applying machine learning algorithms to these feature sets, the study aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the quality of red wine. The quality of red wine is a complex trait that depends on multiple factors, including the grape variety, climate, soil type, and winemaking techniques.

This research has significant implications for the wine industry, as it can help winemakers identify the key factors that affect the quality of their products. By optimizing these factors, winemakers can improve the overall quality of their wines and increase customer satisfaction.
