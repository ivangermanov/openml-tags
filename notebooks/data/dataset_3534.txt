QSAR-TID-17005 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17005. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17005. The features of the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecules as a series of bits. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery.

The dataset contains a single protein target, which is the Serotonin two a receptor. This receptor is a type of G protein-coupled receptor, which is a family of receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. The receptor is also known as the five-HT two a receptor, and it is involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, including mood, appetite, and sleep.

The dataset is annotated with Gene Ontology terms, which provide a description of the biological processes and molecular functions of the receptor. The terms include plasma membrane, caveola, membrane, axon, dendrite, cytoplasmic vesicle, cell projection, synapse, and presynapse.
