Description: This dataset contains sleep state measurements of a newborn infant along with corresponding heart rate and temperature readings. The data is structured in three columns, representing heart rate, sleep state, and temperature respectively. This time series data is suitable for regression analysis and modeling of infant sleep patterns in relation to physiological indicators.

The dataset is part of a larger collection used in studies on time series analysis, particularly focusing on regression models. It provides valuable information for researchers interested in infant sleep patterns, physiological responses during sleep, and the interplay between heart rate, temperature, and sleep states in newborns.

Features: Heart rate, Sleep state, Temperature
