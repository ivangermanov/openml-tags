Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed Four Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed dataset. It was generated using a specific source code that involves uniform sampling of classes and columns, as well as stratified sampling of rows.

The dataset was created by first uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded ten, a random selection of ten classes was made, with the probability of each class being selected proportional to its frequency in the original dataset. The indices where one of these selected classes was present were then used to subset the original dataset.

Next, the dataset was uniformly sampled to select one hundred columns. If the number of columns in the subset dataset exceeded one hundred, a random selection of one hundred columns was made. The selected columns were then used to subset the dataset.

Finally, the dataset was stratified to select two thousand rows. If the number of rows in the subset dataset exceeded two thousand, a stratified sampling approach was used to select two thousand rows, with the target variable being the phase label.

The resulting dataset has two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns, and is stratified.
