Horse Colic Database

Horse Colic database containing information on surgeries performed on horses. Possible class attributes include whether the lesion is surgical, as well as outcome and lesion type details.

The database consists of two data files: one with 300 training instances and another with 68 test instances. It includes various data types such as continuous, discrete, and nominal variables, and contains missing values.

The dataset captures numerous attributes related to the horse's condition and treatment, including:

Surgery status (whether surgery was performed or medical treatment was given)
Age (adult or young)
Hospital number (a numeric identifier for each case)
Rectal temperature (in Celsius, indicating potential infection or shock)
Pulse (heart rate, reflecting cardiac condition)
Respiratory rate
Temperature of extremities (indicating peripheral circulation)
Peripheral pulse (subjective measure of circulation adequacy)
Mucous membrane color (indicating circulatory status)
Capillary refill time (clinical judgment of circulation)
Pain level (subjective assessment)
Peristalsis (gut activity)
Abdominal distension (an important parameter for assessing condition)
Nasogastric tube gas presence
Nasogastric reflux amount and pH
Rectal examination findings
Abdominal condition
Packed cell volume (red blood cell concentration)
Total protein levels (indicating dehydration)
Abdominocentesis appearance and protein levels
Outcome (lived, died, or euthanized)
Surgical lesion presence
Lesion details (site, type, subtype, and specific code)

The dataset provides comprehensive information on various clinical parameters and their significance in diagnosing and treating horse colic. It offers insights into the complex decision making process involved in determining whether surgical intervention is necessary and predicting outcomes for horses with colic.
