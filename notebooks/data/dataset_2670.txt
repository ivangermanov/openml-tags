**Data Description**
This dataset consists of historical price data of the FOREX GBP/USD from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans a period from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the FOREX market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean of the high bid and the high ask prices in the subsequent minute, relative to the mean of the high bid and high ask prices in the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases in the following minute, and false when the mean high price decreases or remains unchanged.

**Note**: This dataset is intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trade strategies should be based on predictions made on close attributes, which are also available.
