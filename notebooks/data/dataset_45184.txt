**Hailfinder Bayesian Network. Sample 9.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, and the average degree is two point three six. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Hailfinder system is a Bayesian system for forecasting severe weather. It is a complex network that takes into account various factors to predict the likelihood of hail.

The features of this network include Capabilities in Scenario, Mid-Level Lapse Rate, Wind Aloft, Low-Level Lapse Rate, Scenario Relative to AMCIN, Combined Moisture, Mean Relative Humidity, Synoptic Forcing, AM Instability Mountain, Scenario Relative to AM Instability, Morning CIN, Subjective Vertical Motion, QG Vertical Motion, Outflow from Mountain, Combined Clouds, Satellite Contour Moisture, Area of Moist Dry Air, AM Instability Wind Liability Scenario, IR Cloud Cover, Cloud Shade Convection, LIFR 12Z Density, Scenario Relative to Place Forecast, Current Propagation Convection, No Seven Micron Vertical Motion, Temperature Dissipation, Scenario, Movement Features, Instability Change, Low-Level Wind, Boundaries, Low-Level Moisture Advection, Area Meso ALS, Wind Hodograph, Latest CIN, Mountain Forecast, Date, RH Ratio, Visible Cloud Coverage, Scenario Relative to Three Four, No Thirty-Four Star Forecast, Capabilities Change, Wind Field Mountain, Instability in Mountain, Instability Scale in Scenario, Composite Place Forecast, Cloud Shade Other, Rao Contour Moisture, Morning Boundaries, R Five Forecast, Dewpoints, Combined Vertical Motion, AM Dewpoint Calculation Place, Surface Wind Shift Dissipation, AMCIN in Scenario, Wind Field Plane, Plains Forecast.
