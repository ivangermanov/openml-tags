This dataset focuses on thyroid-related medical information, including various measurements and patient characteristics. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem, where the majority class is labeled as positive and all other classes are labeled as negative. The features encompass a wide range of factors that may be relevant to thyroid conditions, such as medication usage, medical history, and laboratory test results. This dataset could be valuable for researchers and medical professionals studying thyroid disorders and developing diagnostic tools.
