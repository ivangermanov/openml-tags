QSAR-TID-101032 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101032. The dataset has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101032. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 101032, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase eleven.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase eleven is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and the AMPK signaling pathway.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the serine/threonine-protein kinase eleven. It can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization.
