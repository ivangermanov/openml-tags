**Hailfinder Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, referenced at https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-large.html#hailfinder.

The Hailfinder network has been designed to forecast severe weather conditions, particularly hail storms. It comprises fifty-six nodes connected by sixty-six arcs, with a total of twenty-six fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, while the average degree is two point three six. The maximum in-degree of any node is four.

This network has been developed to provide accurate predictions of severe weather events, taking into account various atmospheric conditions and factors. It includes a range of variables related to cloud formations, wind patterns, moisture levels, temperature, and other relevant factors.

**Features**

The network incorporates a range of features, including:

* Capacity in Scene
* Middle Level Lapse Rate
* Wind Aloft
* Lower Level Lapse Rate
* Scene Relative Atmospheric Moisture Content In
* Combined Moisture
* Mean Relative Humidity
