QSAR-TID-11711 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11711. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neprilysin, also known as Atriopeptidase, CD ten, Enkephalinase, Mme, and NEP. Neprilysin is a single protein, and it is an enzyme, a protease, a metallo protease, and a metallo protease M thirteen family.

Neprilysin is involved in various biological processes, including kidney development, placenta development, proteolysis, peptide metabolic process, learning or memory, substance P catabolic process, bradykinin catabolic process, protein processing, sensory perception of pain, protein catabolic process, lung development, hormone catabolic process, response to estrogen, creatinine metabolic process, amyloid-beta metabolic process, positive regulation of neurogenesis, neuropeptide processing, cellular response to cytokine stimulus, cellular response to UV-A, cellular response to UV-B, replicative senescence, and amyloid-beta clearance.
