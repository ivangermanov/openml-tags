Toronto Apartment Rental Price

Tags: Context

I have collected the Toronto apartment rental prices from various sources on local websites.

Content 

The dataset consists of seven columns. The number of bedrooms available is represented by the Bedroom column. The Bathroom column indicates how many bathrooms are available. The Den column specifies whether a den is available or not. The Address column provides the location of the apartment. The latitude and longitude of each location are given by the Lat and Long columns, respectively. Finally, the Price column displays the apartment rental price per month in Canadian dollars.

Inspiration 

I recommend collecting more insights from this data and presenting them visually. Predicting the apartment rental price based on the given features would be a valuable analysis.
