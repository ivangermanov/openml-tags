QSAR-TID-10959 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha is a single protein that is also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group C Member One. It is a transcription factor that is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation, and lipid metabolism.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is a valuable resource for researchers studying the activity of compounds on Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha and can be used to develop predictive models of compound activity.
