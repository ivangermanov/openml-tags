Name: Satellite Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Satellite with seed equal to zero, arguments n rows max equal to two thousand, n columns max equal to one hundred, n classes max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, n rows max, n columns max, n classes max, and stratified as parameters. It returns a dataset. The function uses numpy's random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects the x and y values from the dataset. If the number of unique classes in y is greater than n classes max, it selects n classes max classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of y. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates x and y accordingly. If the number of columns in x is greater than n columns max, it uniformly samples n columns max columns and updates x. If the number of rows in x is greater than n rows max, it uses train test split with stratification to sample n rows max rows and updates x and y. Finally, it returns a dataset with the updated x, y, categorical mask, and columns.
