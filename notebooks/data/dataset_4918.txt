**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample**

The Barley Bayesian Network is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". This network aims to represent the complex relationships between various factors affecting the production of barley.

The network consists of forty-eight nodes, eighty-four arcs, and a large number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is moderate, indicating a reasonable level of complexity in the relationships between variables. The average degree of the nodes suggests that each variable is influenced by multiple factors.

This Bayesian network repository provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on crop production, particularly those interested in reducing pesticide use. By modeling the interactions between environmental, genetic, and management factors, this network can help identify key drivers of crop yield and quality.
