QSAR-TID-11085 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11085, and it has multiple rows and numerous features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes multiple features, including molecule identifiers and class features, representing various chemical properties of the compounds.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and is based on data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The target of this dataset is the Melatonin Receptor One B, also known as Mel-One-B Receptor, Melatonin Receptor Type One B, and MTNR One B. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein.

The Melatonin Receptor One B is a membrane receptor belonging to family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in small molecule receptor activity, particularly monoamine-derivative receptor activity.

This receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, chemical synaptic transmission, glucose homeostasis, and regulation of circadian rhythms.

It is also involved in negative regulation of cGMP-mediated signaling, positive regulation of circadian sleep-wake cycle, and regulation of insulin secretion, among other processes.
