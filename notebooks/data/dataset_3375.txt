QSAR-TID-11085 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11085. The dataset has seven hundred twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11085. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has seven hundred twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Melatonin receptor one B, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as Mel-one B-R, Mel one b receptor, and Melatonin receptor type one B. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, and GoProcess. It contains information on the expression of the Melatonin receptor one B in different tissues and cells, as well as its function and biological processes.
