QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes a Receptor protein-tyrosine kinase erbB- entry, also known as CD antigen=CD, Epidermal growth factor receptor-related protein, Erbb, Neu perbB - All. The organism is Rattus norvegicus. The Protein Target Classification is Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase EGFR family.

Gene Ontology components include nucleus, cytoplasm, endosome, plasma membrane, microvillus, basal plasma membrane, endosome membrane, basolateral plasma membrane, apical plasma membrane, cytoplasmic vesicle, neuromuscular junction, ruffle membrane, ERBB:ERBB complex, presynaptic membrane, cell projection, myelin sheath, lateral loop, receptor complex, postsynaptic membrane, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm.

Gene Ontology functions encompass nucleotide binding, RNA polymerase I core binding, DNA binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane signaling receptor activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, growth factor binding, ubiquitin protein ligase binding, identical protein binding, ErbB- class receptor binding, protein-containing complex binding, protein heterodimerization activity, and Hsp protein binding.
