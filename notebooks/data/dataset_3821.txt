QSAR-TID-100856 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100856. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It has been made available for research purposes and can be cited accordingly.

The target protein is Serine Threonine Protein Kinase TBK One, also known as NAK or NF kappa B Activating Kinase. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, or protein kinase, specifically an other protein kinase in the IKK family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including the activation of innate immune response, immune system process, and inflammatory response. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, autophagy, and tumor necrosis factor mediated signaling pathway.

The protein has been shown to interact with other proteins, including von Hippel Lindau disease tumor suppressor and protein cereblon. It is also involved in the regulation of type one interferon production and is a key component of the innate immune response.
