This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand eight hundred fifty-six, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive repository of QSAR models and datasets. It is intended to facilitate the development of new QSAR models and the improvement of existing ones.

The dataset includes information about the target protein, specifically serine threonine protein kinase TBK one, also known as NAK or NF kappa B activating kinase. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including innate immune responses, inflammation, and apoptosis.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between the chemical structure of compounds and their activity on this specific target protein. It can be used to develop predictive models of compound activity, identify potential lead compounds, and optimize their properties through iterative design and testing cycles.

The fingerprints included in the dataset are FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which provide a detailed description of the chemical structure of each compound. These fingerprints can be used as input features for machine learning models, allowing for the prediction of compound activity based on their structural properties.
