The Meta-Album Plankton Dataset is a collection of images created by researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The dataset was collected using an Imaging FlowCytobot, and each image contains one or multiple planktons. The images were captured in a controlled environment and have different orientations based on the flow of the fluid in which they were captured and the size and shape of the planktons.

The preprocessed plankton dataset was prepared from the original Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Plankton dataset. The preprocessing involved creating a background squared image by either duplicating the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right most three columns based on the orientation of the original image to match the width or height of the image respectively. A Gaussian kernel of size twenty-nine by twenty-nine was applied to the background image to blur it. Finally, the original plankton image was pasted onto the background image at the center of the image. The squared background image with the original plankton image on top of it was then resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels with anti-aliasing.

### Dataset Details

The Plankton dataset has twenty classes and eight hundred images. The dataset is part of the Small Animals domain and is licensed under the MIT License. The dataset is available in image format, and each image is sized at one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels.
