Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Climb Rate, Curroll, Absolute Roll, Difference Climb, Difference Roll Rate, Difference Difference Climb, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on elevator-related measurements and classifications. It has been transformed from its original numeric format into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean value. This binarization allows for a simplified analysis of the data, potentially revealing insights that might not be as apparent in the continuous numeric form.

The features included in this dataset encompass various aspects of elevator movement and positioning, such as climb rate, roll measurements, and time-based calculations. These parameters provide a comprehensive view of elevator behavior and performance, which can be valuable for analysis, prediction, and optimization in elevator systems.
