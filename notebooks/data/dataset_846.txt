Elevators Dataset

Tags: Binarized Regression Problem, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset features include variables related to elevator performance, such as Climb Rate, Speed, Pressure, and Roll Angle, among others.
