Lymph Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting

The Lymph Dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

This dataset originally consisted of various features related to the lymphatic system, including characteristics of lymphatics, blocks of afferent vessels, and blocks of lymphatic capillaries and sinusoids. Other features included bypasses, extravasation, regeneration, early uptake, and changes in lymph nodes, structures, and special forms. Additionally, there were features related to dislocation and exclusion of nodes, as well as the number of nodes present.
