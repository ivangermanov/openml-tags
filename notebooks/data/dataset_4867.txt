The QSAR Biodegradation Dataset was built in the Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group. This research received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under the Marie Curie ITN Environmental Chemoinformatics Project.

The dataset contains experimental values of biodegradation for one thousand fifty-five chemicals, which were collected from the website of the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan. These values were used to develop Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships models for studying the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules.

Classification models were developed to discriminate between ready and not ready biodegradable molecules using three different modeling methods: k Nearest Neighbors, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines. These models were used to identify molecular descriptors that are relevant for predicting biodegradability.

Details on the molecular descriptors selected in each model can be found in the referenced journal article, which discusses the development of Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships models for ready biodegradability of chemicals.
