QSAR-TID-107 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 107. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 2778 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein is the Serotonin 2a receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, mood regulation, and appetite control.

The receptor is a key target for the treatment of various diseases, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for the Serotonin 2a receptor, which can aid in the discovery of new drugs and the optimization of existing ones.
