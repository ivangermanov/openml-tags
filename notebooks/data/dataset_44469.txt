Name: Yeast Seed One Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Yeast dataset with seed equals one, arguments include number of rows, number of columns, number of classes, and stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data.

The dataset includes features such as protein localization.
