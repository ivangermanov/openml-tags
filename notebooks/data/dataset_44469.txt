The Yeast dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of arguments. The resulting dataset has undergone uniform sampling of classes, ensuring that only a maximum number of classes are retained. This process involves selecting the indices where one of the chosen classes is present, thereby reducing the number of classes.

Uniform sampling of columns has also been applied to the dataset, ensuring that only a maximum number of columns are retained. This process involves selecting a specified number of column indices randomly and then sorting them to ensure consistency.

Furthermore, the dataset has undergone uniform sampling of rows, ensuring that only a maximum number of rows are retained. This process involves concatenating the data and target variables, followed by applying a stratified split to achieve the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original Yeast dataset, with reduced dimensions and carefully sampled data points. The dataset retains its original characteristics, including the categorical mask and column information.
