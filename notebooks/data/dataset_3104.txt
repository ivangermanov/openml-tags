QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a renal dipeptidase protein target, also known as beta lactamase, dipeptidase, DPEP, or microsomal dipeptidase. This enzyme belongs to the metallo protease M family and is found in Sus scrofa (pig). It is involved in various biological processes including proteolysis, lipid metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, glutathione catabolism, antibiotic metabolism, and cellular responses to different stimuli such as insulin, calcium ions, xenobiotics, and nitric oxide.

The protein is localized in multiple cellular components including the extracellular space, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, plasma membrane, and cell projections. Its molecular functions encompass peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, beta lactamase activity, hydrolase activity, and GPI anchor binding.

This renal dipeptidase plays roles in several important pathways, including the synthesis of leukotrienes and eoxins, as well as aflatoxin activation and detoxification. It has various protein domain classifications such as Dipep AS, Pept M, and Metal Hydrolase.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies, potentially aiding in drug discovery efforts targeting this enzyme.
