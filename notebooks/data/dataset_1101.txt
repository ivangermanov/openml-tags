The Adult dataset from the LIBSVM data repository is a collection of data related to Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset was preprocessed from the original Adult data set, which had fourteen features, including six continuous and eight categorical features. 

In this dataset, continuous features were discretized into quantiles, and each quantile is represented by a binary feature. Additionally, a categorical feature with multiple categories was converted to multiple binary features. 

Details on how each feature was converted can be found in the beginning of each file from the research website.

Features include age, work class, education level, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country, among others.
