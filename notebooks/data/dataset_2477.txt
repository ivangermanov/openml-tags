The Multiple Features Dataset: Pixel is one of a set of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. The maps were scanned in eight-bit gray value at a density of four hundred dots per inch, then sharpened and thresholded. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. Two hundred instances per class, for a total of two thousand instances, have been digitized in binary images. 

Using this dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained. The dataset represents two hundred forty pixel averages in two by three windows.

A slightly different version of the database was used in a paper about handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers. The database as is was used in a review of statistical pattern recognition.

The attributes include the class and pixel averages.
