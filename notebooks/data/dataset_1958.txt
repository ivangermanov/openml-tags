The QSAR-TID-100613 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100613. This dataset has fifty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains information about the proteasome macropain subunit, also known as multicatalytic endopeptidase complex subunit C seven-I, proteasome component C seven-I, and proteasome subunit beta type-two. It is an enzyme/protease/threonine protease/threonine protease PBT clan/threonine protease T one-A subfamily.

This protein target classification is one enzyme/protease/threonine protease/threonine protease PBT clan/threonine protease T one-A subfamily.

It is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms include macropain subunit C seven-I, multicatalytic endopeptidase complex subunit C seven-I, proteasome component C seven-I, and proteasome subunit beta type-two.

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and its organism is Homo sapiens.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, proteasome, macropain subunit, threonine protease.
