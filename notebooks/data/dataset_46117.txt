This dataset, known as Dominick, contains a large collection of weekly time series data representing the profit of individual stock keeping units from a retailer. The dataset consists of three columns: the identifier of a time series, the value of the time series at a specific time step, and the time step on the time series. 

It is unclear which specific file from the original source was used to create this dataset. Unfortunately, the original dataset did not include a record of the dates corresponding to the time steps. 

The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps. The column names were renamed to make them more descriptive. The value column was exploded, and a new time step column was created from the resulting data. The identifier of a time series was defined as a categorical variable, and the value was cast as a floating-point number.

The dataset features include the identifier of a time series and the value of the time series at a specific time step.
