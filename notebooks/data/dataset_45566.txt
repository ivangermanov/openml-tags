At Santander, our mission is to help individuals and businesses thrive. We are constantly seeking innovative ways to assist our customers in understanding their financial well-being and identifying which products and services could aid them in achieving their monetary objectives.

Our data science team continuously challenges our machine learning algorithms, collaborating with the global data science community to ensure we can more accurately identify novel solutions to our most prevalent challenge, binary classification problems, such as determining whether a customer is satisfied, predicting if a customer will purchase a particular product, and assessing whether a customer can repay a loan.

The Santander Customer Satisfaction dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises various features including variables related to customer transactions.

By leveraging this dataset, we aim to develop more effective methods for predicting customer satisfaction, thereby enabling us to provide tailored support and enhance overall customer experience.
