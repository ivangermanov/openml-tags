GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be used for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets are valuable for estimating various quality metrics such as accuracy, precision, and area under ROC curve for classification, feature selection, and clustering algorithms. The repository was created in response to a growing need in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems. This enables researchers to compare different classification and feature selection techniques using a consistent set of datasets.

The gene expression samples in the GEMLeR repository originate from the publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository, maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The expO project aims to collect tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on clinically annotated, deidentified tumor samples. The resulting data is released into the public domain without intellectual property restrictions, providing benefits to patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on several factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of a uniform microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype phenotype studies, and the large number of samples available for various tumor types.

When publishing research based on GEMLeR datasets, it is important to acknowledge the assistance received from this repository. This helps others to obtain the same datasets and replicate experiments. Researchers are also encouraged to acknowledge the contribution of the Expression Project for Oncology and the International Genomics Consortium for making their gene expression samples publicly available.

The GEMLeR repository contains numerous features, including various gene identifiers and expression data points. These features are typically represented by alphanumeric codes and may not be easily interpretable without domain specific knowledge.
