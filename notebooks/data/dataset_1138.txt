GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets specifically designed for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets enable the estimation of various quality metrics, including accuracy, precision, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from the growing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems. This allows researchers to compare and contrast different classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository managed by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The resulting tumor data is updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions.

The availability of this information translates directly into benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike. 

Although numerous other sources of gene expression data exist, the decision to utilize data from the expO repository was made due to several key factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the accessibility of a large number of samples for various tumor types.

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, please acknowledge the assistance received by utilizing this repository. This enables others to obtain the same datasets and replicate experiments.
