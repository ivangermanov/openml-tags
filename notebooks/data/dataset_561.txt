The CPU dataset contains information on relative CPU performance. It was originally used for numeric prediction using instance-based learning with encoding length selection. The dataset includes attributes such as vendor name, machine cycle time, minimum and maximum main memory, cache memory, minimum and maximum channels, published relative performance, and estimated relative performance.

The estimated relative performance values were calculated using a linear regression method. The dataset comprises instances with various predictive attributes, non-predictive attributes, a goal field, and the linear regression's estimate. There are no missing attribute values in this dataset.

The vendor names include a wide range of computer manufacturers such as Amdahl, Apollo, BASF, Burroughs, CDC, DEC, Honeywell, HP, IBM, and many others. The model names consist of numerous unique symbols. Machine cycle time is measured in nanoseconds, while memory attributes are measured in kilobytes. Channel attributes are measured in units.

The published relative performance (PRP) serves as the class value and is continuously valued. The PRP values range from to over, with the majority of instances falling in the range. Summary statistics for various attributes show correlations with the PRP, with maximum main memory having the highest correlation.

Past usage of this dataset includes linear regression prediction of relative CPU performance, which recorded an average deviation from actual values. Instance-based prediction methods have also been applied to this dataset with similar results, requiring no transformations.

This dataset provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners interested in computer performance analysis, machine learning applications in hardware evaluation, and comparative studies of different CPU models and manufacturers.
