Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This conversion enables a more straightforward analysis of the data. The dataset includes various features that describe the characteristics of fruit flies, including their Partners, Type, Thorax, and Sleep patterns. These features provide valuable insights into the biology and behavior of these organisms.
