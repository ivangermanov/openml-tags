Relative CPU Performance Data

This dataset provides information about the relative performance of different computer systems. It contains data on various characteristics of these systems, including the vendor, model name, machine cycle time, minimum and maximum main memory, cache memory, minimum and maximum channels, and published and estimated relative performance.

The dataset was created using a linear regression method to estimate the relative performance values. This method is described in detail in the original article.

There are two hundred nine instances in this dataset, each representing a different computer system. Each instance has ten attributes, including six predictive attributes, two non-predictive attributes, one goal field, and the linear regression's guess.

The attributes include vendor name, model name, machine cycle time in nanoseconds, minimum main memory in kilobytes, maximum main memory in kilobytes, cache memory in kilobytes, minimum channels in units, maximum channels in units, published relative performance, and estimated relative performance from the original article.

There are no missing attribute values in this dataset. The class distribution is continuous, with published relative performance values ranging from zero to over one thousand.

Summary statistics are available for each attribute, including minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and correlation with published relative performance.

This dataset has been used in previous studies, including linear regression prediction of relative CPU performance and instance-based prediction of real-valued attributes.
