QSAR-TID-12244
MTLQSAR, study_3
MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12244. It has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID
