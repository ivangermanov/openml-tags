Covertype 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is used in the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same manner. It belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

The original Covertype dataset has been sourced from the LibSVM repository. 

To use this dataset, please cite the relevant paper, which describes the binarization process employed. 

This is the famous Covertype dataset in its binary version, retrieved from the LibSVM site. In addition to the preprocessing done previously, this dataset was created as follows: 

Firstly, the Covertype dataset was loaded in its unscaled form. Then, each file column was normalized according to specific rules. 

Columns containing only one value, known as constant features, were set to zero and subsequently removed due to sparsity. 

Columns containing two values, referred to as binary features, had the most frequently occurring value set to zero, while the other value was set to one. 

Finally, columns containing more than two values, including multinomial and real features, were divided by their standard deviation. 

Duplicate lines were ultimately removed from the dataset. 

Preprocessing involved transforming the dataset from multiclass to binary class.
