QSAR-TID-12244 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12244. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains ten rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The drug target TID: 12244 is also known as Estrogen Receptor Beta, which is a single protein and a transcription factor/nuclear receptor/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 3/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 3 group A/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 3 group A member 2. It is involved in various biological processes, including transcription, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against Estrogen Receptor Beta.
