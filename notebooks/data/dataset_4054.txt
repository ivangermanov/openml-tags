The QSAR-TID-11168 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11168. This dataset has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target gastrin-releasing peptide receptor.

The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor is a single protein, also known as gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, GRP-preferring bombesin receptor, GRPR, and GRP-R. It is a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, learning or memory, social behavior, psychomotor behavior, and regulation of cell population proliferation.
