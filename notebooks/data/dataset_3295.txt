This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12933. It has thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and many others.

Scraped data includes type single protein preferred name cathepsin B synonyms cathepsin B, cathepsin B one, cathepsin B heavy chain, cathepsin B light chain, ctsb, and others. Organism is rattus norvegicus species group no protein target classification one enzyme protease cysteine protease cysteine protease ca clan cysteine protease c one a family description relationship accession cathepsin B single protein p zero seven eight seven.
