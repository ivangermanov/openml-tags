QSAR-TID-12077 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12077. The dataset has fifty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 Alpha. The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 Alpha is a Single Protein, also known as CRK one, Csbp one, Csbp two, Mapk fourteen, and MAPK fourteen. It is an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase MAPK family/CMGC protein kinase p38 subfamily.

The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 Alpha is involved in various biological processes, including DNA damage checkpoint signaling, MAPK cascade, cell morphogenesis, cartilage condensation, angiogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and placenta development. It is also involved in response to dietary excess, chondrocyte differentiation, glucose metabolic process, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction of biological activities of small molecules.
