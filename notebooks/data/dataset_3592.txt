QSAR-TID-12077 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12077, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September 2015. 

Scraped Data:
