The QSAR-TID-17147 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Seventeen. This dataset has eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent Folded Circular Fingerprint 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. The Matrix Metalloproteinase Seventeen protein is a single protein enzyme that belongs to the metallo protease MAM clan and metallo protease M10A subfamily.

This enzyme plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including kidney development, proteolysis, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, and drinking behavior. It is also involved in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases.

The Folded Circular Fingerprint 1024-bit molecular fingerprints used in this dataset do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. However, the feature names are not human-readable and consist of alphanumeric characters.
