Adult Census Income Tags: This data was extracted from the Census Bureau database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: the person's age is sixteen or older, their annual gross income is one hundred or more, their final weight is one or more, and they work zero hours per week. The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over fifty thousand dollars a year.

Description of Final Weight: The weights on the Current Population Survey files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. These are prepared monthly by the Population Division at the Census Bureau. We use three sets of controls. These are: a single cell estimate of the population sixteen and older for each state; controls for Hispanic origin by age and sex; and controls by race, age, and sex. We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and "rake" through them multiple times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from the Current Population Survey by creating "weighted tallies" of any specified socioeconomic characteristics of the population. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the Current Population Survey sample is actually a collection of fifty-one state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state.
