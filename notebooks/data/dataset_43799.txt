Tags: 21+ years of the euro

It wasn't until 1999 that the euro really began its journey, when eleven countries - Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain - fixed their exchange rates and created a new currency with monetary policy passed to the European Central Bank. Today, the euro is over twenty years old.
