Subsampling of the dataset Volkert with Seed Three 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Volkert 

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the dataset by uniformly selecting classes, then sampling columns and finally sampling rows while maintaining class balance.

The function takes in parameters including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and whether to perform stratified sampling.

First, it selects classes uniformly based on their frequency in the dataset, ensuring that the selected classes represent the overall class distribution. 

Then, it selects columns uniformly, choosing the specified number of columns randomly. 

Finally, it samples rows while maintaining class balance using stratified sampling, ensuring that the resulting dataset has the desired number of rows while preserving the class distribution.
