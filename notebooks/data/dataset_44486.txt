Australian Seed Three Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Australian with seed equal to three, arguments number of rows maximum equal to two thousand, arguments number of columns maximum equal to one hundred, arguments number of classes maximum equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as parameters. It returns a dataset. The random number generator is set with the given seed. The input data x and y are taken from the original dataset. The unique classes in y are found and if there are more classes than the maximum allowed, a random selection of classes is made based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices where these selected classes are present are found and used to subset the data x and y. If the number of columns in x is more than the maximum allowed, a random selection of columns is made and the data x is subsetted accordingly. If the number of rows in x is more than the maximum allowed, the data is split using train test split with stratification based on the target variable y. The categorical columns are converted to string format and the dataset is returned with the subsetted data x, y, categorical mask, and columns.
