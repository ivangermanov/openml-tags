Sub sampling of the dataset Australian with a specified seed value. This sub sampling process involves reducing the number of rows, columns, and classes in the original dataset while maintaining the overall characteristics of the data. The goal is to create a smaller, more manageable dataset that still accurately represents the original data.

The sub sampling process begins by selecting a specified number of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection is made based on the frequency of each class. This ensures that the sampled classes are representative of the overall distribution of classes in the original dataset.

Next, the sub sampling process selects a specified number of columns from the original dataset. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection is made without replacement. This ensures that the sampled columns are diverse and representative of the overall characteristics of the data.

Finally, the sub sampling process selects a specified number of rows from the sampled columns and classes. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, a stratified sampling approach is used to ensure that the sampled rows are representative of the overall distribution of classes in the original dataset.

The resulting sub sampled dataset is a smaller, more manageable version of the original dataset that still accurately represents the overall characteristics of the data. This sub sampled dataset can be used for machine learning model training and testing, allowing for faster and more efficient development of predictive models.
