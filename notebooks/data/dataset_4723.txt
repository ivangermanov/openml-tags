Subsampling of the dataset Guillermo with a specified set of parameters resulted in a new dataset. This process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring a maximum number of classes were selected. The indices where one of these classes was present were identified, and the corresponding data points were extracted.

Uniform sampling of columns was also performed, selecting a specified maximum number of columns. The column indices were randomly chosen, and the selected columns were used to create a new dataset.

If the resulting dataset still had too many rows, stratified sampling was applied to reduce the number of rows while maintaining class balance. This was achieved using a stratified split function, which ensured that the class distribution was preserved.

The resulting dataset consisted of the sampled data points, along with their corresponding categorical mask and column information.
