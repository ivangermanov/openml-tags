APS Failure Seed Zero Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the APS Failure dataset, generated with a seed of zero. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset with specific characteristics.

The dataset has two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns. The classes were sampled uniformly, and the columns were selected randomly. The rows were then stratified accordingly to ensure a balanced representation of each class.

The dataset features include various attributes, such as acceleration, angular velocity, and other sensor readings. These features are important for predicting the failure of APS systems.

The dataset was generated using a specific source code, which involved several steps, including uniform sampling of classes, columns, and rows, as well as stratification to ensure a balanced dataset.
