The Audiology Dataset, tagged as Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, features a comprehensive collection of characteristics related to hearing and auditory health.

This dataset focuses on individuals over the age of sixty, who have experienced various symptoms such as buzzing, dizziness, fluctuating hearing, fullness, hereditary hearing loss, nausea, noise sensitivity, recruitment, ringing, roaring, and vomiting.

In terms of audiological tests, the dataset includes results from Air Bone Gap, Bone Abnormality, and Tymp tests, as well as measurements of Middle Wave and Late Wave responses. Additionally, it covers Speech Recognition, Static Normal Hearing, and Seventh Nerve Signs.

The dataset also explores the relationship between hearing loss and Modulated Tones, including Mixed Modulation, Low-Frequency Modulation, and High-Frequency Modulation. Furthermore, it examines Notch 4K, a specific type of hearing loss characterized by a sudden decrease in hearing ability at 4 kHz frequencies.
