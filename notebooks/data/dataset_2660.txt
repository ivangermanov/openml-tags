This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex EUR/HKD currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one hourly candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high price of the following hour, relative to the mean high price of the current hour. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is increasing in the following hour, and false when the mean high price is decreasing or remains unchanged in the following hour.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading strategies. Realistic trade strategies require predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.
