**Dataset Description**

The Sarcos dataset relates to an inverse dynamics problem for a seven degrees-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm. The task is to map from a twenty-one-dimensional input space, consisting of seven joint positions, seven joint velocities, and seven joint accelerations, to the corresponding seven joint torques. Usually, the first of those is used as the target variable and is therefore set as the default target variable, while the other six joint torques are excluded from the model.

**Note**

This dataset contains only the corresponding training data, as there is data leakage between the original training and test data. This issue was described in an article by DataRobot, highlighting the importance of careful data handling.

**Related Studies**

Several studies have utilized this dataset, including research on incremental real-time learning in high-dimensional space, statistical learning for humanoid robots, and incremental online learning in high dimensions. Additionally, more recent studies have applied cascaded Gaussian processes for data-efficient robot dynamics learning and attentive interpretable tabular learning.

**Citation**

The original paper on incremental real-time learning in high-dimensional space is a seminal work in this field.
