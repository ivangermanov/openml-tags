Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample 10.

The Alarm Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium Bayesian network repository reference. 

This network has a total of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred and nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, and the average degree is approximately two point four nine. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Alarm Bayesian Network is a case study with two probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks.
