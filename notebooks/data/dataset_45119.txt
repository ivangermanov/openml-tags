Alarm Bayesian Network Sample. This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository and can be found in the discrete medium section.

The Alarm Bayesian Network is a case study featuring two probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. It has been used to model the Alarm monitoring system, which is a medical diagnosis system designed to monitor patients in postoperative care units.

The network consists of thirty-seven nodes, forty-six arcs, and five hundred nine parameters. On average, each node has a Markov blanket size of approximately three point five one and an average degree of two point four nine. The maximum in-degree of any node is four.

This network has been cited in various publications, including the Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, where it was presented as a case study demonstrating the application of probabilistic inference techniques to belief networks.

Some of the key features of this network include Disconnect, Insufficient Anesthesia, Pulmonary Artery Pressure, History, and Partial Pressure of Arterial Oxygen.
