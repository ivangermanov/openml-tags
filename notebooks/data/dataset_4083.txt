QSAR Fish Toxicity Dataset
Tags: Computer Systems, Mathematics

This dataset was developed to create quantitative regression QSAR models that can predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales Promelas, also known as fathead minnow, on a set of chemicals. The prediction of toxicity is crucial in understanding the potential harm caused by these substances to aquatic life.

The dataset comprises six molecular descriptors and one quantitative experimental response, namely LC fifty, which represents the concentration that causes death in fifty percent of test fish over a test duration of ninety-six hours. These molecular descriptors include Molecular LogP, Constitutional Indices, two-dimensional Autocorrelations, Atom-Type Counts, and two-dimensional Matrix-Based Descriptors. 

A detailed explanation of this dataset can be found in the referenced research paper, which describes the development of a similarity-based QSAR model for predicting acute toxicity towards the fathead minnow.
