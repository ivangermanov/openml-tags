This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex CHF/JPY exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans a period from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is inactive during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent minute relative to the mean high price of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true if the mean high price increases in the following minute, and false if the mean high price decreases or remains unchanged.

Please note that this dataset serves solely for scientific purposes and should not be used for actual trading decisions. Realistic trade strategies require predicting the close attributes, which are also available.
