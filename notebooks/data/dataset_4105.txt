QSAR-TID-101301 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101301. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101301. The features of the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecules as a series of bits. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery.

The dataset contains a single protein target, which is a P2Y purinoceptor one. This target is a membrane receptor that is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction and monoatomic ion transport.
