Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains various geographical, demographic, and banking-related features. These include coordinates, population statistics, temperature data, and banking efficiency metrics. The specific feature names have been omitted due to their technical nature.

This dataset is a modified version of an original banking dataset. The key transformation involves converting a continuous numeric target variable into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the original target variable and then categorizing all instances below this mean as positive ('P') and all instances above as negative ('N'). This binarization process allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies and is tagged for use in mythbusting exercises. It provides an opportunity to explore how transforming a regression problem into a classification task can affect analysis and model performance. Researchers and data scientists can use this dataset to compare and contrast approaches between regression and classification methodologies in the context of banking and demographic data.
