This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10624. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was generated as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It should be cited when used.

Demographics information includes the drug target TID: 10624. 

MTLQSAR is a type of QSAR analysis. 

Study three was conducted as part of this project.

The dataset contains numerous features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID. The remaining features are molecular fingerprints and are not easily human-readable.

Scraped data includes information about the serotonin five-a receptor, also known as five-HT-five-a receptor. It is a single protein and its preferred name is serotonin five-a receptor. Other names for this receptor include five-HT-five, five-HT-five-A, and five-hydroxytryptamine receptor five-A. It is found in humans and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G-protein coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.
