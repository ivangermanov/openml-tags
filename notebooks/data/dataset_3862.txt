QSAR-TID-10624 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10624. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Serotonin 5a receptor, which is a single protein target that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors.

The Serotonin 5a receptor is a membrane receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and signal transduction. It is expressed in the brain and other tissues, and is involved in the regulation of mood, appetite, and sleep, among other functions.

The dataset contains activity values for multiple compounds, which were obtained from the ChEMBL database. The activity values are expressed in terms of pseudo-pCI50, which is a measure of the potency of a compound in inhibiting the target receptor.

The features of the dataset include the Molecule ChEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each compound, and the Median PXc50, which is a measure of the activity of each compound. The dataset also includes multiple FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that captures the structural and chemical properties of each compound.
