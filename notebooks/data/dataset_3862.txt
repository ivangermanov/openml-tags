NYC Uber Pickups with Weather and Holidays 

Tags: Statistics, Transportation 

This is a forked subset of the Uber Pickups in New York City, enriched with weather, borough, and holidays information. 

I created this dataset for a personal project of exploring and predicting pickups in the area by merging data that intuitively seem like possible factors for the analysis. These include Uber Pickups in New York City, from January first to June thirtieth, enriched with weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information, location ID to borough mapping, and New York City public holidays.

The main dataset contained a large number of observations of several variables, which were aggregated per hour and borough, and then joined with the rest of the datasets, producing a substantial number of observations across multiple variables. 

These variables include the time period of the observations, the New York City borough, the number of pickups for the period, wind speed in miles per hour, visibility in miles to the nearest tenth, temperature in Fahrenheit, dew point in Fahrenheit, sea level pressure, one-hour liquid precipitation, six-hour liquid precipitation, twenty-four-hour liquid precipitation, snow depth in inches, and whether it was a holiday or not.
