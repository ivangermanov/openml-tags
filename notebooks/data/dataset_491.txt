The Friedman datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is particularly useful for generating data as it allows for the creation of complex relationships between variables.

To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output, allowing researchers to test the ability of algorithms to ignore irrelevant information. Furthermore, to measure an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. Collinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are varied to create a range of scenarios. The number of features ranges from a small set of five to a larger set of one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output. The rest are completely random. Similarly, the number of samples varies from a small set of one hundred to a larger set of one thousand.

Collinearity degrees also vary, ranging from zero to four. For datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees.
