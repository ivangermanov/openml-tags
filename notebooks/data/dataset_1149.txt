The Madelon dataset is an artificial collection of data points grouped into thirty-two clusters placed on the vertices of a five-dimensional hypercube and randomly labeled positive one or negative one. The five dimensions constitute five informative features. Fifteen linear combinations of those features were added to form a set of twenty redundant informative features. Based on those twenty features, one must separate the examples into two classes corresponding to the plus minus one labels. A number of distractor features called probes having no predictive power were added. The order of the features and patterns were randomized. 

This dataset is one of five datasets used in the feature selection challenge. The original data was split into training, validation, and test sets. Target values are provided only for the first two sets, not for the test set. So, this dataset version contains all the examples from the training and validation partitions. There is no attribute information provided to avoid biasing the feature selection process.

Relevant papers collected in the book describe the best challenge entrants. Competitive baseline methods set new standards for the feature selection benchmark.
