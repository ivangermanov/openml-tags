This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one two six eight eight, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings they were obtained using the pipeline pilot program dassault systemes biovia generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the metaqsar project and was released in september two thousand fifteen it contains qsar data from chembl version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target tid one two six eight eight.

Tid one two six eight eight is also known as five hydroxytryptamine receptor two b it belongs to the protein family serotonin two receptor and is involved in various biological processes such as neural crest cell migration positive regulation of cytokine production and heart morphogenesis.

The dataset has been used for machine learning and qsar studies and provides a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and development.
