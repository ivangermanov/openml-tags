QSAR-TID-12688 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12688. The dataset has two hundred thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12688. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the five-hydroxytryptamine receptor two B, which is a protein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including neural transmission and smooth muscle contraction.

The five-hydroxytryptamine receptor two B is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin. It is involved in various physiological processes, including neural transmission, smooth muscle contraction, and platelet aggregation. The receptor is also implicated in various diseases, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the five-hydroxytryptamine receptor two B. It can be used to develop and validate QSAR models, which can help to predict the activity of new compounds and identify potential leads for further development.
