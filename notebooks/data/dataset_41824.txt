**Data Description**

This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EUR GBP currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one hourly candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is defined as the direction of the mean of the close bid and close ask prices of the subsequent hour, relative to the mean of the close bid and close ask prices of the current hour.
