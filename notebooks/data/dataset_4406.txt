Subsampling of the dataset Electricity with a specified seed value generated a new dataset with reduced number of rows, columns, and classes while maintaining the original characteristics.

The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset until the desired number of classes was reached. The corresponding indices were then used to select the relevant data points. Next, the columns were uniformly sampled until the desired number of columns was reached.

To ensure the dataset remained representative, stratified sampling was employed to select the final data points. This approach ensured that the distribution of classes in the subsampled dataset mirrored that of the original dataset.

Features of the resulting dataset include date, day, period, price, demand, and transfer information, as well as a classification variable.
