The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is closed on Saturdays and Sundays. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe Amsterdam timezone.

The dataset consists of daily candlesticks, each representing the Bid and Ask prices at various points throughout the trading day. The Bid Open, High, Low, and Close prices reflect the best available price at which traders were willing to buy the currency pair, while the Ask Open, High, Low, and Close prices reflect the best available price at which traders were willing to sell. Additionally, the Bid Volume and Ask Volume represent the number of times the respective prices changed within the given time interval.
