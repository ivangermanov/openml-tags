QSAR-TID-17073 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin One Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP features.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset.

The Neurokinin One Receptor is a single protein, also known as NK-One R, NK-One Receptor, SPR, Substance-P Receptor, and TAC One R. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

The receptor is located in the plasma membrane, membrane, sperm flagellum, sperm head, cell periphery, and sperm midpiece. It has functions such as G protein-coupled receptor activity, tachykinin receptor activity, and substance P receptor activity.
