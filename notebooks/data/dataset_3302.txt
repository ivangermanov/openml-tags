This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-17073, falls under the categories of Machine Learning, Medicine, and MTLQSAR. It originates from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset comprises QSAR data derived from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values measured in pseudo-pCI50 units for various compounds acting on the drug target identified as TID: 17073. This collection consists of three hundred ninety-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature denoted as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings utilizing the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Typically, generating fingerprints does not necessitate the imputation of missing values, as all bits are produced during this process.

This dataset pertains to the Neurokinin One Receptor, also referred to as the Substance-P Receptor, NK-One R, NK-One Receptor, SPR, and Tachykinin Receptor. It belongs to the species Cavia porcellus and falls under the classification of Membrane Receptors, specifically Family A G-Protein Coupled Receptors and Peptide Receptors.

Keywords: QSAR, Machine Learning, Medicine, MTLQSAR, Neurokinin One Receptor, Substance-P Receptor, G-Protein Coupled Receptors, Peptide Receptors.
