QSAR-TID-101097
Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study 3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101097. It has fifty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
