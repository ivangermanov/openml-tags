Internet Advertisements Seed Zero Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Internet Advertisements dataset, with a seed value of zero. It was generated using a specific source code that uniformly samples classes and columns from the original dataset.

The dataset features a total of one hundred columns, with ten classes. The features include various URL components, such as images, buttons, and domains, as well as other attributes like original URLs and anchor curl redirects.

The dataset was subsampled using a stratified approach, ensuring that the selected classes and columns are representative of the original dataset. The subsampling process involved selecting a random subset of classes and columns, and then further reducing the dataset to meet the specified row and column limits.

The resulting dataset is a balanced and representative sample of the original Internet Advertisements dataset, with a focus on URL-based features and attributes.
