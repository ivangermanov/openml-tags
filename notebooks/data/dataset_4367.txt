Subsampling of the dataset KDD IPUMS LA Ninety Seven Small with a specific seed generated a new dataset. This new dataset is a statistically significant representation of the original dataset, with a focus on education and statistics.

The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the new dataset had a balanced representation of all classes. The number of classes was capped to prevent any single class from dominating the dataset.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. This step helped to eliminate any redundant or irrelevant features, resulting in a more concise and meaningful dataset.

Finally, the rows were sampled using a stratified approach to ensure that the new dataset retained the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This step guaranteed that the new dataset was a representative sample of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a range of features, including value, rent, family size, number of children, occupation score, and income-related variables. These features provide a comprehensive understanding of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population.
