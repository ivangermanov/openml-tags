Subsampling of the dataset Albert with Seed Equal to Two

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Albert dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset.

The original dataset had a large number of classes, but only ten were selected for this subsampled version. These classes were chosen randomly, with probability proportional to their frequency in the original dataset.

Similarly, the number of columns was reduced to one hundred, again through uniform random sampling. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a good representation of the original features.

Finally, the number of rows was limited to two thousand, with stratified sampling used to ensure that the class distribution remains consistent.

Computer Systems and Statistics are the primary tags associated with this dataset.
