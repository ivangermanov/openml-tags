Name: QSAR-TID Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information on the Bradykinin B receptor, also known as B bradykinin receptor, BR, BDKRB, BK receptor, and BRADYB. This receptor is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It is classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein-coupled receptor category, specifically a peptide receptor and short peptide receptor in the bradykinin receptor family.

The Bradykinin B receptor is associated with various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, cell migration, and regulation of blood pressure. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and other membrane structures. The receptor's functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, bradykinin receptor activity, protein binding, and peptide binding.

Several small molecule compounds have been studied as Bradykinin B receptor antagonists, including BI, Safotibant, and MK. These compounds have reached various phases of development in drug discovery and clinical trials.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, allowing researchers to investigate the relationship between molecular structures and their biological activities against the Bradykinin B receptor target.
