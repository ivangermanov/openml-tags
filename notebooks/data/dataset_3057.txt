QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo-pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a bacterial leucyl aminopeptidase from Vibrio proteolyticus. This single protein target is classified as an enzyme in the metallo protease family, specifically the metallo protease M28A subfamily. It is associated with various Gene Ontology terms, including extracellular region localization, aminopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, metalloexopeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, and involvement in proteolysis.

The target protein is linked to multiple database entries, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is characterized by several protein domains and families, such as Peptidase C arc/bac, Peptidase M28, and Peptidase M28E Ap1. Numerous protein structures are available in the Protein Data Bank, providing structural insights into this enzyme.

This QSAR dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and serves as a valuable resource for studying structure-activity relationships of compounds targeting bacterial leucyl aminopeptidase. The data can be used for developing predictive models and understanding molecular interactions with this important enzymatic target.
