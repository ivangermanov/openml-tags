Please cite: Dataset from the LIBSVM data repository. Preprocessing: for the SVMlin project.

Features: [List of numerous attributes omitted for brevity]

This dataset originates from the LIBSVM data repository and has undergone preprocessing for the SVMlin project. The features consist of a large number of attributes, each denoted by "att" followed by a number. These attributes likely represent various characteristics or measurements relevant to the dataset's subject matter. The exact nature and meaning of these attributes are not specified in the provided information.

The real-sim dataset appears to be a binary classification dataset, given its inclusion in the LIBSVM repository's binary section. It may be used for machine learning tasks, particularly those involving support vector machines (SVMs). The dataset's name suggests it might involve real-world simulations or data, though specific details about its content or application are not provided.

Researchers or practitioners using this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, acknowledging its origin from the LIBSVM data repository. The preprocessing steps undertaken for the SVMlin project may have enhanced or modified the data to make it more suitable for certain machine learning applications.
