The QSAR-TID-10167 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10167. This dataset has eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit one, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit two, and so on up to nine hundred twenty-six more features.

This dataset was scraped from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains information about the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor three, also known as GPRC one C, GRM three, mGluR three, and MGLUR three. This receptor is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms include Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor three and others.

The organism associated with this receptor is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group of no protein target classification. The protein target classification is one point membrane receptor slash family C G protein-coupled receptor slash small molecule receptor slash neurotransmitter receptor.

The description of this receptor includes its relationship and accession Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor three Single Protein Q one four eight thirty-two. There are four records associated with this receptor, including Decoglurant, LY two nine six nine eight two two, LY four zero four zero three nine, and Pomaglumetad Methionil.
