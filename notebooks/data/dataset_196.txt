Title: Auto Mpg Data 

Sources: 
This dataset was taken from the Stat Lib library, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the nineteen eighty-three American Statistical Association Exposition.

Past Usage: 
This dataset was previously used in various studies, including one by an author who combined instance-based and model-based learning.

Relevant Information: 
This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the Stat Lib library. Eight of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the miles per gallon attribute. The original dataset is available in the file auto mpg data original. The data concerns city cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of three multivalued discrete and five continuous attributes.

Number of Instances: 
There are three hundred ninety-eight instances in this dataset.

Number of Attributes: 
There are nine attributes in total, including the class attribute.

Attribute Information: 
The first attribute is miles per gallon, which is continuous. The second attribute is cylinders, which is multivalued discrete. The third attribute is displacement, which is continuous. The fourth attribute is horsepower, which is continuous. The fifth attribute is weight, which is continuous. The sixth attribute is acceleration, which is continuous. The seventh attribute is model year, which is multivalued discrete. The eighth attribute is origin, which is multivalued discrete. The ninth attribute is car name, which is a unique string for each instance.

Missing Attribute Values: 
Horsepower has six missing values.

Features: 
The features in this dataset include cylinders, displacement, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.
