Auto-Mpg Dataset
Tags: study_130

This dataset, originally from the StatLib library at Carnegie Mellon University, was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. It has been slightly modified from its original form, with eight instances removed due to unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The data pertains to city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, which is to be predicted based on three multivalued discrete attributes and five continuous attributes.

The dataset contains 398 instances and nine attributes, including the class attribute. The attributes are as follows:

Miles per gallon (mpg): continuous
Cylinders: multivalued discrete
Displacement: continuous
Horsepower: continuous (with six missing values)
Weight: continuous
Acceleration: continuous
Model year: multivalued discrete
Origin: multivalued discrete
Car name: string (unique for each instance)

This dataset has been used in various machine learning studies, including research on combining instance-based and model-based learning. It provides a rich source of information for predicting fuel consumption based on various vehicle characteristics.

The data has been employed in numerous academic papers and machine learning experiments, demonstrating its value in the field of automotive performance prediction and analysis. Researchers have utilized this dataset to develop and test various predictive models, exploring the relationships between vehicle attributes and fuel efficiency.
