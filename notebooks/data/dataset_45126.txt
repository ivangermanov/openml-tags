**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample 6**

This Bayesian network repository reference is categorized under discrete-medium models.

The Barley Bayesian Network consists of forty-eight nodes connected by eighty-four arcs, requiring one hundred fourteen thousand and five parameters to define its structure. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is around three point five. The maximum in-degree of any node is four.

This preliminary model was developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". It aims to provide insights into the complex relationships between various factors affecting barley production.

Some of the key variables included in this model are Protein Content, Sort Size, and Nitrogen Content, among others.
