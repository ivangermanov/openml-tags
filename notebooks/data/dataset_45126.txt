**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample 6.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education. The Barley Bayesian Network is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides".

The network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree of the network is four.

This Bayesian network is a model for barley production, featuring various factors that influence the growth and quality of barley. The network is a complex system with many interactions between variables, making it a challenging problem for modeling and analysis.
