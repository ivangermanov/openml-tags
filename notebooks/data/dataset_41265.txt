The Titanic dataset, tagged as OpenML-Reg19, aims to predict the Fare of passengers. The variable descriptions are as follows: Socio-Economic Status is represented by the Pclass variable, which categorizes passengers into Upper, Middle, and Lower classes. The Age variable represents the passenger's age, which may be fractional if the passenger is less than one year old, and may be estimated in the form of a decimal value. The Sibsp variable defines family relationships, including siblings, spouses, and other relatives. The Parch variable also defines family relationships, including parents and children.

The dataset features a range of variables, including Age, Fare, Sex, Sibsp, Parch, Socio-Economic Status, and Embarked.
