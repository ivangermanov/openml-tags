QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values of various compounds on drug target TID. The activity unit is pseudo pCI. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Prostanoid EP receptor, also known as PGE receptor EP subtype, Prostaglandin E receptor EP subtype, and Ptger. This protein is found in Mus musculus and belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor and lipid like ligand receptor subgroups.

The Prostanoid EP receptor is involved in numerous biological processes, including fever generation, inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, and regulation of various physiological functions such as smooth muscle contraction, acid secretion, and circadian rhythms. It is associated with several cellular components, including the plasma membrane, cell surface, and nuclear membrane.

The receptor's functions include G protein coupled receptor activity, prostaglandin receptor activity, and protein binding. It plays roles in multiple signaling cascades, such as adenylate cyclase modulating and activating pathways, phospholipase C activating pathways, and regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

This protein is referenced in various databases including canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. It is involved in prostanoid ligand receptor interactions and G alpha signaling events.
