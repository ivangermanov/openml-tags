Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset contains various features describing flags, including their geographical location, physical characteristics, and symbolic elements. These features include the name of the country, the landmass where the country is located, the time zone, the country's area and population, the predominant language and religion, and the presence of certain design elements on the flag such as bars, stripes, colors, and symbols.
