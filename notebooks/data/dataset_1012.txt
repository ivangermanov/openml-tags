This dataset focuses on flags from various nations, examining their characteristics and design elements. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem. The features encompass a wide range of attributes including geographical information, population statistics, linguistic and religious data, as well as specific details about flag designs such as colors, shapes, and symbols. This binarized version simplifies the classification task, potentially making it more suitable for certain machine learning applications or comparative studies.
