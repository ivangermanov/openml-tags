The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is particularly useful because it generates datasets with varying levels of complexity, allowing researchers to test the performance of their algorithms under different conditions.

The original Friedman function has five features for input, which are related to the output. However, to measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output, and their purpose is to evaluate an algorithm's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information.

Furthermore, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity, which refers to the number of features that depend on other features. This is done to assess an algorithm's robustness to correlated inputs. The generated Friedman datasets have varying parameters, including the number of features, the number of samples, and the colinearity degree.

The number of features varies from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output. The remaining features are randomly generated and do not affect the output. The number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand. The colinearity degree ranges from zero to four, indicating the level of correlation between features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. Each dataset has a target attribute, which is the variable being predicted.
