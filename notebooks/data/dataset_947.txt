The MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset is a collection of simulated data generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, to mimic the registration of high-energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique.

Cherenkov gamma telescopes observe high-energy gamma rays by detecting the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside electromagnetic showers initiated by these gamma rays and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation, which ranges from visible to ultraviolet wavelengths, leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing the reconstruction of the shower parameters.

The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of a few hundred to several thousand Cherenkov photons get collected, forming patterns called shower images. These images enable the statistical discrimination between those caused by primary gammas (signal) and the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).

Typically, the image of a shower after some preprocessing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, meaning the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, resulting in a correlation axis that defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse, often referred to as Hillas parameters, are among the image parameters used for discrimination.

Additionally, the energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be employed in discrimination. Furthermore, there are other discriminating characteristics, such as the extent of the cluster in the image plane or the total sum of depositions.
