Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: group, concentration, age, at risk, binary class

This dataset focuses on the relationship between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer in males. It has been processed to create a binary classification problem, where instances are categorized as either positive or negative based on their target values relative to the mean. The original numeric data has been transformed to facilitate easier analysis and classification tasks. The dataset includes information on various factors such as group assignment, arsenic concentration, age of subjects, risk assessment, and the binary classification outcome. This resource is valuable for researchers studying environmental health impacts, cancer epidemiology, and data science applications in medical research.
