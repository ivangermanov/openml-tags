**Data Description**

This dataset comprises historical price data of the New Zealand Dollar versus United States Dollar (NZD/USD) currency pair, obtained from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a single hourly candlestick, with the entire dataset spanning from January to December. Since the Forex market is closed on weekends, there are no entries for Saturdays and Sundays. All timestamps are recorded in the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is determined by comparing the mean close price of the subsequent hour to the mean close price of the current hour. A true classification indicates an upward trend in the mean close price over the next hourly period, while a false classification denotes a downward or stagnant trend.
