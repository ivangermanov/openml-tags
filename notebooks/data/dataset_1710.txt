QSAR-TID-100993 Dataset 

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred ninety nine three. The dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four one, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four two,...
