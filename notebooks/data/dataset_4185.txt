Iris Reproduced 

This is perhaps the most well-known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. It is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains three classes, each referring to a type of iris plant, with fifty instances per class. One class is linearly separable from the other two, whereas the latter are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain.

The instances in this dataset represent individual plants. 

Attribute Information:

The dataset includes five attributes: sepal length in centimeters, sepal width in centimeters, petal length in centimeters, petal width in centimeters, and class, which refers to the type of iris plant, namely Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, or Iris Virginica.

This dataset is one of the earliest used in the literature on classification methods and is widely used in statistics and machine learning. It is a simple yet effective domain for predicting the class of iris plant based on its physical characteristics.
