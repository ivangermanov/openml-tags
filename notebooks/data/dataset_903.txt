Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one through oz twenty five, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean, respectively.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies, including those related to mythbusting and various numbered research initiatives. It is designed to be used in regression analysis and binary classification tasks, potentially for comparing different modeling approaches or testing hypotheses about data transformation effects on predictive performance.

The features of the dataset are labeled as "oz" followed by numbers, suggesting they may represent measurements or observations of some kind. The final feature, "binary Class," is the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.
