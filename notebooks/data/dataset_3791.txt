MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-10564 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10564. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including identifiers and a class feature, namely MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The prostanoid FP receptor, also known as the prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor, PGF receptor, or prostanoid FP receptor, is a single protein and the preferred name for this target. It is a membrane receptor and belongs to family A G protein-coupled receptors, specifically small molecule receptors and lipid-like ligand receptors. 

This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory responses, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentrations. Furthermore, it is located in the plasma membrane and membrane.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, prostanoid FP receptor, prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, molecular fingerprints.
