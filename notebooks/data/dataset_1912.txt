This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Three. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Three.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and multiple fingerprints. The fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to government, health, and QSAR studies. It is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The target is Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Three, which is a single protein and preferred name. It also has synonyms such as Gprc one c, Grm three, and mGluR three. 

It is classified under one membrane receptor family C G protein-coupled receptor small molecule receptor neurotransmitter receptor. 

The dataset also includes information about the target, such as its description, relationship, accession, and species group. It also includes information about the target's classification, expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, and other related information.
