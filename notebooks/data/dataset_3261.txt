QSAR-TID-101533 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin II Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin II Receptor. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Type One Angiotensin II Receptor is a single protein, also known as Type-1 Angiotensin II Receptor, and is classified as a G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including kidney development, maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis by renin-angiotensin, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The receptor is also involved in various cellular components, including plasma membrane and membrane. It has various molecular functions, including angiotensin type I receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, angiotensin type II receptor activity, bradykinin receptor binding, and protein heterodimerization activity.
