This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin Two Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin Two Receptor.

The Type One Angiotensin Two Receptor is a single protein and its preferred name is Type-One Angiotensin Two Receptor. It has synonyms but they are not specified. The organism is Sus Scrofa and its species group is not applicable. The protein target classification description is Type-One Angiotensin Two Receptor.

It is associated with multiple Gene Ontology components including plasma membrane and membrane. It is also associated with multiple Gene Ontology functions including angiotensin type one receptor activity, G-protein coupled receptor activity, angiotensin type two receptor activity, bradykinin receptor binding, and protein heterodimerization activity.

Additionally, it is associated with multiple Gene Ontology processes including kidney development, maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis by renin-angiotensin, inflammatory response, signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, Rho protein signal transduction, and many others.
