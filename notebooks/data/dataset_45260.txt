Pigs Bayesian Network. Sample Eight.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a substantial number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, indicating that each node has a limited number of parents and children. The average degree is also relatively low, suggesting that the network is not densely connected. However, there are some nodes with a high in-degree, indicating that they have many parents.

The network features a wide range of variables, including those related to astronomy and image analysis.
