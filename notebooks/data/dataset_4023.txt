Diabetes Dataset

Ten baseline variables, including age, gender, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, were obtained for each patient, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

The dataset consists of a large number of instances and attributes. The first ten columns contain numerical predictive values, while the eleventh column represents the target variable, which measures disease progression one year after baseline.

**Attribute Information:**

The dataset contains several attributes, including:

* Age, measured in years
* Gender
* Body Mass Index
* Average Blood Pressure
* Total Serum Cholesterol
* Low-Density Lipoproteins
* High-Density Lipoproteins
* Total Cholesterol divided by High-Density Lipoprotein
* Possibly Log of Serum Triglycerides Level
* Blood Sugar Level

Note that each of these ten feature variables has been mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the number of samples, resulting in a sum of squares of each column totaling one.

**Source:**
The dataset was obtained from a reliable source, specifically designed for statistical analysis and machine learning purposes.
