**Tags:** MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30027. It has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Folded Circular Fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
