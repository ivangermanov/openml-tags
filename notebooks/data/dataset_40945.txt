Titanic 
Tags: Computational Universe, Manufacturing, Text Data 

The original Titanic dataset describes the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. This dataset does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers. The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. 

The datasets used here were begun by various researchers, one of the original sources being Triumph and Tragedy, which includes a passenger list created by many researchers and edited by several individuals. The Titanic data frame has been greatly updated and improved using the Encyclopedia Titanica, and this dataset has been constructed. Some duplicate passengers have been dropped, many errors corrected, many missing ages filled in, and new variables created. 

For more information about how this dataset was constructed, please refer to the relevant resources. 

Attribute Information 
The variables on our extracted dataset are Passenger Class, Survived, Name, Age, Embarked, Home Destination, Room, Ticket, Boat, and Sex. Passenger Class refers to the socioeconomic class of the passenger, with First Class being the highest and Third Class being the lowest. Age is in years, and some infants had fractional values. 

These data are useful for demonstrating many of the functions in Hmisc as well as demonstrating binary logistic regression analysis using the Design library. They provide valuable insights into the tragic event that occurred on the ill-fated voyage of the Titanic.
