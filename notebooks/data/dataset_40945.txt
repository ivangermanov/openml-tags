Titanic Tags: text data

The original Titanic dataset describes the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. This dataset does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers. The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun by a variety of researchers, and one of the original sources is a passenger list created by many researchers and edited by a team of experts.

Thomas Cason has greatly updated and improved the Titanic data frame using the Encyclopedia Titanica and created the dataset here. Some duplicate passengers have been dropped, many errors corrected, many missing ages filled in, and new variables created. For more information about how this dataset was constructed, please refer to the provided link.

The variables on our extracted dataset are passenger class, survival status, name, age, port of embarkation, home destination, room, ticket, lifeboat, and sex. Passenger class refers to the socio-economic class of the passenger, with first class being the highest and third class being the lowest. Age is in years, and some infants had fractional values.

The Titanic dataset has no missing data and includes records for the crew, but age is categorized as adult or child. These data were obtained from a reliable source and are useful for demonstrating many of the functions in Hmisc as well as demonstrating binary logistic regression analysis using the Design library.

The dataset is useful for statistical analysis and education, and has been used in various studies and publications. It provides a unique insight into the tragic event of the Titanic's sinking and can be used to explore various themes and relationships.
