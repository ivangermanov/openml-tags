**Meta-Album DIBaS Dataset (Extended)**

The Digital Images of Bacteria Species dataset (DIBaS) is a dataset of thirty-three bacterial species with around twenty images for each species. For the Meta-Album, since the images were large with very few samples in each class, we decided to split each image into several smaller images before resizing them to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight. We then obtained a preprocessed dataset of images with at least one hundred eight images for each class. This dataset was also preprocessed with blob normalization techniques, which is quite unusual for this type of image. The goal of this transformation was to reduce the importance of color in decision-making for a bias-aware challenge.
