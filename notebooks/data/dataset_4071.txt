Brazilian Houses

Tags: Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the Regression on Numerical Features benchmark.

This dataset contains houses to rent with thirteen different features. Please note that some values in the dataset can be considered outliers for further analysis. It is also important to bear in mind that the web crawler was used only to gather the data, so it is possible that errors in the original data exist.

Between versions of the dataset, there may be differences due to the web crawler being run on different days, resulting in added or deleted houses, as well as added cities.

The dataset corresponds to the second version of the original dataset. In the attribute floor, the value "-" was replaced by "0", as it refers to houses with just one floor.

Features include area, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, parking spaces, homeowners association fees, rent amount, property tax, fire insurance, and total cost in Brazilian Real.
