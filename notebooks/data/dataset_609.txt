Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate colinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

The Friedman function is widely used for data generation and includes both linear and non-linear relations between input and output. A normalized noise is added to the output. The function is as follows:

y = ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus zero point five squared plus ten multiplied by X four plus five multiplied by X five plus e

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in the number of features, number of samples, and colinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. For datasets with higher colinearity degrees, a larger number of features are generated.

As a result, numerous artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target.
