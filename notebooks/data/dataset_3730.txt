QSAR-TID-11408 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11408. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains a wide range of compounds with varying levels of activity against the drug target TID: 11408. The activity values are expressed in terms of pseudo-pCI50, which is a measure of the potency of a compound. The dataset also includes features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, which is a unique identifier for each compound, and MEDIAN_PXC50, which is a measure of the median activity of each compound.

The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor that is used to characterize the chemical structure of a compound. They are generated from SMILES strings, which are a notation system used to represent the structure of a molecule. The fingerprints are obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, which is a software tool used for cheminformatics and bioinformatics.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for the drug target TID: 11408, which can be used to develop predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.
