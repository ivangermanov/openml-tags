QSAR-TID-10143 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10143. The dataset has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10143. The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The dataset is related to the Neuropeptide Y receptor type four, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in the peptide receptor family. The receptor is responsible for the pancreatic polypeptide receptor activity and is involved in the signal transduction pathway.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including the development of new drugs targeting the Neuropeptide Y receptor type four. It can also be used for the prediction of activity values of compounds on this drug target.
