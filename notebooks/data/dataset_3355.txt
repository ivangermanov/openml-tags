This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand forty-three, and it has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and many others that are not human-readable molecular fingerprints.

QSAR-TID-one thousand forty-three dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset is related to health and medicine, specifically to QSAR studies and molecular targets. It contains information about the molecular structure and properties of different compounds and their activities on specific targets.

The dataset is categorized under the tags health, medicine, MTLQSAR, and study three.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular targets, health, medicine, MetaQSAR, molecular structure, properties of compounds.
