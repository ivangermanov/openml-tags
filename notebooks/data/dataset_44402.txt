Tags: Subsampling of the Bank Marketing dataset with seed equals zero arguments dot nrows equals two thousand arguments dot ncols equals one hundred arguments dot nclasses equals ten arguments dot no stratify equals false 

Generated with the following source code:

def subsample(self, seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, stratified) -> Dataset:
random number generator equals numpy dot random dot default random generator opened parenthesis seed closed parenthesis 
x equals self dot x 
y equals self dot y 

Uniformly sample classes equals y dot unique 
if length of classes is greater than nclasses max then 
value counts equals y dot value counts 
selected classes equals random number generator dot choice opened parenthesis classes comma size equals nclasses max comma replace equals false comma probability equals value counts divided by sum of value counts closed parenthesis 
Select the indices where one of these classes is present 
idxs equals y dot index opened parenthesis y dot isin opened parenthesis classes closed parenthesis closed parenthesis 
x equals x dot iloc opened parenthesis idxs closed parenthesis 
y equals y dot iloc opened parenthesis idxs closed parenthesis 

Uniformly sample columns if required 
if length of x dot columns is greater than ncols max then 
columns indexes equals random number generator dot choice opened parenthesis list of range of length of x dot columns closed parenthesis comma size equals ncols max comma replace equals false closed parenthesis 
sorted column indexes equals sorted opened parenthesis columns indexes closed parenthesis 
selected columns equals list of x dot columns opened parenthesis sorted column indexes closed parenthesis 
x equals x opened parenthesis selected columns closed parenthesis 
else 
sorted column indexes equals list of range of length of x dot columns 
if length of x is greater than nrows max then 
Stratify accordingly 
target name equals y dot name 
data equals pandas dot concat opened parenthesis x comma y comma axis equals quote columns quote closed parenthesis 
underscore comma subset equals sklearn model selection dot train test split opened parenthesis data comma test size equals nrows max comma stratify equals data opened parenthesis target name closed parenthesis comma shuffle equals true comma random state equals seed closed parenthesis 
x equals subset dot drop opened parenthesis target name comma axis equals quote columns quote closed parenthesis 
y equals subset opened parenthesis target name closed parenthesis 

We need to convert categorical columns to string for OpenML 
categorical mask equals list of self dot categorical mask opened parenthesis i closed parenthesis for i in sorted column indexes 
columns equals list of x dot columns 
return Dataset opened parenthesis 
Technically this is not the same but it's where it was derived from 
dataset equals self dot dataset 
x equals x 
y equals y 
categorical mask equals categorical mask 
columns equals columns 
closed parenthesis
