QSAR-TID-10495 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10495. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1829 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

Cathepsin K is a single protein, also known as Cathepsin O, Cathepsin O2, Cathepsin X, and CTSK. It is an enzyme, a protease, and a cysteine protease, belonging to the cysteine protease CA clan and the cysteine protease C1A family.

Cathepsin K is involved in various biological processes, including autophagy of mitochondrion, intramembranous ossification, proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, apoptotic process, immune response, and response to organic cyclic compound.

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including extracellular region, extracellular space, nucleoplasm, lysosome, plasma membrane, and apical plasma membrane.

Cathepsin K has various molecular functions, including fibronectin binding, cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, collagen binding, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.
