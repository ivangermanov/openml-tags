Predict Whether Annual Income Exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars Based on Census Data 

This dataset, also known as the Census Income Dataset, aims to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds fifty thousand dollars using various demographic and socioeconomic factors obtained from census data. The training and testing datasets have been combined into one comprehensive dataset.

Upon examining the dataset, null values represented by question marks were replaced with NA to ensure consistency. Furthermore, fifty-two duplicate entries were identified and removed to prevent data duplication.

The dataset comprises several features, including Age, Work Class, Education Level, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship, Race, Sex, Capital Gains, Capital Losses, Hours Worked per Week, and Native Country. These features provide valuable insights into an individual's background and lifestyle, which can be used to predict their annual income.
