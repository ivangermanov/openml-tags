QSAR-TID-101033 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101033. The dataset has seventy-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Rhodopsin Kinase, also known as G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase One. Rhodopsin Kinase is a single protein, and it is a synonym for GRK One Rhodopsin Kinase GRK One RHOK. The organism is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group. The protein target classification is one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase GRK family/AGC protein kinase GRK subfamily.

The dataset is related to the MetaQSAR project, which is a comprehensive dataset of QSAR models and QSAR data. The project aims to provide a large collection of QSAR models and data, which can be used for various applications, including drug discovery and development.

The dataset is also related to the ChEMBL database, which is a large database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. The database contains information on the biological activity of small molecules, and it is widely used in drug discovery and development.
