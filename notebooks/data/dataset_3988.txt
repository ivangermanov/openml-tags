QSAR-TID-101033 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101033. It has seventy-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset was scraped from various sources including ChEMBL, providing information on the target protein, Rhodopsin Kinase, also known as G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase One, GRK One, or Rhodopsin Kinase GRK One. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, AGC protein kinase group, AGC protein kinase GRK family, and AGC protein kinase GRK subfamily.

According to Gene Ontology, this protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, visual perception, regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, regulation of signal transduction, rhodopsin mediated signaling pathway, phosphorylation, regulation of rhodopsin mediated signaling pathway, protein autophosphorylation, and response to stimulus.

It is also associated with various cellular components, including photoreceptor outer segment, cytoplasm, membrane, cell projection, and photoreceptor disc membrane.
