QSAR-TID-17075 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17075, and it has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four zero, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four one, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four two, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four three, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four four, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four five, and many more.
