**Meta-Album Textures Dataset (Extended)**

The original Textures dataset is a combination of four texture datasets: KTH-TIPS and KTH-TIPS two, Kylberg Textures Dataset, and UIUC Textures Dataset. The data in all four datasets is collected in laboratory conditions, meaning images were captured in a controlled environment with configurable brightness, luminosity, scale, and angle.
