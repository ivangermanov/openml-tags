QSAR-TID-108 Tags: Government, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 108. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset provides information about the Serotonin 2c receptor, also known as 5-HT2c receptor, which is a single protein found in humans. It belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors and is involved in various physiological processes, including behavioral fear response, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, and signal transduction.

The receptor is activated by serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep. The activation of the receptor leads to a signaling cascade that involves the activation of phospholipase C, which ultimately results in the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores.

The dataset includes information about the ligands that bind to the receptor, including their mechanism of action, maximum phase, and first approval. Some of the ligands included in the dataset are nefazodone, olanzapine, methysergide, loxapine, and trimipramine.

The receptor is also associated with various biological processes, including behavioral fear response, feeding behavior, and regulation of nervous system process. It is also involved in the regulation of appetite and corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion.
