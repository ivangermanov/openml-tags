Banks play a crucial role in market economies as they decide who can get finance and on what terms, thereby having the power to make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function smoothly, individuals and companies need access to credit. Credit scoring algorithms, which predict the probability of default, are the methods banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted.

This competition requires participants to improve upon the current state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that someone will experience financial distress in the next two years. The ultimate goal of this competition is to build a model that borrowers can utilize to make informed financial decisions.
