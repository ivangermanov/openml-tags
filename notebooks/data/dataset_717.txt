Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Total Mortality, Respiratory Mortality, Cardiovascular Mortality, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Hydrocarbons, Ozone, Binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem focused on various mortality rates and environmental factors. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification, where instances below the mean are labeled as positive and those above as negative. This conversion allows for a simplified analysis of the relationship between environmental conditions and mortality rates. The dataset includes features related to different types of mortality, weather conditions, and air pollutants, making it suitable for studies on the impact of environmental factors on public health.
