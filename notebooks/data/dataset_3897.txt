QSAR-TID-10360 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10360. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10360. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the Histamine H4 receptor, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is also known as H4R, HH4R, Histamine H4 receptor, and Hrh4. The receptor is found in the Rattus norvegicus species and is classified as a Family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The Histamine H4 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration and chemical synaptic transmission.

The dataset provides information on the GO components, functions, and processes of the Histamine H4 receptor. The GO components include plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, and synapse. The GO functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, histamine receptor activity, and G protein-coupled serotonin receptor activity. The GO processes include inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset also provides information on the canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam IDs of the Histamine H4 receptor.
