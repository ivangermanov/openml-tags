San Francisco International Airport Report on Monthly Passenger Traffic Statistics by Airline

Airport data is seasonal in nature, and therefore any comparative analyses should be done on a period-over-period basis, such as comparing January of one year to January of another year, rather than comparing January to February of the same year. It is also important to note that fact and attribute field relationships are not always one-to-one. For example, Passenger Counts belonging to United Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are additive, which provides flexibility for the user to derive categorical Passenger Counts as desired.

The report features the following information: Activity Period, Operating Airline, Operating Airline International Air Transport Association Code, Published Airline, Published Airline International Air Transport Association Code, Geographic Summary, Geographic Region, Activity Type Code, Price Category Code, Terminal, Boarding Area, Passenger Count, Adjusted Activity Type Code, Adjusted Passenger Count, Year, and Month.
