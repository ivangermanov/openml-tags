San Francisco International Airport Report on Monthly Passenger Traffic Statistics by Airline

Airport data exhibits a seasonal pattern; therefore, any comparative analyses should be conducted on a period-over-period basis, such as comparing January of one year to January of another year, rather than comparing consecutive months, like January to February. It is essential to acknowledge that the relationships between fact and attribute fields are not always one-to-one. For instance, passenger counts affiliated with United Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are cumulative, providing users with the flexibility to derive categorical passenger counts according to their preferences.

The report includes various features, including activity period, operating airline, published airline, geographic summary, geographic region, activity type code, price category code, terminal, boarding area, passenger count, adjusted activity type code, adjusted passenger count, year, and month.

Keywords: airport data, passenger traffic statistics, airline, seasonal pattern, period-over-period analysis, cumulative data, categorical analysis.
