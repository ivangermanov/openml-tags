QSAR TID Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID:. The dataset has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Adenosine A receptor, also known as ADORA. This is a single protein target classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein coupled receptor category, specifically a small molecule receptor in the nucleotide like receptor subfamily. The preferred name is Adenosine A receptor, with synonyms including Adenosine receptor A ADORA. The organism is Homo sapiens.

The Adenosine A receptor is involved in various biological processes, including G protein coupled adenosine receptor signaling pathways, inflammatory responses, signal transduction, regulation of heart contraction, and modulation of cell population proliferation. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane, dendrites, and synapses.

Several compounds targeting the Adenosine A receptor are in various stages of drug development. These include Piclidenoson and Namodenoson, both small molecule Adenosine A receptor agonists in Phase, and QAF, a small molecule Adenosine A receptor antagonist in Phase.

The receptor is associated with multiple gene ontology terms related to its cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. It is also referenced in various databases and resources such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY.
