GISette is a handwritten digit recognition problem, where the challenge is to separate the highly confusable digits Four and Nine. This dataset is one of five datasets of the NIPS feature selection challenge. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of dimension twenty-eight by twenty-eight. The original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge. In particular, pixels were sampled at random in the middle top part of the feature containing the information necessary to disambiguate Four from Nine, and higher order features were created as products of these pixels to plunge the problem in a higher dimensional feature space. We also added a number of distractor features called probes having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.

Preprocessing: The data set is also available at UCI. Because the labels of testing set are not available, here we use the validation set as the testing set. The training data are feature-wisely scaled to a range of minus one to one. Then the testing data are scaled based on the same scaling factors for the training data.

Difference with version one: the target feature is now binary, as it should be.
