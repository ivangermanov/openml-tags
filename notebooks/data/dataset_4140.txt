This dataset, known as Higgs, falls under the categories of Computer Systems and Mathematics. It is a part of the regression on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in a specific way.

The dataset originates from the University of California Irvine and is available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is a smaller version of the original dataset, containing one million rows.

This dataset is related to Higgs Boson detection data, which was produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by particle detectors in an accelerator. These features include properties such as lepton momentum, lepton direction, missing energy magnitude, and jet properties. The last seven features are high-level features derived by physicists to help distinguish between two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to eliminate the need for physicists to manually develop such features.

The dataset contains a total of twenty-eight features. The first feature is the class label, where one represents signal and zero represents background. The remaining features are divided into two categories: low-level features and high-level features. Low-level features include kinematic properties, while high-level features are derived by physicists.

For more detailed information about each feature, please refer to the original paper. The last five hundred thousand examples are used as a test set.
