Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Road Safety with seed equals zero

This dataset is a subsample of the original Road Safety dataset, generated using a specific source code. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The subsampling process started by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded a certain maximum, the classes were sampled uniformly based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to filter the data.

Next, the columns were sampled uniformly if the number of columns exceeded a certain maximum. The selected columns were then used to filter the data.

Finally, the rows were sampled using stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution was maintained. The resulting dataset was then converted into a format suitable for further analysis.

The features of this dataset include Vehicle Reference, Vehicle Type, Vehicle Manoeuvre, Vehicle Location, Hit Object, Age of Driver, Age Band of Driver, Engine Capacity, Propulsion Code, Age of Vehicle, Location, Police Force, Number of Vehicles, Number of Casualties, Local Authority, Road Number, Urban or Rural Area, Vehicle Reference, Casualty Reference, Sex of Casualty, Age of Casualty, Age Band of Casualty, Pedestrian Location, Pedestrian Movement, Casualty Type, and Casualty IMD Decile.
