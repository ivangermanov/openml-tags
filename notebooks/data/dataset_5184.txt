The Weather dataset is a tiny collection of data that we will use repeatedly to illustrate various machine learning methods. This entirely fictional dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game. 

In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. In this particular case, there are four attributes that describe each instance: the overall outlook, the temperature, the level of humidity, and whether it is windy. 

The outcome or target variable is whether to play the game or not.
