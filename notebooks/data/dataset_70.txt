This dataset, known as BNG (anneal, nominal), is tagged as artificial and BNG. It encompasses a wide range of features related to steel and its properties. These features include various aspects of steel composition, manufacturing processes, and physical characteristics. The dataset covers elements such as carbon content, hardness, and strength, as well as manufacturing considerations like temper rolling and surface finish. It also includes measurements of thickness, width, and length, along with other properties such as enamelability and formability. The dataset appears to be comprehensive in its coverage of steel-related attributes, potentially useful for analysis or modeling in metallurgy or materials science.
