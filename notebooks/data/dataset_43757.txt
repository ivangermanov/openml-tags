Breast Cancer Wisconsin Prognostic Data Set

Tags: Context Data From UCI Machine Learning Repository

This dataset contains follow-up data for one breast cancer case, featuring consecutive patients seen by a doctor since 1984. The cases include only those exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. The first thirty features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass, describing characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found online.

The separation described above was obtained using Multisurface Method Tree, a classification method that uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of one to four features and one to three separating planes. The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the three-dimensional space is described in a research paper.

The Recurrence Surface Approximation method is a linear programming model that predicts Time to Recur using both recurrent and non-recurrent cases. This database is also available through the University of Wisconsin CS FTP server.

The dataset includes the following features: identification number, outcome, time, radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

This dataset is a valuable resource for machine learning practitioners interested in applying their algorithms to real-life science data.
