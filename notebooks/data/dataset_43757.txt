Content 

Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. These are consecutive patients seen by doctors since nineteen eighty-four, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. The first thirty features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/street/images/. 

The separation described above was obtained using Multisurface Method Tree, a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of one to four features and one to three separating planes. The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the three-dimensional space is that described in Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets. 

The Recurrence Surface Approximation method is a linear programming model which predicts Time To Recur using both recurrent and non-recurrent cases.
