Name: sf-police-incidents Seed Two N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset sf-police-incidents with seed equals two, arguments n rows equals two thousand, arguments n columns equals one hundred, arguments n classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

First, it sets up a random number generator with the given seed. Then, it gets the features and target from the dataset. It uniformly samples the classes, selecting the indices where one of these classes is present. If the number of features is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of samples is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled features, target, categorical mask, and columns.
