The QSAR-TID-12476 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12476. This dataset has 1023 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

Features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It is related to the metabotropic glutamate receptor five, also known as GRM five or MGluR five, which is a single protein. The preferred name for this target is Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Five.

This receptor is part of the protein family classified as one membrane receptor, Family C G Protein Coupled Receptor, Small Molecule Receptor, Neurotransmitter Receptor, and is found in the species group Rattus Norvegicus.

The description for this target includes its relationship to other proteins, such as being a subset of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Protein Family. It also includes its accession number, which is P three one four two four.
