**QSAR-TID-11766**
**Tags:** Government, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11766. It has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values in unit pseudo-pCI fifty of several compounds on drug target TID: 11766.

The features in this dataset include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. The molecular fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to endothelin-converting enzyme one, a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. It is involved in response to hypoxia, positive regulation of receptor recycling, proteolysis, and many other processes.
