QSAR-TID-101182 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101182. The dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Zero, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit One, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Two, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Three, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Four, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Five, and so on.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101182. The data is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive dataset for QSAR modeling.
