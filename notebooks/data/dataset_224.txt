Breast Cancer Dataset

Tags: Machine Learning, Medicine

This dataset is part of the breast cancer domain obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.

Title: Breast Cancer Data

The dataset contains nine attributes, some of which are linear and others are nominal, describing two hundred eighty-six instances of breast cancer tumors. These instances belong to two classes: no-recurrence-events and recurrence-events.

Past usage of this dataset includes various studies, such as numeric prediction using instance-based learning with encoding length selection, and testing application to three medical domains. The accuracy range of these studies falls between sixty-six percent and seventy-eight percent.

Relevant information about this dataset includes its repeated appearance in machine learning literature, along with two other datasets from the same institute: lymphography and primary-tumor.

The nine attributes describing each instance are:

* Age, categorized into nine groups ranging from ten to ninety-nine years old.
* Menopause status, categorized into three groups: less than forty, greater than or equal to forty, and premenopausal.
* Tumor size, categorized into twelve groups ranging from zero to fifty-four units.
* Number of invaded nodes, categorized into thirteen groups ranging from zero to thirty-nine units.
* Node caps status, either yes or no.
* Degree of malignancy, categorized into three groups.
* Breast affected, either left or right.
* Quadrant of the breast affected, categorized into five groups.
* Irradiation status, either yes or no.

There are eight instances with missing values for node caps and one instance with a missing value for breast quadrant.

The class distribution is skewed, with two hundred one instances belonging to the no-recurrence-events class and eighty-five instances belonging to the recurrence-events class.
