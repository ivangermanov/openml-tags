Pasture

Tags: Agriculture, Earth Science, Study One, Study Forty-One

The objective of this dataset is to predict pasture production from a variety of biophysical factors. Vegetation and soil variables from areas of grazed North Island hill country with different management histories, including fertilizer application and stocking rates, between 1973 and 1994 were measured and subdivided into thirty-six paddocks.

Nineteen vegetation, soil chemical, physical, and biological, and soil water variables were selected as potentially useful biophysical indicators.

Attribute information includes:

* Fertilizer used, which is an enumeration
* Slope of the paddock, which is an integer value
* Aspect deviation from northwest, which is also an integer value
* Olsen Phosphorus, which is an integer value
* Minimum Nitrogen, which is an integer value
* Total Soil, which is an integer value
* Calcium Magnesium ratio, which is a real value
* Soil Lom, which is a real value representing grams per one hundred grams
* Mean Nitrogen Fixation, which is a real value
* Main three species of earthworms per gram per meter squared, which is a real value
* Number of earthworm species, which is an integer value
* Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, which is a real value in millimeters per hour
* Organic Matter, which is a real value
* Air permeability, which is a real value
* Porosity, which is a real value
* Mean percentage of highly fertile ragwort growth, which is a real value
* Legume yield, which is a real value representing kilograms of dry matter per hectare
* Mean percentage of other species presence, which is a real value
* Mean temperature during January to March, which is a real value
* Annual mean runoff, which is a real value in millimeters
* Root surface area, which is a real value representing meters squared per meter cubed
* Leaf phosphorus, which is a real value representing parts per million
* Pasture production classification, which is an enumeration
