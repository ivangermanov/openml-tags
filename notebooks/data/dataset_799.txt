This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('Positive') and all others as negative ('Negative'). This dataset features several variables related to chemistry and life science studies. The goal is to analyze these variables to gain insights into their relationships and patterns.
