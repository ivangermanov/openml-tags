Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset includes several features, including oz one through oz five, as well as a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a modified version of an existing dataset, specifically designed for binary classification tasks. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the original numeric target variable and using this value as a threshold to categorize instances into two distinct classes. This binarization approach allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem, potentially offering new insights or analytical approaches to the data.

The dataset's purpose appears to be related to mythbusting and various studies, as indicated by its tags. While the original source and date of creation are unknown, this binarized version serves as a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in exploring binary classification problems or comparing results between regression and classification approaches on the same underlying data.
