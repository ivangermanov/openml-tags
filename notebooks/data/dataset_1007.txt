The Bridges dataset has been binarized from its original form. In this revised version, the multi-class target feature has been transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

This dataset is relevant to the fields of Chemistry, Life Science, and MythBusting. It contains various features describing bridges, including their Identification, River location, Physical Location, Year Erected, Purpose, Length, Number of Lanes, Clearance Below Grade, Type or Design, Material Used, Span, and Relative Location.
