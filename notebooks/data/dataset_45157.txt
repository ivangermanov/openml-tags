Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample Four.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network consists of thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, and the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium model.

Please cite the original paper, which discusses the MIDAS - An Influence Diagram for Management of Mildew in Winter Wheat.

The network features variables related to mildew management, including microclimate, leaf area index, fungal diseases, and weather conditions.

Keywords: Bayesian network, mildew management, winter wheat, influence diagram, microclimate, leaf area index, fungal diseases, weather conditions.
