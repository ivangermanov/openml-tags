Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample Four.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this network, which is a discrete medium-sized network.

This network contains thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, while the average degree is around two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network is cited in the proceedings of the Twelfth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the paper titled MIDAS - An Influence Diagram for Management of Mildew in Winter Wheat.

Some notable features of this network include Micro, Leaf Area Index, Photo, Mould, Radiation, Yield, and Temperature.
