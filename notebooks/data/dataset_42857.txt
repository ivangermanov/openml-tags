Pendigits Dataset Information

The Pendigits dataset is a collection of handwritten digit samples from forty-four writers. The dataset is divided into two parts: the training set, which consists of samples from thirty writers, and the testing set, which consists of samples from fourteen writers. The training set is used for training, cross-validation, and writer-dependent testing, while the testing set is used for writer-independent testing.

The dataset was created using a Wacom PL-100V pressure-sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The tablet sends x and y coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals. The writers were asked to write two hundred and fifty digits in random order inside boxes of five hundred by five hundred tablet pixel resolution. The subjects were monitored only during the first entry screens, and each screen contained five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above.

The raw data captured from the tablet consists of integer values between zero and five hundred. To make the representation invariant to translations and scale distortions, normalization was applied to the data. The new coordinates are such that the coordinate with the maximum range varies between zero and one hundred. Usually, the x coordinate stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.

To train and test the classifiers, the digits need to be represented as constant-length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the points. Temporal resampling or spatial resampling can be used. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time, but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points.

The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of points, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time. The input vector size is two times the number of points resampled. Spatial resampling to eight, twelve, or sixteen points was considered, and it was found that eight points gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity.
