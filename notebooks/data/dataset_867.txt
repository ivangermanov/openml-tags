This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset consists of three features: Livestock Type, Country, and Binary Class.
