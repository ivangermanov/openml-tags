Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Livestock type, Country, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on visualizing livestock across different countries. It aims to challenge common myths and misconceptions about livestock production and distribution. The data has been processed to create a binary classification, simplifying the original numeric values into positive and negative categories based on the mean. This binarization allows for easier analysis and comparison of livestock-related factors between countries. Researchers and analysts can use this dataset to study patterns in livestock types, geographical distribution, and other relevant characteristics. The simplified binary classification may be particularly useful for machine learning applications or quick statistical analyses.
