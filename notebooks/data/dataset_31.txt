German Credit Dataset

This dataset classifies individuals based on a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. The dataset includes a cost matrix:

Good Bad (predicted)
Good  0   1
Bad   5   0

Additional Information:

Two datasets are provided: the original dataset containing categorical/symbolic attributes in "german.data", and a numeric version produced by Strathclyde University in "german.data-numeric". The numeric version has been edited with indicator variables added to accommodate algorithms that cannot handle categorical variables. Ordered categorical attributes have been coded as integers.

This dataset requires the use of a cost matrix as specified earlier.

The dataset does not contain missing values.
