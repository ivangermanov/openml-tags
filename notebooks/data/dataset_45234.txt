**Link Bayesian Network. Sample Four.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete very large dataset.

This dataset has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, while the average degree is moderate. The maximum in-degree is also moderate.

The dataset is characterized by a complex structure, with many nodes and arcs. The number of parameters is substantial, indicating a high degree of complexity.

The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, suggesting that the nodes are not highly interconnected. However, the average degree is moderate, indicating that the nodes have a moderate number of connections.

The maximum in-degree is also moderate, suggesting that there are no nodes with an extremely high number of incoming connections.
