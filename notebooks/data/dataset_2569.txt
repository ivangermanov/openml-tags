The Solar Flare dataset is a multivariate regression data set that consists of two versions, each corresponding to a different year. One version, known as SF One, contains data from nineteen sixty nine, while the other version, referred to as SF Two, contains data from nineteen seventy eight.

This dataset has three target variables that correspond to the number of times three types of solar flare - common, moderate, and severe - are observed within a twenty four hour period. 

Features of the dataset include measures related to sunspot characteristics, such as size and distribution, as well as indicators of overall solar activity and its evolution over time.
