This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Two. The data was obtained from ChEMBL version Seventeen and has Sixty-Six rows and One Thousand Twenty-Six features, including IDs and class feature MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50.

The features represent FCFP Six Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September Two Thousand Fifteen.

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Two is a single protein, also known as ACE Two, ACEH, ACE related carboxypeptidase, and other synonyms. It is an enzyme/protease/metalloprotease/metalloprotease M AE clan/metalloprotease M Two family.

Expression Atlas shows one entry for this protein, while Component Ontology lists Fifteen entries, including extracellular region, extracellular space, cytoplasm, and others. Function Ontology lists Twelve entries, including virus receptor activity, endopeptidase activity, carboxypeptidase activity, and others. Process Ontology lists Twenty-Seven entries, including regulation of cytokine production, angiotensin maturation, and others.

Keywords: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Two, QSAR, MetaQSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings.
