Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset, known as Sleuth Case, is associated with mythbusting and study tags. It is a modified version of an original dataset, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a binary classification. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean value and then categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset includes various features related to educational and socioeconomic factors, such as state information, SAT scores, number of test takers, income levels, years of data, public education metrics, expenditure data, and the resulting binary classification. The source and date of the original dataset are unknown, but users are requested to cite this binarized version when referencing the data.
