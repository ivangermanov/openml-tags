Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample 3.

The Hepar2 Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network consists of seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, while the average degree is approximately three point five one. The maximum in-degree is six.

The Hepar2 Bayesian network is characterized by various features, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, level of consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint problems, platelet count, very high alpha-macroglobulin, spider naevi, spleen problems, age, jaundice, hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, chronic hepatitis, itching, steatosis, sex, history of injections, hepatitis B surface antigen, cirrhosis, palmar erythema, abdominal pain, hepatitis C virus antibody, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase, rheumatoid hepatitis, gallstones, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, primary biliary cirrhosis, alanine transaminase, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, aspartate transaminase, hepatitis B e antigen, skin problems, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, hepatitis B core antibody, right upper quadrant pressure, history of alcohol consumption, lupus erythematosus cells, anti-mitochondrial antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites, hospitalization, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, density, blood transfusion, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, edge, edema, fatty deposits, history of alcoholism, surgical intervention.
