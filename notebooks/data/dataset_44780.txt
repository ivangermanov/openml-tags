KDD Cup Ninety-Nine Seed Two 

This dataset is a subsampling of the KDD Cup Ninety-Nine dataset generated with a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset.

The sampling process first selects a subset of classes from the unique classes present in the dataset. This is done to ensure that the resulting dataset has a limited number of classes. The selection of classes is based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset.

Once the classes have been selected, the dataset is filtered to only include instances that belong to these classes. Next, the columns of the dataset are uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

The rows of the dataset are then stratified according to the class labels to ensure that each class is represented proportionally. Finally, the dataset is split into a training set and a test set using a stratified sampling approach.

The resulting dataset consists of a limited number of instances, classes, and columns, making it more manageable for analysis and modeling purposes.
