This dataset, named QSAR-TID-128, is categorized under the tags Machine Learning, Meteorology, and MTLQSAR. It belongs to the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 128. There are 1386 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The molecular fingerprints are represented as FCFP 1024-bit Molecular Fingerprints, which do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated. 

The dataset is related to the Alpha-1B Adrenergic Receptor, also known as ADRA1B, which is a single protein preferred name. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor/family A G protein-coupled receptor/small molecule receptor (family A GPCR)/monoamine receptor/adrenergic receptor.

The Alpha-1B Adrenergic Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of heart rate by epinephrine-norepinephrine, regulation of muscle contraction, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
