QSAR-TID-128 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 128. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Alpha-1b Adrenergic Receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction and regulation of muscle contraction.

The receptor is also known by other names, including ADRA1B, Alpha-1B Adrenoceptor, and Alpha-1B Adrenoreceptor. It is a target for various compounds, including adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists.

The dataset is part of the ExpressionAtlas and has been annotated with various Gene Ontology terms, including nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and caveola. It is also associated with various biological processes, including positive regulation of heart rate, regulation of muscle contraction, and signal transduction.
