Coronavirus Worldwide Dataset
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics

From the World Health Organization - On a specific day in late December, an alert was sent regarding several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus, which raised concern because when a virus is new, there is limited understanding of its effects on people. Therefore, having daily level information on the affected individuals provides valuable insights when shared with the broader data science community.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes daily statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic, not only for Europe but for the entire world. We rely on the ECDC as they collect and harmonize data from around the globe, allowing for comparisons of what is happening in different countries.

This dataset contains daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths, and recoveries from coronavirus. Additionally, it includes various other parameters, such as average life expectancy, population density, and smoking population, which users may find useful for making further predictions.

The data is available from a specific point in time. The inspiration behind sharing this dataset is to provide people with weekly data, enabling them to make accurate predictions.
