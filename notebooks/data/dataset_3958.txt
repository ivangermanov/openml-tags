QSAR-TID-11806 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11806. The dataset has twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Adenosine A1 receptor, also known as Adora one. Adenosine A1 receptor is a single protein, and its preferred name is Adenosine receptor A one. It is a membrane receptor, and it belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, specifically the small molecule receptor family. It is a nucleotide-like receptor, and it is involved in various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, response to hypoxia, and G protein-coupled adenosine receptor signaling pathway.

The Adenosine A1 receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and kidneys. It plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including blood pressure, heart rate, and neurotransmission. It is also involved in various diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to study the structure-activity relationships of compounds on Adenosine A1 receptor, and to identify potential lead compounds for drug discovery.
