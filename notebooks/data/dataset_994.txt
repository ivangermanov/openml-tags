This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative.

The Vehicle Dataset consists of various features that describe different aspects of vehicles. These features include Compactness, Circularity, Distance Circularity, Radius Ratio, Principal Axis Aspect Ratio, Maximum Length Aspect Ratio, Scatter Ratio, Elongatedness, Principal Axis Rectangularity, Maximum Length Rectangularity, and several other metrics that provide information about the shape and size of vehicles.
