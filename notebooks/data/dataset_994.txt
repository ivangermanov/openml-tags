Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: Compactness, Circularity, Distance Circularity, Radius Ratio, Principal Axis Aspect Ratio, Maximum Length Aspect Ratio, Scatter Ratio, Elongatedness, Principal Axis Rectangularity, Maximum Length Rectangularity, Scaled Variance Major, Scaled Variance Minor, Scaled Radius of Gyration, Skewness About Major, Skewness About Minor, Kurtosis About Major, Kurtosis About Minor, Hollows Ratio, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on vehicle characteristics and has been modified from its original multi-class format to a binary classification problem. The transformation involved recategorizing the majority class as positive and all other classes as negative. This binarized version is intended for use in machine learning and data analysis tasks, particularly those involving binary classification models. The features listed provide various geometric and statistical measures of vehicle shapes and properties, which can be utilized to distinguish between different vehicle types or characteristics.
