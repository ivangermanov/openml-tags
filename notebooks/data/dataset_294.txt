The Satellite Image dataset is classified under Earth Science and Machine Learning. It is a collection of multi-spectral values of pixels in three-by-three neighborhoods in a satellite image, along with the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighborhood.

The primary objective is to predict the classification of a pixel based on its multi-spectral values. The classification of a pixel is represented by a numerical code, which corresponds to specific classes such as red soil, cotton crop, grey soil, damp grey soil, soil with vegetation stubble, and very damp grey soil.

This dataset is a subset of a larger scene, comprising eighty-two rows and one hundred columns of pixels. Each row of data represents a three-by-three square neighborhood of pixels, containing the pixel values in four spectral bands of each of the nine pixels in the neighborhood, along with the classification label of the central pixel.

The Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. Integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions, including multi-spectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use, and more, is expected to become increasingly important in the field of remote sensing.

Existing statistical methods are limited in their ability to handle such diverse data types. However, for Landsat MSS data, which is numerical and has a single resolution, standard maximum likelihood classification performs exceptionally well. Therefore, comparing the performance of other methods against the statistical approach would be intriguing.

One frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these images are in the visible region, corresponding to the green and red regions of the visible spectrum, while the remaining two are in the near-infrared. Each pixel is an eight-bit binary word, ranging from zero, representing black, to two hundred fifty-five, representing white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is approximately eighty meters by eighty meters. Each image contains twenty-three forty pixels by thirty-three eighty pixels.

The data is presented in random order, and some lines of data have been removed, making it impossible to reconstruct the original image from this dataset. In each row of data, the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are listed first, followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel, and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on, with the pixels read out in sequence from left to right and top to bottom. As a result, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty. If desired, only these four attributes can be used, while ignoring the others, thus avoiding the problem that arises when a three-by-three neighborhood straddles a boundary.
