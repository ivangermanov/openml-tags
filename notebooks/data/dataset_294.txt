This dataset is part of forty-one drug design datasets, each containing one thousand one hundred forty-three features, which were generated using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs used in this dataset were taken from the original studies.

The Stevenson dataset was created from the original study by David E Patterson, which focused on neighborhood behavior and its role in validating molecular diversity descriptors.

Other datasets included in this collection are Carbolenes, MTP Two, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two. These datasets were created from various studies published in journals such as the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry and the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science.

The Carbolenes dataset was taken from a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen ninety-six, while the MTP Two dataset was derived from a study published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science in two thousand five.

Other notable datasets include Benzo Thirty-Two, which was created from a study published in the European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen ninety-six, and Phenethyl One, which was derived from a book chapter titled QSAR: Hansch Analysis and Related Approaches.

Keywords: drug design, molecular diversity descriptors, neighborhood behavior, QSAR, medicinal chemistry.
