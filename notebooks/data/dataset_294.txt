The satellite image dataset, tagged as study, contains multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods from a Landsat satellite image. The goal is to predict the classification of the central pixel in each neighbourhood based on these multi-spectral values. The classes are coded as numbers representing different soil and vegetation types.

This dataset is part of a broader effort to integrate diverse spatial data types for remote sensing applications, such as NASA's Earth Observing System. While existing statistical methods struggle with diverse data types, this particular Landsat MSS data is numerical and single-resolution, making it suitable for standard maximum-likelihood classification.

A Landsat MSS image frame consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands - two in the visible spectrum (green and red) and two in the near-infrared. Each pixel is represented by an 8-bit binary word, with values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). The spatial resolution is approximately 80m x 80m, with each full image containing 2340 x 3380 pixels.

The database represents a small 82 x 100 pixel sub-area of a larger scene. Each data entry corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood within this sub-area. The entry includes pixel values in four spectral bands for all nine pixels in the neighbourhood, along with a classification label for the central pixel.

The classification labels represent various soil and vegetation types, including red soil, cotton crop, grey soil, damp grey soil, soil with vegetation stubble, and very damp grey soil. The data is presented in random order, with some lines removed to prevent reconstruction of the original image.

The spectral values for each pixel are given in a specific order: top-left, top-middle, top-right, and so on, reading left-to-right and top-to-bottom. The central pixel's spectral values are represented by attributes 17, 18, 19, and 20. Users may choose to focus solely on these four attributes to avoid issues with neighbourhoods that cross boundaries.

All attributes are numerical, ranging from 0 to 255. The dataset does not contain any missing values.
