The United States Postal Service Dataset is a collection of normalized handwritten digits, automatically scanned from envelopes by the US Postal Service. The original scanned digits are binary and of different sizes and orientations; however, the images in this dataset have been deslanted and size-normalized, resulting in sixteen by sixteen grayscale images.

This dataset is made available online and consists of two compressed files. Each line in these files consists of the digit identification number, ranging from zero to nine, followed by two hundred fifty-six grayscale values. There are seven thousand two hundred ninety-one training observations and two thousand seven test observations, distributed across the ten digit classes.

The distribution of the training and test datasets is as follows: the training dataset contains approximately equal proportions of each digit class, while the test dataset is notoriously difficult, with a higher proportion of certain digits. A classification error rate of two point five percent is considered excellent for this dataset.

Alternatively, the training data are also available as separate files for each digit class, without the digit identifier in each row. This dataset was made available by the neural network group at a research laboratory.

The United States Postal Service Dataset is a challenging classification task, particularly due to the variability in handwriting styles and the difficulty of the test dataset. It requires sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy rates.
