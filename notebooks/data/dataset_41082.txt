The USPS dataset is a collection of normalized handwritten digits, automatically scanned from envelopes by the United States Postal Service. The original scanned digits are binary and of different sizes and orientations, but the images in this dataset have been deslanted and size normalized, resulting in sixteen by sixteen grayscale images. 

The data are distributed in two files, and each line consists of the digit identification followed by the two hundred fifty-six grayscale values. There are training observations and test observations, distributed as follows: 

The training data are available as separate files per digit, and hence without the digit identifier in each row. The test set is notoriously difficult, and an error rate is considered excellent. 

These data were made available by the neural network group at AT&T research labs.
