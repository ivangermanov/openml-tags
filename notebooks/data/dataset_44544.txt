Name: Gina Seed One, Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, One Hundred Columns, Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the Gina dataset with seed one, two thousand rows, one hundred columns, ten classes, and stratify true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using uniform random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, selecting a specified number of columns from the filtered data. If the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is maintained.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to strings and returns the new dataset with the selected features, target variable, and categorical mask.
