The Fri C Four Hundred Fifty Zero Fifty Dataset is a binarized regression problem that originated from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is part of several studies, including Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, and Study Eighty-Eight.

In this dataset, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive (denoted by 'P') and all others as Negative (denoted by 'N').

The dataset consists of various features, although some may be difficult to interpret due to their naming conventions.
