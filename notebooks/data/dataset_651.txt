The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is particularly useful because it includes a mix of relationships, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of algorithms.

To generate these datasets, five features were created for input, and then additional features were added to measure the effects of nonrelated features. These added features are independent from the output. Furthermore, to measure an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets were generated with five different collinearity degrees. Collinearity degree refers to the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values are varied to test different scenarios. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. Similarly, the number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand. Finally, the collinearity degrees range from zero to four.

For the datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features was generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets were generated by combining four different feature numbers, four different sample numbers, and five different collinearity degrees.

Each dataset has a target attribute at the end.
