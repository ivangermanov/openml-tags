Name: Connect Four Seed Two

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Connect Four with seed equals two arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. 

First, it samples the classes uniformly. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it samples the columns uniformly if required. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the columns randomly and filters the data accordingly.

Finally, it samples the rows. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

The function returns a dataset with the sampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
