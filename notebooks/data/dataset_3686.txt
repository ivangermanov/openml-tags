QSAR-TID-10014 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10014. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features of the dataset include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds.

The dataset is related to the Platelet Activating Factor Receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as PAFr, PAF-R, and Platelet-activating factor receptor, and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including chemotaxis, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also associated with lipopolysaccharide binding, lipopolysaccharide immune receptor activity, and phospholipid binding.
