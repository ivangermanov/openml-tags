The QSAR-TID-12078 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12078. This dataset has seventy rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for machine learning and computer systems research.

The drug target, GABA-B receptor one, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including signal transduction, chemical synaptic transmission, and response to nicotine.

The GABA-B receptor one is a member of the family C G protein-coupled receptor family and is primarily expressed in the brain, where it regulates various functions, including neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter release.

The receptor is composed of two subunits, GABA-B receptor one and two, which form a heterodimeric complex that binds to gamma-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, computer systems, GABA-B receptor, signal transduction, chemical synaptic transmission, family C G protein-coupled receptor.
