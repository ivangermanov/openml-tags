The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11379. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The Macrophage-Stimulating Protein Receptor is a single protein, also known as CD136, CDw136, Macrophage-Stimulating Protein Receptor Alpha Chain, and Macrophage-Stimulating Protein Receptor Beta Chain. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase, belonging to the tyrosine protein kinase group and Met family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including immune system process, protein phosphorylation, phagocytosis, defense response, signal transduction, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. It is also involved in nervous system development, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, response to virus, phosphorylation, cell migration, and positive regulation of kinase activity.

The receptor has been targeted by various compounds, including small molecules and antibodies, such as Glesatinib, Narnatumab, and MK-8033. These compounds have been shown to inhibit the receptor's activity, and have been investigated for their potential therapeutic effects.
