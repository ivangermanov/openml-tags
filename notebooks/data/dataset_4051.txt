MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-11379

Tags: Earth Science, Images, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11379. The dataset has four hundred twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset provides information about the macrophage-stimulating protein receptor, also known as CD136, CDw136, or Ron receptor. It is a single protein preferred name that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase met family.

The macrophage-stimulating protein receptor is involved in various biological processes, including immune system process, protein phosphorylation, phagocytosis, defense response, signal transduction, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, nervous system development, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, response to virus, phosphorylation, cell migration, positive regulation of kinase activity, macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of MAP kinase activity.
