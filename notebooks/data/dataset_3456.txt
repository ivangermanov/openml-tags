Corporate Credit Rating expresses the ability of a firm to repay its debt to creditors. Credit rating agencies are the entities responsible for making the assessment and giving a verdict. When a big corporation from the US or anywhere in the world wants to issue a new bond, it hires a credit agency to make an assessment so that investors can know how trustworthy the company is. The assessment is based especially on financial indicators that come from the balance sheet.

Some of the most important agencies in the world are Moody's, Fitch, and Standard and Poor's.

This dataset contains a list of credit ratings issued by major agencies such as Standard and Poor's to big US firms traded on NYSE or Nasdaq from 2010 to 2016. There are thirty features for every company, of which twenty-five are financial indicators. They can be divided into Liquidity Measurement Ratios, Profitability Indicator Ratios, Debt Ratios, Operating Performance Ratios, and Cash Flow Indicator Ratios.
