QSAR-TID-270 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta is a Single Protein and its Preferred Name is Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta. It has Synonyms such as HAP, HBV-activated protein, NR1B2, Nuclear receptor subfamily one group B member two, RARB. It is a Transcription factor/Nuclear receptor/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group B/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group B member two.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.

The dataset contains information about the Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta, a protein that is involved in various biological processes such as transcription, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. It is a nuclear receptor that is activated by retinoic acid and plays a crucial role in embryonic development and cell growth.
