The QSAR-TID-270 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 270. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

Features include molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The QSAR data in this dataset shows the activity values of several compounds on the Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta, which is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes.

The Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta is a single protein that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. It belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and is activated by retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A. The receptor is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

The dataset provides information on the structure-activity relationships of various compounds on the Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta, which can be useful for the design and development of new drugs targeting this receptor.
