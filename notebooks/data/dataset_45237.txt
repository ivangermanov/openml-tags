**Link Bayesian Network. Sample 7.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete very large dataset.

This dataset has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, while the average degree is moderate. The maximum in-degree is also moderate.

The dataset is characterized by a complex structure, with many nodes and arcs. The number of parameters is substantial, indicating a high degree of complexity.

The average Markov blanket size is an important feature of this dataset, indicating the average number of variables that are directly connected to each node. The average degree, on the other hand, represents the average number of connections each node has.

The maximum in-degree is another important feature, indicating the maximum number of incoming connections to a single node.
