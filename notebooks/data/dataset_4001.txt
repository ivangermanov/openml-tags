Eucalyptus Species Selection for Soil Conservation in Seasonally Dry Hill Country 

Find out which seed lots in a species are best for soil conservation in dry hill country. 

The dataset includes features such as abbreviation, repetition, locality, map reference, latitude, altitude, rainfall, frosts, year, species, plant moisture content number, diameter at breast height, height, survival, vigor, insect resistance, stem form, crown form, branch form, and utility.

Machine learning was applied to this dataset to determine the most suitable seed lots for soil conservation. The goal is to identify the optimal seed lots that can thrive in seasonally dry hill country, promoting effective soil conservation.

The research aims to provide valuable insights into the selection of eucalyptus species for soil conservation, taking into account various environmental factors such as rainfall, altitude, and frosts.
