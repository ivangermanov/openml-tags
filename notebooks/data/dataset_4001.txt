QSAR-TID-100042 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100042. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dipeptidyl Peptidase Two. This enzyme is also known as Dipeptidyl Aminopeptidase Two, Dipeptidyl Peptidase Seven, and Dipeptidyl Peptidase Two. It belongs to the species Rattus norvegicus and is classified as a single protein.

The protein target classification is one point enzyme, protease, serine protease, serine protease SC clan, and serine protease S twenty-eight family. The description of this enzyme is that it is a dipeptidyl peptidase two.

The dataset also contains information about the protein's component, function, and process. The component information includes extracellular region, lysosome, cytoplasmic vesicle, and vesicle. The function information includes aminopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, dipeptidyl-peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. The process information includes proteolysis, protein catabolic process, and lysosomal protein catabolic process.

Additionally, the dataset contains cross-references to other databases, including canSAR-Target, IntAct, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro.
