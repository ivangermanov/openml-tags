USA Airport Dataset 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is a comprehensive record of United States domestic flights from nineteen ninety to two thousand nine. It has been sourced from the OpenFlights website, which boasts an extensive database of various travel modes across the globe. I stumbled upon this dataset while preparing for a hackathon and thought it merited inclusion on Kaggle's dataset list.

What does it contain? 
The dataset encompasses a multitude of attributes, including the three-letter airport codes for both the origin and destination airports, the respective city names, the number of passengers transported between the two locations, the total number of available seats, the frequency of flights, the distance traversed, and the specific date of each flight. Additionally, it includes demographic data regarding the populations of both origin and destination cities, as per reports from the United States Census.

Where did I obtain it? 
I extend my gratitude to the creator of this dataset for their diligent efforts in compiling this valuable resource. In the future, I plan to update the dataset to incorporate additional attributes that may yield further insights into this dataset.
