QSAR-TID-10614 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10614. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is focused on providing high-quality data that can be used for machine learning and predictive modeling.

The dataset is related to the Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP2 subtype, which is a single protein with multiple functions. It is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including predictive modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization. It is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.
