QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Cholecystokinin B receptor, a single protein target found in Canis lupus familiaris. This receptor is also known as the Gastrin/cholecystokinin type B receptor. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane-bounded organelles.

The Cholecystokinin B receptor has several important functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, cholecystokinin receptor activity, gastrin receptor activity, and peptide hormone binding. It is involved in various biological processes such as gastric acid secretion, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

This receptor plays a role in multiple developmental processes, including digestive tract development and gland development. It is also involved in the cholecystokinin signaling pathway and contributes to pH reduction in the body.

The dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying drug interactions with the Cholecystokinin B receptor, potentially leading to new insights in areas such as gastrointestinal physiology, signal transduction, and drug development.
