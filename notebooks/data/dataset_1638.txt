QSAR-TID-12128 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12128, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit zero, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit one, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit two, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit three, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit four, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit five, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit six, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit seven, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit eight, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit nine, Fingerprint six one zero two four bit ten, and many more.
