Cacao Flavor Tags: Chocolate Bar Ratings

Expert ratings of over one thousand seven hundred chocolate bars are compiled in this database. Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. Batch numbers, vintages, and review dates are included in the database when known.

The database is narrowly focused on plain dark chocolate with an aim of appreciating the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status. Flavor is the most important component of the Flavors of Cacao ratings. Diversity, balance, intensity, and purity of flavors are all considered. It is possible for a straightforward single-note chocolate to rate as high as a complex flavor profile that changes throughout. Genetics, terroir, post-harvest techniques, processing, and storage can all be discussed when considering the flavor component.

Texture has a great impact on the overall experience, and it is also possible for texture-related issues to impact flavor. It is a good way to evaluate the maker's vision, attention to detail, and level of proficiency. Aftermelt is the experience after the chocolate has melted. Higher-quality chocolate will linger and be long-lasting and enjoyable. Since the aftermelt is the last impression you get from the chocolate, it receives equal importance in the overall rating.

Overall Opinion is really where the ratings reflect a subjective opinion. Ideally, it is an evaluation of whether or not the components above worked together and an opinion on the flavor development, character, and style. It is also here where each chocolate can usually be summarized by the most prominent impressions that you would remember about each chocolate.

Flavors of Cacao Rating System:

Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
Premium (Superior flavor development, character, and style)
