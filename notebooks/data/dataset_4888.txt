The Ovarian dataset, tagged with Geography and Microarray, consists of various features. This dataset was used to identify ovarian cancer through proteomic patterns in serum.

The Ovarian dataset features a wide range of attributes, including mass-to-charge ratio values, which are essential for understanding protein expression levels in biological samples.

In this study, researchers employed the Ovarian dataset to develop a novel approach for detecting ovarian cancer using proteomic patterns in serum. The dataset proved instrumental in identifying potential biomarkers for this devastating disease.
