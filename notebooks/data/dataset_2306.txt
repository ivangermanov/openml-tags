QSAR-TID-10294 Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10294. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These molecular fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It should be cited accordingly.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The remaining features are molecular fingerprints, specifically FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

This dataset contains information about the Cannabinoid CB two receptor, also known as Cannabinoid receptor two or CB two. It is a single protein and its preferred name is Cannabinoid CB two receptor. Its synonyms include Cannabinoid receptor two, CB two, CB- two, Cnr two, and mCB two.

This receptor is found in the Mus musculus species group and belongs to the one membrane receptor family, A G protein-coupled receptor subfamily, small molecule receptor subfamily, lipid-like ligand receptor subfamily, and Cannabinoid receptor family. 

According to its description, this receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, regulation of metabolic process, leukocyte chemotaxis, negative regulation of synaptic transmission, response to lipopolysaccharide, negative regulation of mast cell activation, Cannabinoid signaling pathway, negative regulation of action potential, and response to stimulus.
