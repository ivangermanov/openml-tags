Spoken Arabic Digit Dataset

Tags: Abstract

This dataset contains time series of mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients corresponding to spoken Arabic digits. It includes data from male and female native Arabic speakers. The data was collected by the Laboratory of Automatic and Signals at the University of Badji-Mokhtar Annaba, Algeria.

The dataset was adapted and preprocessed by the Faculty of Engineering at Al-Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The dataset consists of time series of thirteen frequency cepstral coefficients taken from native Arabic speakers between the ages of eighteen and forty to represent ten spoken Arabic digits.

Each line in the database represents thirteen mel frequency cepstral coefficients in increasing order, separated by spaces, corresponding to one analysis frame. The thirteen mel frequency cepstral coefficients were computed with the following conditions: a sampling rate of eleven thousand twenty-five hertz, sixteen bits, a hamming window applied, and a filter pre-emphasized.

The dataset is relevant to research in speech recognition and has been used in previous studies.
