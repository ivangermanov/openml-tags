This dataset contains records of simulation crashes encountered during climate model uncertainty quantification ensembles. The ensemble members were constructed using a Latin hypercube method in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Uncertainty Quantification Pipeline software system. The purpose was to sample the uncertainties of model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program component of the Community Climate System Model.

Three separate Latin hypercube ensembles were conducted, each containing ensemble members. A subset of the simulations failed for numerical reasons at certain combinations of parameter values. The primary goal of this dataset is to use classification techniques to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) based on input parameter values. Additionally, sensitivity analysis and feature selection methods can be employed to determine the underlying causes of simulation crashes.

The dataset includes information on Latin hypercube study ID, simulation ID, values of climate model parameters scaled in a specific interval, and simulation outcomes. The parameters have been scaled to maintain consistency and facilitate analysis. The simulation outcomes are binary, with failures represented by and successes represented by.

This data was constructed using Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Uncertainty Quantification Pipeline and was created under the auspices of the US Department of Energy. It was funded by the laboratory's Uncertainty Quantification Strategic Initiative Laboratory Directed Research and Development Project.

The dataset provides an opportunity for researchers to explore the relationships between climate model input parameters and simulation outcomes. By analyzing this data, scientists can gain insights into the factors that contribute to simulation failures and potentially improve the robustness of climate models.
