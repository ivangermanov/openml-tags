QSAR-TID-64 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Vitamin D Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Vitamin D Receptor. The Vitamin D Receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor, NR1I1, Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 1, and VDR. It is a transcription factor, nuclear receptor, and nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 1 group I member 1.

The Vitamin D Receptor is a nuclear receptor that mediates the action of vitamin D, a hormone that plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and bone health. The receptor is involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to vitamin D, and it plays a key role in the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.

The dataset contains multiple compounds that have been tested for their activity on the Vitamin D Receptor, and the activity values are represented as pseudo-pCI50. The compounds were obtained from ChEMBL, a large database of bioactive molecules, and the activity values were generated using a QSAR model.

The features of the dataset represent the molecular fingerprints of the compounds, which were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program. The molecular fingerprints are a way of representing the molecular structure of a compound in a numerical format, and they can be used to predict the activity of a compound on a particular target.

The dataset can be used for a variety of purposes, including the development of new drugs that target the Vitamin D Receptor, and the prediction of the activity of compounds on the receptor.
