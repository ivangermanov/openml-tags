This collection includes datasets of one dimensional ultrasound raw Radio Frequency data, also known as A-Scans, acquired from the Biceps Brachii muscles of a healthy individual. The annotation was performed by labeling the initial period of each dataset as belonging to a Relaxed Muscle State and the latter period of each dataset as belonging to a Fatigue Muscle State.

Each line of the Attribute Relation File Format file contains an A-Scan consisting of amplitude values, an annotation indicating whether this A-Scan belongs to a Fatigue Muscle State or not, a timestamp, the position of the arm from which the signals were obtained, the identifier of the subject, the identifier of the dataset, the gender of the subject, and the chosen lifted weight.
