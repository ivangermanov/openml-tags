QSAR-TID-10190 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10190. The dataset has sixty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10190. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Galanin receptor one, which is a single protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The Galanin receptor one is a membrane receptor that is involved in various physiological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, cytosolic calcium ion concentration, and cortisol secretion.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for the Galanin receptor one, as well as for those who are interested in understanding the structure-activity relationships of compounds that interact with this receptor.
