Fri C4 Dataset 

This dataset is categorized under Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and other relevant topics. 

A binarized version of the original dataset has been created, which involves converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process is achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset comprises numerous features, including Oz One, Oz Two, Oz Three, and so on, up to Oz Fifty.
