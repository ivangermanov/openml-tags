Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). 

Features: The dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers. These features are not easily human-readable and have been omitted. The final feature is binaryClass.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been converted into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the original target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value fell below or above this mean threshold. This binarization technique allows for the application of classification algorithms to what may have originally been a regression task.

The dataset likely contains multiple numerical features that could be used to predict the binary outcome. While the specific nature of these features is unclear from the given information, they may represent various measurements or attributes relevant to the study's focus areas, as indicated by the diverse range of study tags associated with the dataset.
