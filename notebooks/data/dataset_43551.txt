Name: Employee Turnover at TechCo
Tags: Context

These are simulated data based on employee turnover data in a real technology company in India, which we refer to by the pseudonym TechCo. These data can be used to analyze the drivers of turnover at TechCo. The original dataset was analyzed in a paper, and this publicly offered dataset is simulated based on the original data for privacy considerations. Along with the accompanying Python Kaggle code and R Kaggle code, this dataset will help readers learn how to implement machine learning techniques in the paper. The data and code demonstrate how machine learning can be useful for discovering nonlinear and interactive patterns between variables that may otherwise have gone unnoticed.

Content
This dataset includes entry-level employees who were quasi-randomly deployed to any of TechCo's geographically dispersed production centers. The data are structured as a panel with one observation for each month that an individual is employed at the company. The data include observations from employees total; the dependent variable, Turnover, indicates whether the employee left or stayed during that time period.

Objectives
The objective in the original paper was to explore patterns in the data that would help us learn more about the drivers of employee turnover. Another objective could be to find the best predictive model to estimate when a specific employee will leave.

Features
The dataset includes variables such as time, training score, logical score, verbal score, average literacy, location age, distance, similar language, and gender.
