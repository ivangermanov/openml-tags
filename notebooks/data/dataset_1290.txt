This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Prostanoid EP3 Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features representing FCFP 1024 bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it for your research purposes.

The Prostanoid EP3 Receptor is a single protein target classified under Family A G-protein coupled receptor, specifically a Lipid-like Ligand Receptor. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways.

The receptor is also associated with multiple Gene Ontology terms, including G-protein coupled receptor activity, prostaglandin receptor activity, and protein binding. Additionally, it participates in numerous biological processes, such as fever generation, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, desensitization of G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, and inflammatory response.
