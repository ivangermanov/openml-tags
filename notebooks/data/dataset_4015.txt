QSAR-TID-11575 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11575. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1490 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The C-C chemokine receptor type 2 is a single protein preferred name, also known as C-C chemokine receptor type 2, C-C CKR-2, CC-CKR-2, CCR2, and CCR-2. It is a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and chemokine receptor.

The protein target classification is 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Chemokine receptor/CC chemokine receptor.

The description relationship accession is C-C chemokine receptor type 2, SINGLE PROTEIN, P41597.

The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is No Protein Target Classification.

The protein target is classified as 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Chemokine receptor/CC chemokine receptor.

The dataset contains information on the parent molecule ChEMBL ID, parent molecule name, parent molecule type, mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval.

The C-C chemokine receptor type 2 is involved in various biological processes, including blood vessel remodeling, dendritic cell chemotaxis, monocyte chemotaxis, regulation of T cell cytokine production, and positive regulation of T-helper 1 type immune response.

The receptor is also involved in negative regulation of type 2 immune response, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, humoral immune response, cellular defense response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
