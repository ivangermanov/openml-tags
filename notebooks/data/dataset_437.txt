This dataset, named garrat, is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset is derived from research on molecular descriptors and their influence on various chemical and biological properties. It includes information related to melting points, molecular diversity, pharmacological evaluations, and structure-activity relationships of different compounds.

Some of the original studies focused on topics such as carbolenes, molecular descriptors influencing melting points, neighborhood behavior for validating molecular diversity descriptors, general melting point prediction, and syntheses of compounds as ligands for benzodiazepine receptors.

Other studies explored quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors, prediction of biological activity for PDGFR inhibitors, structure-biodegradability relationships, and quantitative structure-function relationships of purposely modified proteins.

The research also covered areas like acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradability of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, and stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion.

These datasets are valuable resources for drug design, toxicology, and computational chemistry, providing insights into the relationships between molecular structures and their properties or activities.
