QSAR-TID-10113 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10113. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The dataset is related to the somatostatin receptor two, which is a single protein. Its preferred name is somatostatin receptor two, and its synonyms include somatostatin receptor type two, SRIF-one, SS two R, and SS-two-R. It is found in the rat species and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The somatostatin receptor two is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, spermatogenesis, cerebellum development, peristalsis, forebrain development, cellular response to hormone stimulus, somatostatin signaling pathway, response to starvation, cellular response to glucocorticoid stimulus, cellular response to estradiol stimulus, and cellular response to lipid.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, somatostatin receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, neuropeptide signaling pathway.
