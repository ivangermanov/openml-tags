The Diamonds dataset is a classic collection of data that contains the prices and other attributes of a large number of diamonds. It is an excellent dataset for beginners learning to work with data analysis and visualization. 

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. The dataset has been transformed in the same way as the dataset used in the tabular data benchmark.

The dataset contains the following information about each diamond: the price in US dollars, the carat weight of the diamond, the quality of the cut, the color of the diamond, and the clarity of the diamond. The quality of the cut is categorized as Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, or Ideal. The color of the diamond is categorized from J, which is the worst, to D, which is the best. The clarity of the diamond is a measurement of how clear the diamond is, and it is categorized as I1, which is the worst, to IF, which is the best.

In addition to these attributes, the dataset also contains the length, width, and depth of the diamond in millimeters. The total depth percentage is calculated as the depth divided by the mean of the length and width, or two times the depth divided by the sum of the length and width. The table width is the width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.

The dataset can be used to analyze the relationship between the attributes of the diamonds and their prices.
