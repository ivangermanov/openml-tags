The dataset named AP Omentum Kidney includes gene expression data that can be used for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms in the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. The dataset is sourced from the GEMLeR repository, which provides a collection of gene expression datasets from the expO (Expression Project For Oncology) repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The goal of expO is to analyze gene expression in tumor samples under standard conditions and release the data into the public domain for research purposes. The dataset in GEMLeR is chosen for its consistency in tissue sample processing, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, and the availability of additional information for genotype-phenotype studies. Researchers are encouraged to cite the dataset when using it for their experiments to acknowledge the assistance received. The features included in the dataset are various gene expression identifiers. The dataset is valuable for classification, feature selection, and clustering algorithms in bioinformatics and machine learning research. Keywords: gene expression, machine learning, bioinformatics, expO, GEMLeR, tumor samples, microarray platform, benchmarking, classification, feature selection.
