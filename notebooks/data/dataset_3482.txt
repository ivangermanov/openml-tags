QSAR-TID-12090 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12090. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains a wide range of features, including molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the structural properties of molecules. These features are essential for building predictive models that can accurately predict the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for the drug target TID: 12090, which can be used to build predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.
