Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed Two Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed with seed equal to two, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. The function first uniformly samples classes from the unique values in the target variable y, and selects the indices where one of these classes is present. It then uniformly samples columns if required, and selects the corresponding columns. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, it stratifies the data accordingly and selects a subset of the data. Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a dataset with the selected features, target variable, categorical mask, and columns.

Features: 

The dataset has thirty two features, including Phase.
