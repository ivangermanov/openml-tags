Machine Learning Dataset: Helena 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Helena dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset. 

The Helena dataset underwent uniform sampling of its classes, ensuring that all classes were represented proportionally. This was achieved by selecting a specified number of classes using their value counts as probabilities. The resulting classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the samples belonging to the chosen classes.

Subsequently, the dataset underwent column selection, where a specified number of columns were randomly chosen. This selection was performed uniformly, without any bias towards specific columns. The resulting columns formed the new feature set for the subsampled dataset.

Finally, the dataset underwent row sampling, where a specified number of samples were randomly chosen while maintaining the proportional representation of classes. This ensured that the subsampled dataset retained the original class distribution.
