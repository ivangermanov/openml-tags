The Primary Biliary Cirrhosis dataset is a collection of four hundred eighteen observations, each representing a patient, with twenty variables recorded from the Mayo Clinic trial.

This dataset contains information from four hundred twenty-four patients who met the eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo-controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine, conducted between nineteen seventy-four and nineteen eighty-four. Three hundred twelve cases participated in the randomized trial, and their data is largely complete. The remaining one hundred twelve cases did not participate in the clinical trial but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.

Missing data items are denoted by a period. Each variable in the dataset file is separated by at least one space. Censoring was due to liver transplantation for twenty-five subjects.

The variables contained in the dataset are:

* Case number
* The number of days between registration and the earlier of death, liver transplantation, or study analysis time
* Death indicator, where one indicates time to death and zero indicates time to censoring
* Treatment code, where one represents D-penicillamine and two represents placebo
* Age in years
* Sex, where zero represents male and one represents female
* Presence of ascites, where zero represents no and one represents yes
* Presence of hepatomegaly, where zero represents no and one represents yes
* Presence of spiders, where zero represents no and one represents yes
* Presence of edema, where zero represents no edema, zero point five represents edema present without diuretic therapy, and one represents edema despite diuretic therapy
* Serum bilirubin
* Serum cholesterol
* Albumin
* Urine copper
* Alkaline phosphatase
* SGOT
* Triglycerides
* Platelet count
* Prothrombin time
* Histologic stage of disease, graded from one to four

This dataset provides an opportunity to study the natural history of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, a rare but fatal chronic liver disease of unknown cause. The data can be used to estimate a survival distribution, test for differences between two groups, and estimate covariate effects via a regression model.
