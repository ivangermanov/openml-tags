The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number".

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation. This function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is a complex equation that takes into account multiple variables and their interactions.

To generate these datasets, five features were initially used as inputs, but to measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features were added. These extra features are independent of the output. Furthermore, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets were generated with five different colinearity degrees. Colinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are as follows: the number of features varies, with only the first five being related to the output; the remaining features are completely random. The number of samples also varies. Additionally, the colinearity degrees range from zero to four. For datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is limited to specific values.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets were generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. Each dataset has a target attribute, which is the last attribute in each file.
