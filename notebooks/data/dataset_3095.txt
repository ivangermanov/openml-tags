This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred ten thousand one hundred five, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Data was scraped from various sources including Uniprot, InterPro, Pfam, and others. The preferred name for this target is Cathepsin B, also known as Cathepsin B one, Cathepsin B heavy chain, Cathepsin B light chain, and Ctsb. It belongs to the species Mus musculus and is classified under the enzyme/protease/cysteine protease category.

This protein is involved in various biological processes including proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, negative regulation of peptidase activity, protein catabolic process, collagen catabolic process, epithelial cell differentiation, decidualization, viral entry into host cell, regulation of catalytic activity, neuron apoptotic process, and cellular response to thyroid hormone stimulus.

It is also associated with multiple cellular components including extracellular region, extracellular space, mitochondrion, lysosome, plasma membrane, caveola, external side of plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, apical plasma membrane, sarcolemma, melanosome, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, and peptidase inhibitor complex.
