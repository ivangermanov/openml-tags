QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Cathepsin B, a single protein target found in Mus musculus. Cathepsin B is also known as Cathepsin B, Cathepsin B heavy chain, Cathepsin B light chain, and Ctsb. It is classified as an enzyme, specifically a cysteine protease in the CA clan and C family.

Cathepsin B is involved in various cellular processes and locations. It can be found in the extracellular region, extracellular space, mitochondrion, lysosome, plasma membrane, caveola, cell surface, and other cellular compartments. Its functions include endopeptidase activity, cysteine type endopeptidase activity, collagen binding, peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, kininogen binding, peptide binding, and protein self association.

The protein is involved in numerous biological processes such as proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, regulation of peptidase activity, protein catabolic processes, collagen catabolic processes, epithelial cell differentiation, decidualization, viral entry into host cells, regulation of catalytic activity, neuron apoptotic processes, and cellular response to thyroid hormone stimulus.

Cathepsin B is associated with several pathways and processes, including collagen degradation, trafficking and processing of endosomal TLR, assembly of collagen fibrils, MHC class II antigen presentation, and neutrophil degranulation. It is referenced in various databases such as canSAR Target, IntAct, MICAD, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
