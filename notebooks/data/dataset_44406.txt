Name: Bank Marketing Seed Four 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Bank Marketing generated with a specific set of arguments.

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Bank Marketing dataset, which contains forty-four thousand one hundred twenty-six entries. The subsampling process involved selecting a limited number of rows, columns, and classes while maintaining the overall distribution of the data.

The subsampling method used a uniform sampling approach to select the desired number of classes, ensuring that each class had an equal probability of being chosen. Once the classes were selected, the corresponding data points were retained, and the rest were discarded.

A similar approach was employed to sample the columns, where a specified number of columns were randomly chosen from the original dataset. The resulting dataset consists of the selected columns and their corresponding values.

To maintain the stratification of the data, the sampling method employed a stratified split, which ensured that the distribution of the target variable was preserved. This was achieved by using a random state to ensure reproducibility.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original data, with a reduced number of rows, columns, and classes. The categorical variables have been converted to strings to facilitate further processing.
