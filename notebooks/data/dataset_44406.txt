Name: Bank Marketing Seed Four

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Bank Marketing with seed equals four

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in several parameters, including a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. The indices where one of these classes is present are selected, and the corresponding data is subsetted.

If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, the function uniformly samples the columns. It then selects the corresponding columns from the data.

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data accordingly and selects a subset of the data using train test split.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string and returns a dataset with the subsetted data, the categorical mask, and the column names.
