Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi class target feature is converted to a two class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains multiple input features and a binary class feature. The input features are numbered sequentially from one to sixteen, representing various attributes of the data. The final feature, binaryClass, indicates the classification outcome.

This dataset is a modified version of an earlier collection, with the primary change being the conversion of the target variable from multiple classes to a binary classification. This transformation was achieved by designating the most common class as positive and grouping all other classes as negative. The purpose of this modification may be to simplify the classification task or to focus on distinguishing one particular class from all others.

The dataset appears to be related to digit recognition or handwriting analysis, given its name "Pendigits". It likely contains information about handwritten numerical digits, possibly including characteristics such as stroke patterns, angles, or other relevant features used in digit identification.
