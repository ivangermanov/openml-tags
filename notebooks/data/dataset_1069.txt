This dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. It contains data from flight software for an earth orbiting satellite. The data was extracted using McCabe and Halstead feature extractors applied to the source code. These features were defined in the 1970s as an attempt to objectively characterize code attributes associated with software quality.

The PC2 dataset is used for software defect prediction research. It includes various code metrics and features that aim to quantify different aspects of software complexity and structure. These metrics include measures of code size, complexity, and readability.

Relevant papers discuss data quality issues in NASA software defect datasets, blind spot sampling policies in software engineering, and assessing predictors of software defects. These studies explore the effectiveness of different approaches to predicting and analyzing software defects using metrics-based data.

The dataset contains numerous features related to code structure and complexity, including counts of branches, call pairs, lines of code, comments, cyclomatic complexity, and various Halstead metrics. These features provide a multifaceted view of the software's characteristics, allowing researchers to investigate potential correlations between code attributes and defect proneness.

Software defect prediction is an important area of study in software engineering, as it aims to identify potential issues early in the development process. By analyzing historical data and code metrics, researchers and practitioners hope to develop more effective methods for improving software quality and reducing the occurrence of defects in complex systems like satellite flight software.
