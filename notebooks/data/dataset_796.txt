CPU Dataset: A Binarized Version of the Original Data Set 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The conversion process involved transforming the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features related to computer processing units, including the Vendor, Maximum Cache, Minimum Cache, and other relevant characteristics.
