Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on CPU characteristics and performance metrics. It has been processed to create a binary classification problem from the original numeric data. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean value. This binarization allows for simplified analysis and machine learning tasks.

Features included in the dataset are vendor, MYCT, MMIN, MMAX, CACH, CHMIN, CHMAX, and binaryClass. These features likely represent various aspects of CPU specifications and performance indicators, though some may require domain-specific knowledge to fully interpret.

The dataset's origin and creation date are not specified, highlighting the importance of proper documentation and attribution in data science. Researchers and practitioners using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work.
