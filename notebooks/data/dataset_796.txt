Molecular Biology Promoters Dataset 

This dataset is related to chemistry and life science. It has been binarized from its original form. The multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was done by re-labeling the majority class as positive and all other classes as negative.

Features of this dataset include class, instance, and various promoter regions.
