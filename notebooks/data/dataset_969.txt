Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

This dataset contains information about iris flowers, including measurements of their sepals and petals. The features include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem, where the majority class is labeled as positive and all other classes are labeled as negative.

The Iris dataset is commonly used in machine learning and statistical analysis for tasks such as classification and clustering. It provides a straightforward example for testing various algorithms and techniques in data science and pattern recognition.
