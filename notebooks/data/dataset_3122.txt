QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and numerous FCFP fingerprint bits.

The dataset pertains to Caspase, also known as APAF, Apoptotic protease activating factor, Apoptotic protease Mch, CASP, CASP. It is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Cysteine protease/Cysteine protease CD clan/Cysteine protease C family.

Caspase is involved in various biological processes including apoptosis, proteolysis, protein processing, and cellular responses to different stimuli. It has multiple molecular functions such as cysteine type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, and enzyme activator activity. The protein is found in several cellular components including the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and apoptosome.

The dataset includes information on related molecules, their mechanisms of action, and development phases. It also provides links to various biological databases and resources containing additional information about Caspase, its structure, interactions, and role in different pathways.

This QSAR dataset aims to facilitate the study of compound activity on Caspase, potentially aiding in drug discovery and development efforts targeting this important apoptosis related protein.
