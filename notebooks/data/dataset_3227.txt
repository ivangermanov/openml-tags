QSAR-TID-100867 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2 is a single protein, also known as FFA2, FFAR2, GPCR43, and GPR43. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a Small molecule receptor. It is involved in the regulation of acute inflammatory response, immune system process, mucosal immune response, and other biological processes.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
