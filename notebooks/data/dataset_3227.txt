Label Ranking for Meteorological Applications 

This dataset focuses on the task of label ranking, which is a machine learning approach used to predict the order of relevance or importance of a set of labels or categories given an instance or sample. In the context of meteorology, this task is particularly useful for predicting the severity or impact of weather phenomena, such as storms or heatwaves.

The dataset consists of various features that are relevant to meteorological applications, including atmospheric conditions, temperature readings, humidity levels, wind speeds, and other environmental factors that can influence the weather.

By using machine learning algorithms to rank labels, researchers and practitioners can develop more accurate and effective systems for predicting and preparing for severe weather events, ultimately leading to better decision-making and improved public safety.
