This dataset is one of two multivariate regression datasets from the paper industry, originating from an experiment conducted at the paper plant Norske Skog, located in Skogn, Norway.

The dataset has been thoroughly described and analyzed in a research paper titled "Moderate Projection Pursuit Regression for Multivariate Response Data," which was published in the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis.

It comprises thirty observations and twenty-two variables, although it is essential to note that all response variables are missing for the twenty-eighth observation. The first thirteen columns consist of response variables that describe various qualities of the paper, while the remaining nine columns represent predictor variables.

Three predictor variables were systematically varied throughout the experiment, taking on specific values. The subsequent three predictor variables were constructed as squares of the initial three variables, followed by the last three predictor variables, which were created as products of the initial three variables.

Features: response one, response two, response three, response four, response five, response six, response seven, response eight, response nine, response ten, response eleven, response twelve, response thirteen, variable one, variable two, variable three
