This dataset originates from an experiment conducted at a paper plant in Norway. It is one of two multivariate regression datasets from the paper industry. The data has been analyzed and described in a published paper focusing on moderate projection pursuit regression for multivariate response data.

The dataset comprises observations and variables, with one observation missing all response variables. The variables are divided into response variables and predictor variables. The response variables describe various qualities of the paper. The predictor variables include systematically varied factors and constructed variables based on combinations and squares of the primary factors.

The first set of predictor variables were systematically varied throughout the experiment, taking on values of positive one, zero, and negative one. Additional predictor variables were constructed by squaring these primary variables and creating interaction terms between them.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying the relationships between paper production factors and resulting paper qualities. It offers opportunities for multivariate analysis and regression modeling in the context of industrial processes and quality control.

The data is available through StatLib, a statistical data repository. Researchers using this dataset are requested to cite the original publication that describes and analyzes it.
