QSAR-TID-12861 Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12861, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule Chembl ID and Median Px C50. 

The features represent Finger Print Counting Fingerprint six one hundred twenty four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from Smiles strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Meta QSAR project was conducted in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains information about a single protein preferred name Adamt s Four also known as Adamt s Four Adamts Four a Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs Four. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens. It is classified under enzyme protease metallo protease mam clan metallo protease m twelve b subfamily.

The expression atlas includes one component. The go function includes multiple components such as protease binding metalloendopeptidase activity protein binding peptidase activity metallopeptidase activity zinc ion binding hydrolase activity and metal ion binding.
