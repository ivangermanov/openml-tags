The Three-Dimensional Location Estimation Using Received Signal Strength Indication of Wireless Local Area Network Dataset Challenge aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning-based localization algorithm that can accurately estimate the position of a receiver based on Received Signal Strength Indication information from surrounding radio transmitters, including height information, thereby enabling the estimation of the target's three-dimensional location.

Features: Index, Unix Time, Service Set Identifier, Frequency, Channel, Received Signal Strength Indication, Access Point Latitude, Access Point Longitude, Distance to Access Point One, Distance to Access Point Two, Distance to Access Point Three, Distance to Access Point Four, Latitude, Longitude, Receiver Height, Split.

Keywords: Three-Dimensional Location Estimation, Received Signal Strength Indication, Wireless Local Area Network, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Localization Algorithm.
