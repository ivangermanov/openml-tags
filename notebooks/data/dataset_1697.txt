This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Phosphorylase Kinase Gamma Subunit Two, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

QSAR-TID-One Two Seven Three Five dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version Seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Phosphorylase Kinase Gamma Subunit Two, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September Two Thousand Fifteen.
