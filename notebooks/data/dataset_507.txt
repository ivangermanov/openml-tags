This georeferenced dataset was used in a study published in Geographical Analysis. It contains observations on U.S. county votes cast in the presidential election. The dataset includes information on the total number of votes cast per county, the population aged eighteen or older, the population with a twelfth grade or higher education, the number of owner-occupied housing units, the aggregate income, and the X and Y spatial coordinates of each county.

The dependent variable is the logarithm of the proportion of votes cast for both candidates in the presidential election, expressed as ln(VOTES/POP) = ln(VOTES) - ln(POP). The overall dataset structure includes these variables along with population, education, housing, income, and coordinate data.
