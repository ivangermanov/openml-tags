Space Ga Dataset

This georeferenced dataset was used in a study on geographical analysis of spatial data. It contains observations on United States county votes cast in the presidential election. Specifically, it includes the total number of votes cast per county, the population of eighteen years of age or older, the population with a twelfth grade or higher education, the number of owner occupied housing units, the aggregate income, and the x and y spatial coordinates of the county.

The dependent variable is the logarithm of the proportion of votes cast for both candidates in the presidential election. This can be expressed as the logarithm of votes divided by population minus the logarithm of population.

The overall dataset has a structure that includes the logarithm of votes divided by population, population, education, houses, income, x coordinate, and y coordinate.

Additional details about this dataset, including manuscripts, free spatial software, and more, can be found online. The manuscript that used this dataset is also available for download. For any questions, contact via email.
