Running Log Insight Tags: Content 

All data was collected via my Garmin Global Positioning System watch and uploaded to Garmin Connect via Bluetooth technology. There are gaps in my log, the largest being from the summer to about the spring of the following year, during which time I took a break from running after graduating from college where I used to run competitively. My Global Positioning System watch also has a wrist-based heart rate monitor, although it is not always entirely accurate. Similarly, occasionally the Global Positioning System had some minor inaccuracies as well, though subjectively I felt this occurred less frequently.

Acknowledgments 

Thank you to Garmin Connect for making it easy to export this data and to my hardworking legs for their tireless efforts.

Inspiration 

Based on my comprehensive training log data, can you accurately estimate my overall fitness level as a function of time? Specifically, when was my fitness level maximized? I have a detailed record of when I achieved all of my personal best times, so that could be an excellent way to verify if your estimation is correct.
