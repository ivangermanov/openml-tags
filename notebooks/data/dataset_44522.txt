Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses random number generation to select a specified number of rows, columns, and classes from the original dataset. The function first selects the classes, then the columns, and finally the rows. It uses stratified sampling to ensure that the selected rows are representative of the original dataset.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes to select, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratified sampling. It returns a new dataset with the selected rows, columns, and classes.
