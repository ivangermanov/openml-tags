QSAR-TID-100865 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Ghrelin Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Ghrelin Receptor. The Ghrelin Receptor is a single protein, also known as Ghrelin/Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor, and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The Ghrelin Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, actin polymerization or depolymerization, adult feeding behavior, response to hormone, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, growth hormone secretion, response to food, positive regulation of appetite, negative regulation of interleukin-1 beta production, negative regulation of interleukin-6 production, negative regulation of tumor necrosis factor production, cellular response to insulin stimulus, positive regulation of multicellular organism growth, positive regulation of insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway, decidualization, insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway, negative regulation of inflammatory response, and regulation of synapse assembly.
