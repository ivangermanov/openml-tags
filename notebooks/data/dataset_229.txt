This dataset, known as pwLinear, is a synthetic dataset used for regression tasks. It contains multiple numerical features labeled as a followed by a number, such as a one, a two, and so on up to a ten. The target variable is labeled as "class". The dataset has been utilized in studies exploring machine learning techniques, particularly those involving instance-based learning and encoding length selection for numeric prediction tasks.

The origins of this dataset are not clearly specified, but it has been referenced in academic literature focusing on machine learning and predictive modeling. Researchers working with this dataset should acknowledge its use in their publications, referencing the work where it was employed for numeric prediction studies.
