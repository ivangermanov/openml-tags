The Meta-Album Plant Document Dataset (Extended) is a collection of images featuring leaves of both healthy and unhealthy plants. These images were sourced from Google Images and Ecosia, then subsequently cropped by the dataset creators to ensure that a single complete leaf occupies each image. While the original uncropped images varied in terms of scale, lighting conditions, and pose, those within the same category often originated from the same initial image.

This dataset consists of twenty-seven distinct classes, encompassing various plant disease names and plant species names, such as Corn Leaf Blight and Cherry Leaf. It was initially developed for a benchmarking classification model study published in twenty-twenty by Singh et al. The Plant Document dataset included in the Meta-Album benchmark is derived from a preprocessed version of the original Plant Document dataset.

To achieve independent and identically distributed samples, one leaf image was randomly selected from each original image. Subsequently, these leaf images were cropped, converted into square shapes, and resized to 128x128 pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
