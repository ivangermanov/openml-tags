The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded according to their characteristics, specifically the degree of colinearity and the number of samples and features.

These datasets are based on the Friedman function, which includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, with a normalized noise added to the output. The Friedman function is a widely used method for generating data, particularly in the field of machine learning.

The original Friedman function has five input features, but additional features were added to measure the effect of unrelated features on the output. Furthermore, the datasets were generated with varying degrees of colinearity to test the robustness of algorithms to correlated features. 

The Friedman datasets were generated with a range of parameters, including the number of features, the number of samples, and the degree of colinearity. The number of features varied from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are actually related to the output. The remaining features are randomly generated and do not affect the output. 

Similarly, the number of samples ranged from one hundred to one thousand. The degree of colinearity also varied, with values ranging from zero to four. This means that in some datasets, up to four features are dependent on other features.

In total, eighty artificial datasets were generated by combining these different parameters. Each dataset has a target variable, which is the last attribute in each file.
