QSAR-TID-12894 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12894. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor One, which is a protein target involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, synaptic transmission, and neurotransmitter receptor activity.

The receptor is a single protein, also known as GPRC One A, GRM One, and MGLUR One, and is primarily found in the nucleus, plasma membrane, and postsynaptic density of neurons.

The dataset is useful for researchers studying the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor One and its role in various biological processes, as well as for those developing new compounds that target this receptor.
