This dataset contains qualitative and quantitative data about projects completed in a consumer electronics company (one row per project). There is a mixture of qualitative attributes (measured on a 5 point ranked scale: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High) and quantitative attributes whose scale is stated.

The data includes information on various aspects of software development projects, such as:

Specification and Documentation: Experience of staff, quality of documentation, regularity of reviews, standard procedures followed, and defects discovered.

Functionality: Complexity and scale of new functionality, total number of inputs and outputs.

Development: Staff experience, programmer capability, defined processes followed, and staff motivation.

Testing: Process definition, staff experience, and quality of documented test cases.

Project Management: Staff training quality, requirements management, project planning, distributed communication, stakeholder involvement, vendor management, internal communication, and process maturity.

Other metrics: Total effort, thousands of lines of code (KLOC), programming language, and testing defects.

Keywords: Software engineering, project data, qualitative factors, defect prediction, consumer electronics, software metrics, development process, testing process, project management.
