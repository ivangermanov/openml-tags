Pulsar Dataset HTRU2 Tags: Pulsar candidates collected during the HTRU survey.

Pulsars are a type of star of considerable scientific interest. Candidates must be classified into pulsar and non-pulsar classes to aid discovery.

The HTRU2 dataset describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter. As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus, pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.

Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation. Thus, a potential signal detection known as a candidate is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional information, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However, in practice, almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.

Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems, in particular, are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. Here, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class.

The dataset contains spurious examples caused by radio frequency interference and noise, and real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. The data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF. Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are zero for negative and one for positive.

Each candidate is described by eight continuous variables and a single class variable. The first four are simple statistics obtained from the integrated pulse profile. This is an array of continuous variables that describe a longitude-resolved version of the signal that has been averaged in both time and frequency. The remaining four variables are similarly obtained from the DM-SNR curve.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of pulsar astronomy.
