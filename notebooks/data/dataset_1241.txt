Normalized Form of Cod RNA Dataset

This dataset belongs to the categories of Chemistry and Life Science.

The source of this dataset is the original website, which provides detailed information about the preprocessing steps.

To create this dataset, the test, train, and rest datasets were joined together. Each file column was normalized according to specific rules. If a column contained only one value, it was considered a constant feature and set to zero, effectively removing it due to sparsity. If a column had two values, it was considered a binary feature, and the more frequently occurring value was set to zero, while the other was set to one. For columns containing more than two values, considered multinary or real features, the column was divided by its standard deviation.

Note that this dataset still contains many duplicate data points within each file and across files, which have not been removed.

Features include various attributes related to Cod RNA.
