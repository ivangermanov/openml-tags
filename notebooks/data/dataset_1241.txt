Name: Codrna Norm
Tags: study

This dataset is a normalized form of Codrna. It originates from the LibSVM website and is related to the detection of non-coding RNAs based on predicted secondary structure formation free energy change. The dataset was created by combining test, train, and rest datasets, then normalizing each file columnwise according to specific rules:

- Constant features (columns with only one value) were set to zero and removed due to sparsity.
- Binary features (columns with two values) had the more frequent value set to zero and the less frequent value set to one.
- Multinary or real features (columns with more than two values) were divided by their standard deviation.

It's important to note that this dataset contains many duplicated data points, both within each file (train, test, rest) and across these files. These duplicated points were not removed during the preprocessing.

The dataset is based on research in bioinformatics, specifically focusing on RNA structure prediction and classification. It has applications in genomics and computational biology, potentially aiding in the identification and characterization of non-coding RNA sequences.

Users of this dataset should be aware of its preprocessing steps and the presence of duplicates when conducting analyses or developing models. The normalization process applied to the features may impact the interpretation of results and should be considered when drawing conclusions from studies using this dataset.
