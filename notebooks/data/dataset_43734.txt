Nashville Housing Data
Tags: Context

This dataset contains home value data for the hot Nashville market. It comprises over fifty-six thousand rows of data, although unfortunately, home detail data is missing for approximately half of the entries. If anyone is interested in tracking down the missing information, they are more than welcome to do so. In the meantime, I will also be searching for the missing data. Enjoy exploring this dataset.

I will be sharing the Python file used to retrieve this data once it has been cleaned up. 

This dataset features a wide range of attributes, including Parcel ID, Land Use, Property Address, Property City, Sale Date, Sale Price, Legal Reference, Sold as Vacant, Multiple Parcels Involved in Sale, Owner Information, Address, City, State, Acreage, Tax District, Neighborhood, Land Value, Building Value, Total Value, Finished Area, Foundation Type, Year Built, Exterior Wall, Grade, Number of Bedrooms, Number of Full Baths, and Number of Half Baths.
