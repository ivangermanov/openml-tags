Anime Dataset Tags: Context

As a fan of anime, Japanese animated media, I have always been passionate about gathering information about all the anime I can get my hands on. Having a comprehensive dataset at my fingertips would allow me to explore and discover new anime, and gain a deeper understanding of the medium as a whole.

Content

This dataset was scraped from Anime-Planet, a website renowned for its clean design and ease of access to relevant information. The data was collected on a specific date, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with such a rich and valuable resource.

Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my gratitude to Anime-Planet for creating a website that is not only user-friendly but also provides a wealth of information about anime. Their dedication to providing a clean and organized platform has made it possible for me to collect and analyze this data.

Inspiration

Using this dataset, I am eager to explore the factors that contribute to the rating of an anime. By analyzing the various attributes of each anime, I hope to uncover patterns and trends that can help explain why certain anime are more highly rated than others. Furthermore, I am excited about the possibility of creating a recommendation engine that can suggest anime to users based on their preferences.

Features

The dataset includes a range of attributes, including the title of the anime, its media type, the number of episodes, duration, and release information. Additionally, the dataset includes a description of the anime, the studios involved in its production, and any relevant tags or content warnings. The dataset also includes information about user engagement, such as the number of users who have watched, are watching, or want to watch the anime, as well as the overall rating and number of votes.
