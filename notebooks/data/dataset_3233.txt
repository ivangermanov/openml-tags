This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase NEK Six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP Six One Two Four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and numerous FCFP Six One Two Four features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version Seventeen.
