The Meta-Album Medicinal Leaf Dataset is a comprehensive collection of thirty species of healthy and mature medicinal herbs. The leaves were plucked from different plants of the same species and then placed on a white uniform background. This dataset contains approximately eighteen hundred images, all captured using a mobile phone camera. The original resolution was sixteen hundred by twelve hundred pixels. However, we resized these images to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels for the Meta-Album.
