KDD Cup Nine Appetency Seed Three Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original KDD Cup Nine Appetency dataset. It was generated using a specific set of parameters, including a random seed of three, a maximum number of two thousand rows, a hundred columns, and ten classes. The sampling was done in a stratified manner to ensure that each class is represented proportionally.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes were identified, and then a random selection of ten classes was made. The instances belonging to these selected classes were retained, while the rest were discarded. Next, the columns were sampled uniformly, selecting a hundred columns randomly from the total. Finally, the instances were sampled again, this time selecting two thousand instances stratified according to their class labels.

The resulting dataset consists of a hundred features, which include variables such as Variance One, Variance Two, and so on up to Variance One Hundred Eighty-Two, and finally, Appetency.
