Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Appetency

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is used to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed value, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, as well as a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling.

The function first selects a subset of classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the data.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed. It does this by randomly selecting a subset of column indices and using these indices to subset the data.

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. This ensures that the class distribution is maintained in the subsampled data.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset object, which includes the subsampled data, as well as metadata such as the categorical mask and column names.
