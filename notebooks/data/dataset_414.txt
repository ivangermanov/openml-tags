This is one of forty-one drug design datasets. The datasets, which consist of one thousand one hundred forty-three features, were formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs were taken from the original studies.

The Lewis dataset was taken exactly from the original study.

Original studies include Carbolenes, MTP Two, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two.

MTP stands for Melting Point, which is a measure of the temperature at which a solid changes state from solid to liquid. It is an important property in chemistry and physics.

Carbolenes are a type of organic compound that has been studied extensively in chemistry. They have unique properties that make them useful in various applications.

The datasets were taken from various sources, including journals and books. These sources include Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Journal of Chemical Information and Computational Science, and European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.

Keywords: drug design, Adriana Code, Carbolenes, MTP, chemistry, medicinal chemistry, computational science.
