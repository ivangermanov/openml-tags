This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target. 

The dataset covers various topics in medicinal chemistry and drug design, including carbolenes, melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), PDGFR inhibitors, toxicology, biodegradability of compounds, structure-function relationships of proteins, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The data comes from numerous published studies in journals such as Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science, Chemosphere, Protein Engineering, and others. The research spans topics like molecular descriptors, artificial neural networks, pharmacological evaluation, molecular modeling, weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors, predictive toxicology, and quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships.

Many of the studies focus on developing models and methods for predicting various properties of chemical compounds, such as melting points, biological activity, toxicity, and biodegradability. These models often employ techniques like QSAR, artificial neural networks, and other statistical and machine learning approaches.

The datasets cover a wide range of chemical compounds, including aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatic compounds, anilines, phenols, and various drug-like molecules. The research aims to understand the relationships between molecular structure and properties, which is crucial for drug design and development.
