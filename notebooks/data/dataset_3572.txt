QSAR-TID-10960 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Delta, and it has seventy rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains information about Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Delta, also known as Nuclear Hormone Receptor One, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group C Member Two. It is a single protein and its preferred name is Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Beta.
