QSAR-TID-10960 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Delta, and it has seventy rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Delta. The Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Delta is a single protein, also known as Nuclear Hormone Receptor One, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group C Member Two, and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Beta. It is a transcription factor, nuclear receptor, and nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group C member two.

The Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Delta is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, placenta development, proteoglycan metabolic process, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, lipid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process, fatty acid beta-oxidation, apoptotic process, cell communication, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, heart development, embryo implantation, cell population proliferation, axon ensheathment, epidermis development, phospholipid biosynthetic process, response to glucose, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, response to organic substance, positive regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of cholesterol storage, phosphatidylinositol three-kinase signaling, positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol three-kinase signaling, response to activity, regulation of skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation, negative regulation of smooth muscle cell migration, fatty acid transport, fatty acid oxidation, cell differentiation, negative regulation of cell growth, intracellular receptor signaling pathway, cell-substrate adhesion, cellular response to nutrient levels, negative regulation of collagen biosynthetic process, response to vitamin A, positive regulation of insulin secretion involved in cellular response to glucose stimulus, wound healing, regulation of cell population proliferation, vasodilation, negative regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of skeletal muscle tissue regeneration, keratinocyte proliferation, regulation of fat cell differentiation, negative regulation of myoblast differentiation, positive regulation of epidermis development, positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription, positive regulation of fatty acid metabolic process, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, positive regulation of fatty acid oxidation, decidualization, regulation of response to stimulus, negative regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, epithelial cell proliferation, regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, negative regulation of inflammatory response, regulation of insulin secretion, keratinocyte migration, cellular response to stimulus, adipose tissue development, fat cell proliferation, positive regulation of fat cell proliferation, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cellular response to hypoxia, energy homeostasis, apoptotic signaling pathway, negative regulation of miRNA transcription, positive regulation of oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler activity, and positive regulation of myoblast proliferation.
