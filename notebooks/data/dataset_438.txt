The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function includes five features for input, which are related to the output. Additional features are added to measure the effects of non-related features, which are independent from the output.

To measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree refers to the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters are varied to test different scenarios. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output, and the rest are completely random. 

Similarly, the number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand. Additionally, the colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target.
