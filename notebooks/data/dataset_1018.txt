The IPUMS-LA-99-Small dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this modified version, the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature, where the majority class is labeled as Positive and all others are labeled as Negative.

This dataset contains various features related to chemistry and life sciences. The features include information about demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and race, as well as socioeconomic factors like education level, employment status, and income. Additionally, there are features related to family structure, migration, and veteran status.

The dataset is useful for researchers studying life sciences and chemistry, particularly those interested in analyzing the relationships between demographic and socioeconomic factors.
