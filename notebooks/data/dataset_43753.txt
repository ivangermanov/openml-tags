Country Socioeconomic Status Scores Part II

This dataset contains estimates of the socioeconomic status position of each of one hundred forty-nine countries covering the period from eighteen eighty to two thousand ten. Measures of socioeconomic status, which are in decades, allow for a one hundred thirty year time-series analysis of the changing position of countries in the global status hierarchy. Socioeconomic status scores are the average of each country's income and education ranking and are reported as percentile rankings ranging from one to ninety-nine. As such, they can be interpreted similarly to other percentile rankings, such as high school standardized test scores. If country A has a socioeconomic status score of fifty-five, for example, it indicates that fifty-five percent of the countries in this dataset have a lower average income and education ranking than country A.

ISO alpha and numeric country codes are included to allow users to merge these data with other variables, such as those found in the World Bank's World Development Indicators Database and the United Nations Common Database. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore how the world came to look the way it does, at least in terms of the status position of countries.

Variable descriptions include the following: unique identifier, World Bank identifier, country socioeconomic status score, country name, survey year, GDP per capita, completed years of education in the adult population, and regional coding schema.

The dataset was compiled from a large number of data sources, including historical statistics on the world economy, the century of education, growth and human capital, and a new dataset of educational attainment in the world.
