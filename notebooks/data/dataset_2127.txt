This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used in any research or publication.

The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are Fixed Count Fingerprint six, also known as FCFP six, which is a type of molecular fingerprint that uses a fixed count of bits to describe the molecular structure. These fingerprints are commonly used in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling.
