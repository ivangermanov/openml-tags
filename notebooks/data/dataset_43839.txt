The Iris Flower Dataset

Tags: Context

The Iris Flower Dataset was used in a classic paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It includes three iris species with samples as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

Content
