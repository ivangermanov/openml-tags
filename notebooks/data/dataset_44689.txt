Name: Wine Quality White Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Wine Quality White with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, arguments ncols max equals one hundred, arguments nclasses max equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the dataset. The function first samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function samples the columns uniformly, selecting a specified number of columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function stratifies the data according to the target variable and samples the data using train test split.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string and returns a new dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and column names.

Features: The dataset contains various features, including V One, V Two, V Three, V Four, V Five, V Six, V Seven, V Eight, V Nine, V Ten, V Eleven, and Class.
