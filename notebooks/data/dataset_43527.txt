Malware Analysis Datasets PE Section Headers

Tags: Introduction

This dataset is part of a PhD research project on malware detection and classification using Deep Learning. It contains static analysis data, specifically PE Section Headers of the text, code, and code sections, extracted from the pe sections elements of Cuckoo Sandbox reports. The dataset includes Portable Executable malware examples downloaded from a reputable online source, as well as PE goodware examples obtained from a trusted portable software website and from Windows directories.

The dataset features the following columns:

Column Name: Hash
Description: The MD5 hash of the example, a unique identifier for each file
Content: A thirty-two character string

Column Name: Size of Data
Description: The size of the section on disk, an important characteristic of the file
Content: An integer value

Column Name: Virtual Address
Description: The memory address of the first byte of the section relative to the image base, a crucial aspect of the file's structure
Content: An integer value

Column Name: Entropy
Description: The calculated entropy of the section, a measure of its randomness and complexity
Content: A floating-point number

Column Name: Virtual Size
Description: The size of the section when loaded into memory, a key feature of the file's behavior
Content: An integer value

Column Name: Malware
Description: The class of the file, either goodware or malware
Content: A binary value, zero for goodware and one for malware
