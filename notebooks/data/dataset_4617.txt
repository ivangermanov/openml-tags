The kr-vs-kp dataset has been subsampled with specific parameters to create a new dataset. This dataset has been generated using a specific source code that employs techniques such as uniform sampling and stratification. The goal of subsampling is to reduce the size of the original dataset while maintaining its essential characteristics.

The subsampling process involves several steps. First, the number of classes is limited to a maximum number. If the original dataset has more classes than this limit, a subset of classes is randomly selected based on their frequency distribution. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a representative distribution of classes.

Next, the number of columns is limited to a maximum number. If the original dataset has more columns than this limit, a subset of columns is randomly selected. The selection is done uniformly, without any bias towards specific columns.

Finally, the number of rows is limited to a maximum number. If the original dataset has more rows than this limit, a subset of rows is selected using stratified sampling. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a representative distribution of classes.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of features, including King Blocker Blocked, Blocker Not Yet Blocked, Blocker On Eighth Rank, Blocker On A File, Blocker Springs, King X Blocker Queen, King X Checked Rank, King X Weak Pawn, Black Locked Pawn, Black Pawn On Queen Square, Context, Doubled Pawns Opposite, Doubled Pawns Isolated, and others.
