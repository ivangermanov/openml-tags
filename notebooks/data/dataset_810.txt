The PBC dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. This conversion process involves taking the numeric target feature and transforming it into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean value is calculated, and then all instances with a lower target value are classified as positive, denoted by 'P', while all other instances are classified as negative, denoted by 'N'.

This dataset is characterized by several features, including those related to chemistry and life sciences. The PBC dataset is particularly useful for myth-busting and studying various concepts related to these fields.

Features include properties such as those denoted by Z1 through Z17, which are used in conjunction with the binary class feature to analyze and understand various phenomena.
