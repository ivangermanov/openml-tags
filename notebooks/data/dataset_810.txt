The binarized version of the original dataset has been created by converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This has been achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

Features included in this dataset are words commonly found in written language, including articles, conjunctions, prepositions, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. These features provide insight into the writing style and structure of texts.
