This dataset contains instances concerning the frequencies of seven types of algae populations in different environments. 

Features: 

The dataset contains seventeen values for each instance. The first eleven values represent the season, river size, fluid velocity, and eight chemical concentrations relevant to the algae population distribution. 

Scraped Data: 
Dataset Information 

Additional Information 
This data originates from a water quality study where samples were taken from various sites on European rivers over a period of approximately one year. These samples were analyzed for several chemical substances, including nitrogen in the forms of nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia, phosphate, pH, oxygen, and chloride. In parallel, algae samples were collected to determine the algae population distributions.

The competition involves predicting algal frequency distributions based on the measured concentrations of the chemical substances and the global information regarding the season when the sample was taken, the river size, and its flow velocity. 

There are no missing values in this dataset.

Additional Variable Information 
Each example consists of seventeen values. The first eleven values of each dataset represent the season, river size, fluid velocity, and eight chemical concentrations relevant to the algae population distribution. The remaining six values of each example are the distribution of different kinds of algae. These six kinds are only a small part of the entire community, but for the competition, the number was limited to seven. The value zero point zero indicates that the frequency is very low. The dataset also contains some empty fields labeled with the string unknown.
