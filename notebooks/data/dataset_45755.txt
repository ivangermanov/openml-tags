Algae Dataset

This dataset contains instances concerning the frequencies of seven types of algae populations in different environments. The dataset features a range of chemical concentrations and river characteristics that are relevant for the algae population distribution.

The dataset comes from a water quality study where samples were taken from sites on different European rivers over a period of approximately one year. These samples were analyzed for various chemical substances, including nitrogen in the form of nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia, phosphate, pH, oxygen, and chloride. In parallel, algae samples were collected to determine the algae population distributions.

The competition involved the prediction of algal frequency distributions on the basis of the measured concentrations of the chemical substances and the global information concerning the season when the sample was taken, the river size, and its flow velocity.

The dataset contains a total of instances, each containing seventeen values. The first eleven values of each dataset are the season, the river size, the fluid velocity, and eight chemical concentrations. The last eight values of each example are the distribution of different kinds of algae. These eight kinds are only a very small part of the whole community, but for the competition, we limited the number to seven. The value zero point zero means that the frequency is very low.

The dataset does not contain any missing values. The training data are saved in an ASCII format file.
