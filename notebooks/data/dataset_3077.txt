QSAR-TID-11453 Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study 3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11453. It has fifty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited when used.

This dataset is related to Xaa-Pro dipeptidase, also known as Imidodipeptidase, PEPD, Peptidase D, PRD, and Prolidase. It is an enzyme belonging to the metalloprotease family, specifically the Metallo protease M24B subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, amino acid metabolism, collagen catabolic process, and negative regulation of programmed cell death.
