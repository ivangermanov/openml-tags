QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

Source: MetaQSAR project - September

Please cite: This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP, and many more molecular fingerprint features.
