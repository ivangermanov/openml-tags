This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset includes features such as Vote, Tax Rate, Budget, Budget Change, and Tax Rate Change, which are used to classify instances into Positive or Negative classes.
