Subsampling of the dataset Gina with Seed equals Three 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Gina dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The goal is to create a smaller dataset that retains the essential characteristics of the original dataset.

The subsampling process starts by selecting a specified number of unique classes from the original dataset. In this case, the maximum number of classes is set to Ten. A uniform sampling strategy is employed to select the desired number of classes, taking into account the class distribution in the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset are uniformly sampled. The maximum number of columns is set to One Hundred. A uniform sampling strategy is used again to select the desired number of columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset are uniformly sampled. The maximum number of rows is set to Two Thousand. To ensure that the resulting dataset is representative of the original dataset, a stratified sampling strategy is employed. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets using a stratified approach, which helps maintain the class balance in the resulting dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features, which include V Two, V Five, V Twenty Nine, and so on.
