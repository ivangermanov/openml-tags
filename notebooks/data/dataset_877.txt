Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

The dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the original target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value falls below or above this mean threshold.

The binary classification is represented using the labels 'P' for positive instances and 'N' for negative instances. This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques to the dataset.

The original source and date of creation for this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper data provenance and documentation in research and data science projects.
