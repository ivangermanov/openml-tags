Timing Attack Dataset: Twenty Micro Seconds Delay Created on September Twentieth, Two Thousand Twenty-Two

Tags: Bleichenbacher Timing Attack

This dataset contains features extracted from network traffic related to the Bleichenbacher timing attack. The attack is a type of side-channel attack that targets the RSA decryption process.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset includes attributes related to the Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect messages. These attributes describe various aspects of the TCP and TLS protocols, such as source and destination ports, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, window sizes, and flags.

The Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and flags. The flags include reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN-echo, urgent, acknowledgment, push, reset, syn, and fin.

The TLS Alert attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and flags. The flags include reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN-echo, urgent, acknowledgment, push, reset, syn, and fin. Additionally, the TLS Alert attributes include the record content type, record length, alert message level, and alert message description.

The TCP Disconnect attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and flags. The flags include reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN-echo, urgent, acknowledgment, push, reset, syn, and fin.
