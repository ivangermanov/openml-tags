**QSAR-TID-101030**
**Tags:** Government, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101030. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has one hundred three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-six more features representing FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
