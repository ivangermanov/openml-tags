Name: sf-police-incidents Seed One N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset sf-police-incidents with seed equal to one, arguments n rows max equal to two thousand, arguments n columns max equal to one hundred, arguments n classes max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in self, seed, n rows max, n columns max, n classes max, and stratified as parameters. It uses numpy's random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects the features x and target y from the dataset. If the number of unique classes in the target is greater than n classes max, it selects n classes max classes using random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the features and target accordingly. If the number of columns in the features is greater than n columns max, it uniformly samples n columns max columns. If the number of rows in the features is greater than n rows max, it uses train test split with stratification based on the target to select n rows max rows. Finally, it returns a dataset with the selected features, target, and categorical mask.

Features: Hour of the Day, Day of the Week, Month of the Year, Year, Police District, Address, X Coordinate, Y Coordinate, Violent Crime
