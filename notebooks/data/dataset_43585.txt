Clash Royale Ladder Battles dataset

I expect to update this dataset daily and encourage you to make an Exploratory Data Analysis or even train a model to predict if I win or lose!

Notes: "Opponent" means the player I am competing against in a match.

My Troops, Opponent Troops, My Buildings, Opponent Buildings, My Spells, Opponent Spells, My Commons, Opponent Commons, My Rares, Opponent Rares, My Epics, Opponent Epics, My Legendaries, Opponent Legendaries: The number of cards of that type in my deck and my opponent's deck.

My Name of Card, Opponent Name of Card: The level of that card. If zero, then that card was not used in that battle.

This is my second Clash Royale account, and I only play one-versus-one ladder matches, not two-versus-two matches.
