Census of India is a rich database that tells the stories of over a billion Indians. It is essential not only for research purposes but also commercially for organizations that want to understand India's complex yet strongly knit heterogeneity.

However, there does not exist a single database on the web that combines district-wise information of all the variables (most include no more than four to five out of over fifty variables!). Extracting and using data from the Census of India 2001 is quite a laborious task since all data is made available in scattered PDFs district-wise. Individual PDFs can be extracted from the official website.

This database has been extracted from the Census of 2001 and includes data of 590 districts, having around eighty variables each. In case of confusion regarding the context of the variable, refer to the PDF datasheet, which provides clear explanations.

The dataset contains various demographic and socioeconomic variables, including population growth, rural and urban populations, scheduled castes and tribes, literacy rates, education levels, workforce participation, religion, and access to amenities like drinking water, electricity, healthcare, schools, and transportation.
