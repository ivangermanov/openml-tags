QSAR-TID-119 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 119. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

The Calcitonin Receptor is a single protein, also known as Calcitonin Receptor CALCR CT-R, and is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family B G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor. It is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as a protein target.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including ossification, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, protein kinase A signaling, and peptidyl-serine phosphorylation.

The receptor has been shown to interact with various ligands, including calcitonin, amylin, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. It has been implicated in various diseases, including osteoporosis, and has been the target of various therapeutic agents.
