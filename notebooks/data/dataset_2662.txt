This dataset contains historical price data of the FOREX EUR/SGD exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one minute of trading activity, and the entire dataset spans from January to December.

The dataset excludes weekends, as FOREX markets are closed during these periods. All timestamps are represented in the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price between the current and subsequent minutes. A value of true denotes an increase in the mean high price, while false indicates a decrease or stagnation.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading strategies, which require predicting close prices.
