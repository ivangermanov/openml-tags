QSAR-TID-11298 Dataset: MetaQSAR Project 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11298. It has sixty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to education and statistics, specifically focusing on machine learning QSAR models for predicting biological activities of molecules.

The features of this dataset include molecule chembl id and molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive platform for QSAR modeling.
