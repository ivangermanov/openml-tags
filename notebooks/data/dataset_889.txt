Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers. These features are not easily human-readable and have been omitted. The final feature is binaryClass.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been converted into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the original target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value fell below or above this mean threshold. This binarization technique allows for the application of classification algorithms to what may have originally been a regression task.

The source and date of the dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper documentation and attribution in data science. Researchers and practitioners using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work.

The presence of multiple study-related tags suggests that this dataset may have been used across various research projects or academic studies. The mythbusting tag implies that the data might be related to testing or debunking certain hypotheses or commonly held beliefs.
