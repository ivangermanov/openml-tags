Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original census-related dataset. The primary modification involves the transformation of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization process simplifies the original multi-class or continuous target variable into a more straightforward two-class problem, which can be useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks.

The dataset includes several features, though their specific names are not provided in a human-readable format. These features likely represent various demographic, economic, or social characteristics typically found in census data. The binary classification serves as the target variable for potential predictive modeling or statistical analysis.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The original source and date of the dataset are unknown, which may be important to consider when evaluating the currency and context of the data.
