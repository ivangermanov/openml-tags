Please cite: This is an artificial dataset where instances belong to several clusters with a banana shape. There are two attributes, At1 and At2, corresponding to the x and y axes, respectively. The class label (negative one and one) represents one of the two banana shapes in the dataset.

This dataset was created for studying clustering algorithms and classification problems involving non-linear decision boundaries. The banana-shaped clusters present a unique challenge for machine learning models, as they are not easily separable by linear classifiers. Researchers can use this dataset to evaluate the performance of various algorithms in handling complex, curved decision boundaries.

The two main features, At1 and At2, provide the coordinates for each data point in a two-dimensional space. These coordinates form the characteristic banana shapes when plotted. The class label distinguishes between the two intertwined banana-shaped clusters, allowing for binary classification tasks.
