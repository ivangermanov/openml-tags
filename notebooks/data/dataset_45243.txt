Pathfinder Bayesian Network Sample Two. 

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online. 

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex model. 

The average Markov blanket size and average degree indicate the network's density and interconnectedness. 

Maximum in-degree is also an important characteristic of this network.

This Bayesian network was part of the Pathfinder Project, which aimed to create normative expert systems. 

The project's goal was to develop a system that could reason about uncertainty and probability.

The Pathfinder Bayesian Network is a discrete very large Bayesian network.
