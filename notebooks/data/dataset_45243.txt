Pathfinder Bayesian Network. Sample Two.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are indicators of the network's complexity.

The Pathfinder Project was a groundbreaking research effort that aimed to create normative expert systems. The project's goal was to develop a system that could reason and make decisions like a human expert.

The network features a wide range of variables, including Fault, and many others.
