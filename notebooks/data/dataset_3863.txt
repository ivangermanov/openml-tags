QSAR-TID-238 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Stem Cell Growth Factor Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Stem Cell Growth Factor Receptor, which is a single protein and a preferred name for CD117, KIT, Mast/Stem Cell Growth Factor Receptor, Kit p145, c-kit, and PBT. The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification.

The dataset has features that represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information on compounds, including FORETINIB, ANLOTINIB, MASITINIB, XL-999, and PAZOPANIB, which are small molecules that inhibit Stem Cell Growth Factor Receptor. These compounds have different mechanisms of action and have been in different phases of development.

The dataset also contains information on the biological process of Stem Cell Growth Factor Receptor, including its role in ovarian follicle development, hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, myeloid progenitor cell differentiation, lymphoid progenitor cell differentiation, and immature B cell differentiation. It also plays a role in mast cell chemotaxis, positive regulation of dendritic cell cytokine production, protein phosphorylation, and inflammatory response.
