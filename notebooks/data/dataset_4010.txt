QSAR-TID-10426 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor Two, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
