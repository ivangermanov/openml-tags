Demographics, MTL QSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor Two, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor Two.
