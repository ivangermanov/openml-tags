This dataset contains the final scores of students at the end of a math program with several features that might or might not impact the future outcome of these students.

The dataset includes attributes for both the math course and Portuguese language course, which are as follows:

The student's school is represented by a binary attribute indicating whether they attend Gabriel Pereira or Mousinho da Silveira.

The student's sex is also a binary attribute, indicating whether they are female or male.

Their age is represented numerically, ranging from fifteen to twenty-two years old.

Their home address type is indicated by a binary attribute, specifying whether it is urban or rural.

Family size is categorized into two groups: less than or equal to three, or greater than three.

Parental cohabitation status is indicated by a binary attribute, specifying whether they live together or apart.

Mother's education level is represented numerically, ranging from zero (no education) to four (higher education).

Father's education level is also represented numerically, following the same scale as mother's education.

Mother's job is categorized nominally, including teacher, healthcare-related, civil services, athome, or other occupations.

Father's job is similarly categorized nominally, following the same occupations as mother's job.

The reason for choosing this school is categorized nominally, including proximity to home, school reputation, course preference, or other reasons.

Student guardianship is categorized nominally, specifying whether it is the mother, father, or another person.

Travel time from home to school is represented numerically, ranging from one to sixty minutes.

Weekly study time is also represented numerically, ranging from one to ten hours.

Number of past class failures is represented numerically.

Extra educational support is indicated by a binary attribute, specifying whether it is received or not.

Family educational support is similarly indicated by a binary attribute.

Extra paid classes within the course subject are indicated by a binary attribute.

Participation in extracurricular activities is also indicated by a binary attribute.

Attendance at nursery school is indicated by a binary attribute.

Desire to pursue higher education is indicated by a binary attribute.

Internet access at home is indicated by a binary attribute.

Romantic relationships are indicated by a binary attribute.

Quality of family relationships is represented numerically, ranging from one (very bad) to five (excellent).

Free time after school is represented numerically, ranging from one (very low) to five (very high).

Going out with friends is represented numerically, ranging from one (very low) to five (very high).

Workday alcohol consumption is represented numerically, ranging from one (very low) to five (very high).

Weekend alcohol consumption is similarly represented numerically.

Current health status is represented numerically, ranging from one (very bad) to five (very good).

Number of school absences is represented numerically, ranging from zero to ninety-three.

Grades related to the math course include first period grade, second period grade, and final grade, all represented numerically and ranging from zero to twenty.
