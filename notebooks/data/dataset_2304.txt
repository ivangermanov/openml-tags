QSAR-TID-100410 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100410. It has 625 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015.

The compound activity values are measured in terms of pseudo-pCI50, which is a unit used to quantify the potency of a compound.

The dataset includes information about the target protein, Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO, also known as AXL. This protein is a single protein preferred name and belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens. It is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase Axl family.

The protein has various synonyms, including AXL oncogene and UFO. It is involved in various biological processes, including neuron migration, natural killer cell differentiation, blood vessel remodeling, and inflammatory response.

The dataset provides information about the expression of the protein in different tissues, including expression in the brain, liver, and lung. It also includes information about the protein's function, including its role in signal transduction, cell migration, and apoptosis.

The dataset is related to other proteins, including CRBN and Tel, which are involved in protein-protein interactions.

Some compounds that interact with the target protein include Bemcentinib, Ningetinib, Enapotamab Vedotin, Gilteritinib, and BP-I9016. These compounds have been shown to inhibit the activity of the protein and may be potential therapeutic agents for treating diseases related to the protein's function.
