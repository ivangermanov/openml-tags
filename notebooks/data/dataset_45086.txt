**Central Nervous System (CNS, Embryonal-T) dataset**

This dataset is a microarray dataset that focuses on the Central Nervous System, specifically on embryonal tumors. The dataset is designed to predict the outcome of these tumors based on gene expression.

The dataset features a wide range of genes, including those related to biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. These genes are represented by their corresponding probe sets, which are used to measure their expression levels.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying the Central Nervous System and embryonal tumors, as it provides a comprehensive view of the genes involved in these processes.
