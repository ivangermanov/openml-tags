The Central Nervous System (CNS) Embryonal Tumour dataset is a collection of gene expression data related to geography and microarray analysis.

This dataset aims to predict the outcome of central nervous system embryonal tumors based on gene expression. The study focuses on understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying these tumors to improve diagnosis and treatment.

The dataset features a comprehensive list of genes, including those related to housekeeping genes, control genes, and other genes involved in various biological processes.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying central nervous system embryonal tumors, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these diseases.
