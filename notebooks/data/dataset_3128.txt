QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Endothelin receptor ET A, also known as Ednra, Endothelin receptor type A, ET AR, and other synonyms. This single protein target is found in Mus musculus and belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the peptide receptor subgroup and short peptide receptor subgroup within the endothelin receptor classification.

The target is associated with various cellular components, including the plasma membrane, T tubule, nuclear membrane, and cell periphery. Its functions encompass protein tyrosine kinase activity, G protein coupled receptor activity, endothelin receptor activity, and protein binding. The target is involved in numerous biological processes, such as mitotic cell cycle, angiogenesis, blood vessel morphogenesis, response to hypoxia, embryonic development, histamine secretion, protein phosphorylation regulation, blood vessel remodeling, cardiac muscle tissue development, and many more.

The Endothelin receptor ET A plays crucial roles in signal transduction pathways, including G protein coupled receptor signaling, adenylate cyclase inhibiting signaling, cytosolic calcium ion concentration regulation, protein kinase C activation, and I kappaB kinase/NF kappaB signaling. It is also implicated in heart development, blood circulation, blood pressure regulation, cell proliferation, wound response, and various developmental processes affecting the neural crest, thyroid gland, and skeletal system.

This target is involved in multiple cellular responses, including oxidative stress, mechanical stimuli, and various hormone stimuli. It participates in important physiological processes such as vasoconstriction, norepinephrine metabolism, and regulation of apoptosis. The Endothelin receptor ET A is also associated with several developmental processes, including pigmentation, enteric nervous system development, and cranial skeletal system development.
