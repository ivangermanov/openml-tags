Data Description 
Synchronous motors are alternating current motors with a constant speed. The synchronous machine data was obtained in real time from an experimental operating environment. The task is to estimate the excitation current of these synchronous motors.

Attribute Description
The first four features are synchronous motor parameters. These include the Load Current, Power Factor, Power Factor Error, and Changing of Excitation. The fifth feature is the Excitation Current, which is the target feature we aim to predict.

Features: Load Current, Power Factor, Power Factor Error, Changing of Excitation, Excitation Current 

Scraped Data: Dataset Information
Additional Information 
The synchronous machine data was obtained in real time from an experimental operating environment. This dataset does not have any missing values.
