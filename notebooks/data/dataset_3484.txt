QSAR-TID-12131 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12131. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Renin protein, which is a single protein target with the preferred name Angiotensinogenase. It is also known as Ren or Ren one and is classified as an enzyme, protease, aspartic protease, aspartic protease AA clan, and aspartic protease A one A subfamily.

The Renin protein is involved in various biological processes, including kidney development, mesonephros development, angiotensin maturation, regulation of blood volume by renin-angiotensin, and renin-angiotensin regulation of aldosterone production. It is also involved in proteolysis, establishment of blood-nerve barrier, regulation of blood pressure, and response to xenobiotic stimulus.
