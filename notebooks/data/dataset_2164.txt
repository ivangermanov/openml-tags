This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID is one of the features in this dataset. There are numerous other features, but they are not easily readable by humans.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was created in September 2015.

This dataset is related to a single protein, specifically the testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase one. This protein is also known by several synonyms, including serine/threonine-protein kinase twenty-two A, SPOGA one, and SPOGA four.

The organism associated with this protein is Homo sapiens. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase TSSK family.

There are several descriptions and relationships associated with this protein, including its expression atlas, component ontology, function ontology, process ontology, and various other cross-references.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR, testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase, Homo sapiens.
