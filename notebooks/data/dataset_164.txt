E. coli Promoter Gene Sequences (DNA)

This dataset is a compilation of promoters with known transcriptional start points for Escherichia coli genes. The primary objective is to recognize promoters in strings that represent nucleotides (either A, G, T, or C). A promoter is a genetic region that initiates the first step in the expression of an adjacent gene, known as transcription. The input features consist of 57 sequential DNA nucleotides.

The dataset comprises 53 sample promoters and 53 nonpromoter sequences. The sample promoters were obtained from a compilation produced in 1983. Negative training examples were derived by selecting contiguous substrings from a 1.5 kilobase sequence provided by a professor from the University of Wisconsin's Chemistry Department. This sequence is a fragment from E. coli bacteriophage T7 isolated with the restriction enzyme HaeIII. It is believed to not contain any promoter sites due to the fact that the fragment does not bind RNA polymerase.

This dataset was developed to help evaluate a "hybrid" learning algorithm called KBANN (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.

Attribute Description:
- The first attribute indicates the class ("+" for promoter, "-" for nonpromoter).
- The second attribute is the instance name (nonpromoters are named by position in the 1500-long nucleotide sequence).
- The remaining 57 attributes represent the sequence, starting at position -50 and ending at position +7. Each of these fields contains one of the nucleotides: a, g, t, or c.

Features: class, instance, and 57 positions representing the DNA sequence from p-50 to p7.
