Subsampling of the dataset Airlines with a specified seed value generates a new dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The goal is to create a new dataset with a reduced number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the overall characteristics of the original dataset.

The process starts by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed number, a random selection of classes is made based on their frequency in the dataset. The corresponding indices where these classes are present are then selected.

Next, the columns of the dataset are uniformly sampled if necessary. A specified maximum number of columns is set, and if the original dataset has more columns than this limit, a random selection of columns is made. The resulting dataset consists of only the selected columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset are uniformly sampled if necessary. A specified maximum number of rows is set, and if the resulting dataset has more rows than this limit, a stratified sampling approach is used to select the required number of rows. This ensures that the class distribution in the original dataset is maintained in the new dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected rows, columns, and classes from the original dataset. The categorical columns are converted to strings to facilitate further processing.
