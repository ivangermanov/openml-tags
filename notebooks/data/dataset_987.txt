This dataset, known as Collins, is associated with mythbusting and study tags. It represents a binarized version of an original dataset, where the multi-class target feature has been transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by re-labeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all other classes as negative ('N'). The dataset includes various features related to text analysis, cognitive processes, social interactions, and temporal aspects. These features provide insights into different dimensions of the analyzed content, such as personal perspective, thought patterns, reasoning, social connections, and event descriptions. The dataset's structure allows for binary classification tasks and can be utilized for various analytical purposes in fields such as natural language processing, cognitive science, and social studies.
