This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: nineteen thousand six hundred thirty-nine, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Interleukin one receptor associated kinase four.

Interleukin one receptor associated kinase four is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms include Interleukin one receptor associated kinase four IRAK four IRAK dash four renal carcinoma antigen NY dash REN dash sixty-four. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and its classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase TKL protein kinase group TKL protein kinase IRAK family.

The description of this protein is that it is involved in various biological processes including toll-like receptor signaling pathway, immune system process, neutrophil mediated immunity, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. It also plays a role in various molecular functions including nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, and interleukin-one receptor binding.

This protein is also involved in various cellular components including extracellular space, nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and endosome membrane. Its expression atlas includes various expression profiles and it has been linked to various diseases including IRAK four deficiency and invasive pneumococcal disease.
