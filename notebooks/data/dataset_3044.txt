QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Alpha a adrenergic receptor, also known as Adra1a, Adra1c, Alpha A adrenergic receptor, Alpha A adrenoceptor, and Alpha A adrenoreceptor. This receptor is found in Rattus norvegicus and belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor subfamily of monoamine receptors in the adrenergic receptor category.

The Alpha a adrenergic receptor is involved in numerous biological processes, including MAPK cascade regulation, heart rate control, blood pressure regulation, muscle contraction, signal transduction, and cellular responses to various stimuli. It plays roles in organ growth, cardiac muscle development, and synaptic transmission modulation.

This receptor is found in various cellular components, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, caveolae, T tubules, and synapses. Its functions encompass G protein coupled receptor activity, adrenergic receptor activity, and protein heterodimerization.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is intended for use in quantitative structure activity relationship studies. It provides valuable information for researchers investigating drug interactions with the Alpha a adrenergic receptor and related targets.
