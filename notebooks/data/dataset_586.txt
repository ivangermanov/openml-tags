The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

These datasets are named according to their characteristics, specifically their colinearity degree and sample number, followed by their feature number. 

The Friedman function is a widely used method for generating data, as it includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs, with a normalized noise added to the output. 

This function takes into account five features for input, which are then expanded upon to test the effects of unrelated features and colinearity. 

To achieve this, additional features are added to the datasets, which are independent of the output, while also varying the colinearity degree to assess an algorithm's robustness.

Colinearity degree refers to the number of features dependent on other features, which ranges from zero to four in these datasets.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in their parameters, including the number of features, ranging from five to one hundred, although only the first five features relate to the output, while the rest are randomly generated.

Similarly, the number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand, providing a diverse range of scenarios for testing.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

Each dataset has a target attribute, serving as the output variable.
