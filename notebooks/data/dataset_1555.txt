QSAR-TID-11691 Tags: Astronomy, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BLK, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identifiers and multiple molecular fingerprints.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. 

This dataset contains information about Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BLK, also known as B Lymphocyte Kinase or P55-BLK, which is a single protein preferred name and belongs to the species group Homo sapiens. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and TK protein kinase group, specifically a tyrosine protein kinase Src family.

Description, Relationship, Accession, and Target Classification are also provided for this protein. 

Additionally, there is information about the expression atlas, gene ontology components, gene functions, and biological processes related to this protein.
