Dataset Title: AutoUniv Dataset data problem: autoUniv

Abstract: AutoUniv is an advanced data generator for classifications tasks. The aim is to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. Data can be generated in CSV, ARFF or C formats.

Source: AutoUniv was developed by a researcher. Email contact is provided on the AutoUniv website.

Data Set Information: The user first creates a classification model and then generates classified examples from it. To create a model, the following are specified: the number of attributes (up to a large number) and their type (discrete or continuous), the number of classes (up to several), the complexity of the underlying rules and the noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomised search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have up to several thousand rules. Rare class models can be designed. A sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. AutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples; a user-friendly statement of the classification rules in an 'if ... then' format; a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate.

Attribute Information: Attributes may be discrete with up to several values or continuous. A discrete attribute can be nominal with values or integer with values.

Relevant Papers: Several papers are cited discussing modeling example life-cycles in online classification learners, the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift, and structure and majority classes in decision tree learning.

Features: The dataset includes numerous features labeled as V followed by numbers, as well as a Class feature.
