Pol is a dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, specifically in the classification on numerical features category. This dataset has undergone transformation in the same manner as other datasets in the benchmark.

The Pol dataset originates from a commercial telecommunications application, as described in an academic paper. Unfortunately, no further information about this application is available.

In terms of characteristics, Pol consists of over fifteen thousand cases, each featuring forty-nine continuous attributes. These attributes were compiled by a researcher specializing in regression datasets.
