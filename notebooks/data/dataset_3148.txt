This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset provides information about the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha, a nuclear receptor subfamily two group B member one, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member One, Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-Alpha, Retinoid X Receptor Alpha, Rxra. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified under the category of Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member One.

The dataset includes various features such as molecular fingerprints, IDs, and class features. These features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The Retinoid X Receptor Alpha is involved in various biological processes including negative regulation of transcription by RNA Polymerase Two, liver development, heart development, and response to nutrient. It also plays a role in regulating gene expression, particularly during embryonic development and cell differentiation.
