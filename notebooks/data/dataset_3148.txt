QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo-pCI units) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features, including molecule IDs and median activity values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation.

The dataset describes the Retinoid X receptor alpha protein target, also known as Nuclear receptor subfamily group B member, Retinoic acid receptor RXR-alpha, and Rxra. It is classified as a transcription factor and nuclear hormone receptor. The protein is found in chromatin, the nucleus, transcription regulator complexes, cytoplasm, mitochondria, axons, and receptor complexes.

Its functions include binding to DNA, RNA polymerase II, retinoic acid, zinc ions, and other nuclear receptors. It is involved in regulating transcription, embryonic development, liver development, heart development, cell differentiation, and various signaling pathways including retinoic acid, vitamin D, and hormone-mediated signaling.

The protein plays roles in processes such as placenta development, axon regeneration, eye development, apoptosis regulation, and cardiac muscle development. It responds to stimuli including nutrients, organic compounds, insulin, vitamins A and D, and glucocorticoids.

This data is part of the MetaQSAR project and is sourced from ChEMBL. Proper citation is requested when using this dataset.
