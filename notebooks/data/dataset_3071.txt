The QSAR-TID-100975 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100975. It has seventy-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The data was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains information on the activity values of various compounds against the drug target TID: 100975.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID, median PXc50, and fingerprint features generated using the FCFP six algorithm. These features are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds and their potential interactions with the drug target.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. This makes the dataset suitable for QSAR modeling and other machine learning applications.

The drug target TID: 100975 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase SRPK three, also known as muscle-specific serine kinase one. It belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and is involved in various biological processes, including spliceosomal complex assembly, protein phosphorylation, and muscle tissue development.
