KC3 Software defect prediction

This dataset is part of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. The specific type of software is unknown. Data is derived from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in an attempt to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes various metrics such as lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, design complexity, Halstead metrics (volume, program length, difficulty, intelligence, effort, time estimator), counts of unique operators and operands, total operators and operands, branch count, and a binary indicator of whether the module has reported defects.

The features are derived from McCabe's line count of code, cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, design complexity, and various Halstead metrics. These include measures of total operators and operands, volume, program length, difficulty, intelligence, effort, time estimation, and line counts for code, comments, and blank lines. Additional metrics cover unique and total operators and operands, as well as branch count in the flow graph.

The dataset is relevant for software engineering research, particularly in the areas of defect prediction and software quality assessment. It provides objective measurements of code characteristics that can be used to analyze and predict software defects.

Relevant papers discuss the quality of NASA software defect datasets, blind spot sampling policies in software engineering, and the assessment of software defect predictors. These studies contribute to the broader field of predictive software models and high assurance software engineering.

The dataset includes a comprehensive set of software metrics that can be used for various analyses in software engineering research. These metrics provide insights into code complexity, structure, and potential areas for improvement in software development processes.
