Pathfinder Bayesian Network Sample Eight is a discrete very large Bayesian network repository referenced in bnlearn. This Bayesian network has a total of nodes and arcs, with a substantial number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree indicate a moderate level of complexity.

The Pathfinder Bayesian Network was designed to facilitate normative expert systems, particularly in the realm of manufacturing. It is a prime example of a Bayesian network applied to a real-world problem domain.

Features of this network include various faults and variables related to manufacturing processes.
