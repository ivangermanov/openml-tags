This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex Canadian Dollar/Japanese Yen currency pair. Each instance represents one hour-long candlestick period. The data ranges from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is closed during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent hour compared to the current hour. Specifically, it is true if the mean high price increases in the following hour and false if it decreases or remains the same.

Please note that this task is hypothetical and intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should focus on predicting close prices, which are also available in the dataset.
