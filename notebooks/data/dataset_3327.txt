QSAR-TID-101021 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101021. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor One Receptor. This receptor is a single protein, also known as CD one fifteen, CSF one R, CSF one-R, and CSF one receptor. It is an enzyme, a kinase, a protein kinase, and a tyrosine protein kinase, belonging to the PDGFR family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including microglial cell activation, neutrophil homeostasis, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, immune system process, response to ischemia, protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, axon guidance, cell population proliferation, and positive regulation of cell population proliferation.

The receptor is also involved in various cellular components, including nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, perikaryon, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, receptor complex, and cell body. It is also involved in various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, growth factor binding, protein phosphatase binding, cytokine binding, and organic cyclic compound binding.
