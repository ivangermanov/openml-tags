U S Pollution Data 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Context 
This dataset deals with pollution in the United States. Pollution in the United States has been well documented by the Environmental Protection Agency, but it is a pain to download all the data and arrange them in a format that interests data scientists. Hence, I gathered four major pollutants – nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone – for every day from two thousand to two thousand sixteen and placed them neatly in a comma-separated values file.

Content 
There is a total of twenty-eight fields. The four pollutants – nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone – each have five specific columns. 
For observations on specific columns, visit the column metadata on the data tab.

Acknowledgments 
All the data is scraped from the database of the Environmental Protection Agency: https://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html

Inspiration 
I did a related project with some of my friends in college, and decided to open-source our dataset so that data scientists do not need to re-scrape the Environmental Protection Agency site for historical pollution data.
