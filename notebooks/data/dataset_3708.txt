This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12919.

Features:

* MOLECULE CHEMEBL ID
* Molecular Fingerprints (FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit)

The molecular fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
