This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101278, is tagged with Government, MTLQSAR, study_3, and Transportation. It originates from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101278. There are seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule, while the median pXC50 represents the potency of each compound. The remaining features are molecular fingerprints, which describe the structure of each molecule.

The dataset is related to the serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO three, also known as RIO kinase three or atypical protein kinase RIO three. This enzyme belongs to the atypical protein kinase RIO family and is involved in various biological processes, including cell signaling, protein phosphorylation, and ribosome biogenesis.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, serine/threonine-protein kinase, RIO kinase, atypical protein kinase, biological processes.
