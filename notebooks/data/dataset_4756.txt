Porto Seguro Seed One Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Strategically Sampled

Tags: Subsampling of the Porto Seguro dataset with seed equal to one, two thousand rows maximum, one hundred columns maximum, ten classes maximum, and stratification set to true.

Generated with the following source code:

This function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that has been strategically sampled. The sampling process involves selecting a specified number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the balance of classes throughout the process.

The function begins by uniformly sampling classes from the target variable. If there are more classes than the specified maximum, it selects the top classes based on their frequency. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If there are more columns than the specified maximum, it randomly selects the specified number of columns while ensuring that the column order is maintained.

Finally, it strategically samples rows using stratified splitting to maintain class balance. The resulting dataset has the specified number of rows, columns, and classes, and it is returned along with its metadata.
