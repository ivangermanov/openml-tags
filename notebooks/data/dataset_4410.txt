The dataset, named Eye Movements, has been subsampled with specific parameters. The subsampling process involved selecting a specified number of rows, columns, and classes from the original dataset while maintaining the original characteristics.

Tags associated with this dataset include Agriculture and Manufacturing.

This subsampled dataset has been generated using a specific source code, which involves several steps. First, the unique classes in the dataset were identified, and then a specified number of classes were randomly selected based on their frequency of occurrence. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were used to filter the data, reducing the number of samples.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality. If the number of columns exceeded a specified maximum, a random selection of columns was made.

Finally, the number of rows was reduced by uniformly sampling the data while maintaining the class distribution. This was achieved through stratified sampling, ensuring that the resulting dataset retains the characteristics of the original dataset.

Features included in this subsampled dataset are:

Line Number, Assignment Number, Primary First Fixation, Primary Second Fixation, Previous Fixation Duration, First Fixation Duration, First Pass Fixation Duration, Next Fixation Duration, First Saccade Length, Last Saccade Length, Previous Fixation Position, Landing Position, Leaving Position, Total Fixation Duration, Mean Fixation Duration, Regression Length, Next Word Regression, Regression Duration, Pupil Diameter Maximum, Pupil Diameter Lag, Time Protection, Title Number, Word Number, Label.
