Masters Degrees Programs Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

I was searching for a Master's degree program in Data Science when I stumbled upon an amazing website called Masters Portal. I decided to scrape the entire website to take my time analyzing all Master's programs available around the world.

This comprehensive dataset contains Master's degree programs from universities across the globe. It provides a wealth of information about each program, including the country and city where the university is located, the name of the university and its ranking, the program name and type, application deadlines, duration of study, language of instruction, tuition fees, start dates, admission requirements, and other relevant details.

The dataset includes programs from institutions in nearly one hundred countries worldwide, offering a diverse range of study opportunities for students interested in pursuing a Master's degree abroad.

Country Name, University Name, Program Name, Deadline, Duration, Language, Tuition Fees, Start Date, City, and Program URL are some of the key features included in this extensive dataset.
