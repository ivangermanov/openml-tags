The sulfur recovery unit removes environmental pollutants from acid gas streams before they are released into the atmosphere, and furthermore, elemental sulfur is recovered as a valuable byproduct.

This dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark. The five input variables are gas flow and air flow. The two output variables to be predicted are Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide concentrations.

More information about this dataset can be found in Soft Sensors for Monitoring and Control of Industrial Processes.
