QSAR-TID-10434 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, and it has features that represent FCFP six molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src. The features represent FCFP six molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset has several features, including molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI fifty. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the protein Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, which is a single protein and a preferred name. It is also known as p sixty-Src, pp sixty c-Src, Proto-oncogene c-Src, and Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src.

The protein is involved in several biological processes, including primary ovarian follicle growth, positive regulation of cytokine production, and stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in several cellular components, including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion.

The protein has several molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, and protein tyrosine kinase activity. It is also involved in several protein-protein interactions, including binding to insulin receptor, integrin, and estrogen receptor.
