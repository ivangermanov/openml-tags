Inspiration:
Pokémon has been a beloved franchise for many years, and with this dataset, we aim to explore various aspects of the Pokémon world. We hope to answer questions such as:
Can we develop a model to identify legendary Pokémon?
How do physical characteristics relate to base statistics?
What factors influence experience growth and breeding requirements?
Are there correlations between these traits?
Which types are the strongest and weakest overall?
Which type is most likely to produce legendary Pokémon?
Can we create a dream team of six Pokémon that deal maximum damage while being resistant to opposing teams?
