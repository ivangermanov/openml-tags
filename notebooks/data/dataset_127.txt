The Cleveland Heart Disease Database contains seventy-six attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of fourteen of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by Machine Learning researchers to date. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from zero (no presence) to four. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values one, two, three, four) from absence (value zero).

The database contains information about patient identification, social security number (replaced with a dummy value), age, sex, chest pain location, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, smoking habits, fasting blood sugar, diabetes history, family history of coronary artery disease, resting electrocardiographic results, exercise electrocardiogram readings, and other relevant medical details.

Features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, and number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.

This database has missing values. The fourteen attributes used in experiments are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and diagnosis of heart disease.
