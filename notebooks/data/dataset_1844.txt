**MetaQSAR Project**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11617, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP features.

The dataset contains information about Protein Kinase C Eta, also known as nPKC-Eta, PKCL, or PRKCH. It is an enzyme that belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and PKC family.

Protein Kinase C Eta is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, cell differentiation, and regulation of primary metabolic process.

It is expressed in various tissues and has been implicated in different diseases.
