Toronto COVID-19 Cases

Tags: This dataset contains demographic, geographic, and severity information for all confirmed and probable cases reported to and managed by Toronto Public Health since the first case was reported in January. This includes cases that are sporadic, occurring in the community, and outbreak-associated. The data are extracted from the provincial communicable disease reporting system and Toronto's custom COVID-19 case management system and combined for reporting. The data in this spreadsheet are subject to change as public health investigations into reported cases and continuous quality improvement initiatives are ongoing, and additional cases continue to be reported.

The dataset features information on whether the case is outbreak-associated, the age group of the individual, the neighbourhood name, the forward sortation area, the source of infection, the classification of the case, the episode date, the reported date, the client's gender, the outcome of the case, and the hospitalization status of the individual.
