This dataset is similar to the CIFAR Ten, except it has one hundred classes containing six hundred images each. There are five hundred training images and one hundred testing images per class. The one hundred classes in the CIFAR One Hundred are grouped into twenty superclasses. Each image comes with a fine label, which is the class to which it belongs, and a coarse label, which is the superclass to which it belongs.

The dataset contains a large number of features, including pixel values, which are not human-readable.

The CIFAR One Hundred dataset is a valuable resource for machine learning and computer vision tasks, particularly those involving image classification and object recognition.

Keywords: image classification, object recognition, computer vision, machine learning, dataset.
