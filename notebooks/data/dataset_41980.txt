SAT11-HAND-runtime-regression Dataset

Tags: Algorithm Selection

This dataset is related to the field of Algorithm Selection, which involves selecting the best algorithm to solve a particular problem instance. The dataset is a collection of features extracted from SAT instances, which are used to train machine learning models to predict the runtime of different algorithms.

The dataset does not distinguish between timeout, memory out, or crashes, and the status file only contains "ok" or "timeout" status. If features are unknown, it means the instance was solved during feature computation. Although there is no necessary alignment and dependencies between the feature processing steps, the steps were executed in a fixed alignment, and therefore, all feature steps depend on the previous executed ones.

The features extracted from the SAT instances include various metrics, such as the number of variables and clauses, the ratio of variables to clauses, the mean and coefficient of variation of the positive to negative ratio of clauses, and many more.

Some of the features are related to the structure of the clauses, such as the mean and coefficient of variation of the variable graph, the horn clauses fraction, and the diameter of the graph. Other features are related to the solution process, such as the best solution mean, the first local minimum step mean, and the best average improvement mean.
