QSAR-TID-11107 Dataset Information

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11107. The dataset has eighty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains information about dipeptidyl peptidase four, also known as CD twenty-six, which is an enzyme belonging to the serine protease family. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, cell adhesion, and immune response.

Dipeptidyl peptidase four is a single-pass type two membrane protein that is expressed on the surface of certain cells, particularly immune cells called T cells. It plays a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of these cells.

The dataset provides information about the structure and function of dipeptidyl peptidase four, including its molecular interactions and enzymatic activities. It also includes data on its involvement in various diseases, such as cancer and inflammatory disorders.
