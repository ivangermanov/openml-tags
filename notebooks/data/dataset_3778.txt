Breast Cancer Gene Expression - CuMiDa 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

Dataset GSE45827 on breast cancer gene expression from CuMiDa contains six classes with fifty-six thousand seven hundred seventy-six genes and one hundred fifty-one samples.

The Curated Microarray Database, or CuMiDa, is a repository containing seventy-eight handpicked cancer microarray datasets, extensively curated from thirty thousand studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus, solely for machine learning. The primary goal of CuMiDa is to offer homogeneous and state-of-the-art biological preprocessing of these datasets, together with numerous three-fold cross-validation benchmark results to propel machine learning studies focused on cancer research.

The database provides various download options to be employed by other programs, as well as Principal Component Analysis and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding results. CuMiDa stands out from existing databases by offering newer datasets, manually and carefully curated, from sample quality, unwanted probes, background correction, and normalization, to create a more reliable source of data for computational research.

This dataset raises several questions, including how to deal with class imbalance for classification, how to identify the most important genes for the classification of each cancer subtype, whether it is possible to discover new subtypes, and how to improve upon the classification and clustering benchmarks for this dataset listed on the CuMiDa website.

Features include samples and types, among others.
