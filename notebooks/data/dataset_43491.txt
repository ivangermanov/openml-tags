Tags: Statistics on a Blockbreaker-like Game

The dataset is based on a blockbreaker-like game, which is currently under development. The game's foundation is the "Block Breaker" section of the Complete C Unity Developer 2D course, where the developer learned to code and make games. After creating numerous levels, the need arose to sort them by difficulty. Measuring the difficulty of a level is a complex task, and a first-cut solution was to design an auto-play bot that is not perfect, and observe its performance on each level through thousands of trials.

A video of the game in auto-play action is available, showcasing the bot's gameplay. The dataset includes the following fields:

Date: The date and time the game was auto-played
Level: The name of the level, which includes an estimate of the difficulty from a previous run (no longer valid after tweaking)
Number of Blocks: The number of blocks that need to be broken to win the level
Is Win: A boolean indicating whether the auto-play bot broke all the blocks or the ball fell past the paddle
Elapsed Time: The time in seconds until either winning or losing the game (played at four times the normal speed, so multiply by four to estimate the time a human player might take)
Score: The total score when the game was won or lost
Accuracy: The auto-play bot's accuracy, which is tuned with a randomly chosen value; higher numbers indicate a higher likelihood of winning
