QSAR-TID-10808 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10808. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains one hundred fifty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Edg-2 is a single protein, also known as EDG2, LPA1, LPA-1, LPAR1, and LPA Receptor 1. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a Small Molecule Receptor. It is involved in the Lipid-like Ligand Receptor pathway.

The receptor is targeted by the compound BMS-986020, a small molecule Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Edg-2 antagonist.

The receptor is expressed in various cellular components, including the cytoplasm, endosome, plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, endocytic vesicle, presynaptic membrane, neuronal cell body, dendritic spine, and dendritic shaft. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
