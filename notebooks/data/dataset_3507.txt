QSAR-TID-10808 Dataset: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10808. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10808. 

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint, and many others. 

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
