Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers. The final feature is labeled as binaryClass.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been converted into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the original numeric target feature and then categorizing instances based on their relation to this mean value. Instances falling below the mean were classified as positive, denoted by 'P', while those above or equal to the mean were classified as negative, denoted by 'N'. This binarization technique allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a continuous or multi-class problem.

The dataset likely contains multiple numerical features, as indicated by the feature names starting with 'oz' followed by numbers. These features may represent various measurements or attributes relevant to the classification task at hand. The final feature, binaryClass, represents the newly created binary target variable resulting from the aforementioned conversion process.
