This dataset, named BNG (lymph, nominal), is tagged as artificial and BNG. It contains various features related to lymphatic system characteristics and conditions. These features include lymphatics, blockages in afferent lymph vessels, lymph circulation and structure, bypass mechanisms, extravasation, regeneration processes, early uptake patterns, changes in lymph node size (both diminished and enlarged), alterations in lymph composition, nodal defects, structural modifications, special morphological forms, dislocation events, exclusion phenomena, and quantification of lymph nodes. The dataset also includes a class feature for categorization purposes.
