The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting research. 

The dataset names are coded based on their characteristics, including colinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

These datasets were designed to test various aspects of machine learning algorithms, including their ability to handle linear and nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs, as well as their robustness to noisy data and irrelevant features.

The Friedman function, which generates these datasets, includes both linear and nonlinear terms and adds a normalized noise term to the output. 

In its original form, the Friedman function takes five inputs, but additional features are added to the datasets to measure the effect of non-related features on algorithm performance. 

To further challenge the algorithms, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity among the features. This means that some features depend on others, requiring the algorithms to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information.

The resulting eighty datasets vary in terms of the number of features, sample size, and colinearity degree. 

Features include various attributes, although not all of them are directly related to the output. 

The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.
