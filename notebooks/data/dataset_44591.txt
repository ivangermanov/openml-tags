Eucalyptus Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Cols One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Subsampling of the dataset Eucalyptus with Seed equals Three arguments N Rows Max equals Two Thousand arguments N Cols Max equals One Hundred arguments N Classes Max equals Ten arguments No Stratify equals False.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters such as seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and whether to stratify or not, and returns a dataset.

The uniform sampling of classes involves selecting unique classes from the target variable, and if the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, then the function selects a specified number of classes based on their frequency of occurrence.

The uniform sampling of columns involves selecting a specified number of columns randomly, and if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, then the function selects a specified number of columns randomly.

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, then the function applies stratified sampling to select a specified number of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is maintained.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to strings and returns the resulting dataset.
