Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eucalyptus with seed equals three arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals false

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of classes from the unique classes in the dataset, ensuring that the number of selected classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. The function then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, the function uniformly samples columns to reduce the dimensionality. Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the dataset and samples a subset of rows.
