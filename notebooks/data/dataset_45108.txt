Dutch Twitter Dataset
Tags: Context

A collection of tweets in Dutch and features gathered in April using the Twitter API. A small portion of the tweets are annotated by volunteer annotators. The main task is to identify which of the tweets are rumors, based on the features and the labeled examples in the dataset.

Content

The dataset includes various features that describe the tweets and the accounts that posted them. These features include the number of users following the account, the number of tweets by the account, the presence of question marks, and whether the account is verified or not. Additionally, the dataset includes features such as the account's life, the ratio of followers to users followed, the presence of exclamation marks, and the ratio of capital to lowercase letters.

Other features include the number of retweets on the tweet, the presence of hashtags, the number of users the account follows, the length of the text, the number of lists the account is in, the presence of emoticons, and the number of likes on the tweet. The dataset also includes features such as the time the account existed before posting the tweet, the account's activity, and the text of the tweet itself.

The tweets are categorized into three hashtags: Jinek, Vleestaks, and Inflatie. The dataset also includes an upsample group feature to allow for equal sampling of each combination of hashtag and label. The label feature indicates whether the tweet is a rumor or not, with one indicating a rumor, zero indicating a non-rumor, and negative one indicating an unannotated tweet.
