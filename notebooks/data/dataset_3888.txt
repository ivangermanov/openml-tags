Context:
People love movies because they take you on a journey, providing an escape from reality. As a vivid movie watcher, I am always amazed at how websites like Netflix and Hotstar accurately suggest the next movie I had planned to watch, almost as if they could read my mind. This led me to research and create something similar, starting with extracting a massive dataset of movies people love to watch and applying analysis to it.

Content:
The dataset contains the following information:

* Popularity: A measure of how well-known and widely viewed the movie is.
* Vote Count: The total number of people who have voted for the movie.
* Title: The name of the movie.
* Vote Average: The average rating given to the movie by its viewers.
* Overview: A brief summary of the movie's storyline.
* Release Date: The date when the movie was first released.

Inspiration:
I would love to uncover answers to questions such as:

What is the relationship between a movie's popularity and its average vote count?

Which machine learning algorithm would be most effective in finding relationships between different movies?
