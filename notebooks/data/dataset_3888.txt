This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. This dataset is useful for studying the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity.

The target protein is Prolyl Endopeptidase, also known as PEP or Post-proline Cleaving Enzyme. It belongs to the serine protease family and is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis. It is primarily located in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells.

The dataset includes multiple features, including molecule ChEMBL ID, molecule properties, and biological activity. These features can be used to build predictive models of biological activity and to identify potential drug candidates.
