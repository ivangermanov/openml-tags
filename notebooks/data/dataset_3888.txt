QSAR-TID-11968 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11968. The dataset has several rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11968.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Prolyl Endopeptidase enzyme, which is a single protein target. The enzyme is also known as PEP, Post-proline Cleaving Enzyme, and PREP. It belongs to the Serine Protease SC clan and Serine Protease S9A subfamily. The enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, and has been implicated in several diseases.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the Prolyl Endopeptidase enzyme in different tissues and cells, as well as its subcellular localization. The enzyme is expressed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cytosol, and is also found in the membrane. It has been shown to have serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding activity, and peptidase activity.
