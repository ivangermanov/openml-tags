**Student Performance in Mathematics**

This dataset approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, which were collected using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language.

The dataset was modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. An important note is that the target attribute, Final Grade, has a strong correlation with the First Period Grade and Second Period Grade. This occurs because the Final Grade is the final year grade issued at the third period, while the First Period Grade and Second Period Grade correspond to the first and second period grades. It is more difficult to predict the Final Grade without the First Period Grade and Second Period Grade, but such prediction is much more useful.

The attributes include student's school, sex, age, home address type, family size, parent's cohabitation status, mother's education, father's education, mother's job, father's job, reason to choose this school, student's guardian, home to school travel time, weekly study time, number of past class failures, extra educational support, family educational support, extra paid classes, extra-curricular activities, attended nursery school, wants to take higher education, Internet access at home, romantic relationship, quality of family relationships, free time after school, going out with friends, workday alcohol consumption, weekend alcohol consumption, current health status, and number of school absences.

The grades are related to the course subject, Mathematics, and include the First Period Grade, Second Period Grade, and Final Grade.
