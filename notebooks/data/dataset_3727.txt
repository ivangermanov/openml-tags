The QSAR-TID-12076 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2.

This dataset has been extracted from ChEMBL version seventeen and consists of five hundred twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (FCFPs) which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The features include molecule identifiers and molecular fingerprints.

The Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2 is a single protein target classified under the category of membrane receptors, specifically Family A G protein-coupled receptors. It belongs to the species group Rattus norvegicus.

The description of this target includes its relationship with other proteins, including its synonyms, Chrm2 and Chrm-2. It also involves various biological processes such as regulation of smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and chemical synaptic transmission.

Additionally, this target participates in several cellular components, including plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, asymmetric synapse, symmetric synapse, presynaptic membrane, neuronal cell body, axon terminus, synapse, postsynaptic membrane, presynapse, glutamatergic synapse, and cholinergic synapse.
