QSAR-TID-12017 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12017. The dataset has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12017. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Neuropeptide Y receptor type two, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is classified as a Family A G protein-coupled receptor and a peptide receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including behavioral fear response, positive regulation of peptide secretion, and signal transduction.

The dataset also contains information on the gene ontology of the Neuropeptide Y receptor type two, including its cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The receptor is located in the plasma membrane, cilium, and membrane, and is involved in peptide YY receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and neuropeptide Y receptor activity.
