Updated Wine Enthusiast Reviews

Tags: Context

I built this dataset on the foundation of the original dataset found on Kaggle, updating the scraper to fetch fresh data. This dataset contains all wine reviews from WineMag.com, spanning the years from two thousand seventeen to two thousand twenty. To ensure data integrity, duplicates have been cleared, and the vintage information has been parsed from the title. It is worth noting that NV denotes non-vintage wines.

This dataset boasts a comprehensive collection of features, including the country of origin, a detailed description, the wine's designation, points awarded, price, province, region, and sub-region, as well as the name, photo, and Twitter handle of the taster. Additionally, the title, variety, vintage, and winery information are also included.
