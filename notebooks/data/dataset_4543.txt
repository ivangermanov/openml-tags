Subsampling of the dataset Ada with Seed equals Three 
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Ada dataset, which has forty-one thousand one hundred fifty-six instances. The subsampling process was done using a random number generator with a seed value of three.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the classes were uniformly sampled to select a maximum of ten classes. This was done by selecting classes based on their frequency distribution.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to select a maximum of one hundred columns. This was done by randomly selecting column indices.

Finally, the rows were subsampled to select a maximum of two thousand instances. This was done using stratified sampling, which ensures that the class distribution remains the same as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a total of forty-three features, including the class variable. Unfortunately, the feature names are not human-readable and have been kept in their original format.
