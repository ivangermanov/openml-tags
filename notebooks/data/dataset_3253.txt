QSAR-TID-11104 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11104. The dataset has twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it includes a range of features that can be used to predict this activity.

The features in the dataset are primarily FCFP 1024-bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that can be used to capture the structural properties of molecules. These features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery, as it provides a large collection of activity data and molecular features that can be used to develop predictive models.
