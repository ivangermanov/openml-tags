This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-11104, falls under the categories of Images, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR, and is part of the MetaQSAR project dating back to September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of various compounds on the drug target TID: 11104. It consists of twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating these fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

Some of the features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty. 

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR project, drug target, compound activity.
