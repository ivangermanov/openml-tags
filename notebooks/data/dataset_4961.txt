The Water Bayesian Network, also known as Sample Nine, is a discrete medium-sized network consisting of thirty-two nodes connected by sixty-six arcs, which translates to ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree of each node is four point one two, with a maximum in-degree of five.

This network was originally part of the Bayesian Network Repository and has been widely used as a benchmark for testing various machine learning algorithms.

The Water Bayesian Network represents an expert system designed to control waste water treatment plants. It models various factors influencing the treatment process, including chemical and biological oxygen demands, nitrogen levels, and other relevant variables.
