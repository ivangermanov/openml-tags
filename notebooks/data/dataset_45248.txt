Pathfinder Bayesian Network Sample Seven is a discrete very large Bayesian network repository referenced on the bnlearn website. This network consists of a total number of nodes and a total number of arcs, resulting in a substantial amount of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of this network are notable, with a maximum in-degree.

The Pathfinder project was designed towards normative expert systems, and this sample seven is part of that endeavor. The network is characterized by its complex structure, with various fault variables playing a crucial role.

Features of this network include fault variables, among others.
