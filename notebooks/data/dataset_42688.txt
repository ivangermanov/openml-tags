Brazilian Houses Tags: 

This dataset contains houses to rent with thirteen different features. Please cite this dataset when using it. 

Some values in the dataset can be considered outliers for further analyses. Bear in mind that a web crawler was used only to get the data, so it's possible that errors in the original data exist. 

Changes in data between versions of the dataset may occur. Since the web crawler was run on different days for each version of the dataset, there may be differences like added or deleted houses, as well as added cities. 

Notes: This dataset corresponds to the second version of the original dataset. The value 'hyphen' in the attribute floor was replaced by 'zero' as it refers to houses with just one floor. 

Features: city, area, rooms, bathroom, parking spaces, floor, animal, furniture, Homeowners Association, rent amount, property tax, fire insurance, total.
