MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty. The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID 

This dataset is related to the study of Carboxypeptidase B, a single protein preferred name, also known as CPB or CPB one, pancreas-specific protein PASP. It is an enzyme, a protease, a metallo protease, belonging to the metallo protease M fourteen A subfamily. 

The description of this protein includes its relationship with accession, expression atlas, component, function, process, can SAR target, guide to pharmacology, interact, pharm GKB, pharos, reactome, uniprot, interpro, pfam, and pdbE.
