The QSAR-TID-100906 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100906. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor Tie-One, which is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including TIE and Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor Tie-One. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and TK protein kinase group, specifically the tyrosine protein kinase Tie family.

The dataset also includes information about the mechanism of action, maximum phase, first approval, USAN stem, and references. Additionally, it provides details about the parent molecule, including its ChEMBL ID, parent molecule name, parent molecule type, mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval.

Furthermore, the dataset includes information about gene ontology components, functions, and processes. It covers various aspects such as plasma membrane, membrane, receptor complex, nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, angiogenesis, blood vessel development, vasculogenesis, in utero embryonic development, regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, aortic valve morphogenesis, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, mesoderm development, phosphorylation, negative regulation of angiogenesis, negative regulation of cell migration, response to retinoic acid, positive regulation of kinase activity, plasma membrane fusion, positive regulation of angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation, branching involved in lymph vessel morphogenesis, and regulation of extracellular matrix assembly.
