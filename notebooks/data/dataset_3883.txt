QSAR-TID-11090 Dataset Information:

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11090. It has nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty.

Dataset Information Continued:

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11090.

The data includes information about caspase five, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in apoptosis, or programmed cell death.

Caspase Five Information:

Caspase five, also known as caspase five subunit p ten and caspase five subunit p twenty, is an enzyme that belongs to the cysteine protease family.

It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, apoptotic process, regulation of apoptotic process, and execution phase of apoptosis.

Caspase five has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
