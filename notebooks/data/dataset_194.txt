The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset contains information on heart disease patients. It originally had 76 attributes, but most published experiments use a subset of 14 features. The "goal" field indicates the presence of heart disease, with values ranging from 0 (no presence) to 4. Research has focused on distinguishing presence (values 1-4) from absence (value 0).

Patient names and social security numbers were removed and replaced with dummy values. One processed file contains the Cleveland database, while four unprocessed files are also available. The dataset includes information on age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope of peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thalassemia, and diagnosis of heart disease.

Additional attributes cover various aspects of patient health and medical history, including chest pain location, smoking habits, family history of coronary artery disease, exercise test details, and medication use during tests. The exercise protocol includes options such as Bruce, Kottus, McHenry, fast Balke, Balke, Noughton, and various bike and arm ergometer settings.

The dataset contains missing values and includes information on exercise wall motion, ejection fraction, and cardiac catheterization details. Researchers are requested to cite the dataset in any resulting publications.
