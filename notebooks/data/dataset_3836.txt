Life Science dataset QSAR-TID-142, tagged as MTLQSAR and study_3, originates from the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015.

This dataset contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 142, with three hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, followed by FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, ranging from FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero to FCFP six one thousand twenty-four nine hundred ninety-nine.

The dataset is related to the Prostanoid EP two receptor, also known as the PGE two receptor EP two subtype, PGE receptor EP two subtype, and Prostaglandin E two receptor EP two subtype, with synonyms including PTGER two. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein, specifically a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and prostanoid receptor.

Description and relationship accessions are provided for the Prostaglandin E two receptor EP two subtype, along with its mechanism of action and maximum phase. First approval and USAN stem references are also included.

Browse all items per page, showcasing one to five out of six records, featuring parent molecules, mechanism of action, max phase, first approval, and USAN stem references.
