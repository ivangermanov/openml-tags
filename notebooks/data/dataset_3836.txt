QSAR-TID-142 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 142. The dataset has three hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The Prostanoid EP2 receptor is a single protein target, also known as the Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP2 subtype, PGE2 receptor EP2 subtype, and Prostanoid EP2 receptor. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor group and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and cell population proliferation.

The receptor is activated by prostaglandin E2, a lipid-like ligand, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes, including the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, response to nematode, and response to lipopolysaccharide.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Prostanoid EP2 receptor.
