The QSAR-TID-30006 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30006. This dataset has eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI fifty.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is tagged with Government, MTLQSAR, Politics, and study three.

The dataset is related to the single protein serine threonine protein kinase ten, which is also known as lymphocyte oriented kinase. This protein is part of the enzyme kinase protein kinase group, specifically the STE protein kinase STE twenty family, STE protein kinase SLK subfamily.

It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, phosphorylation, protein autophosphorylation, lymphocyte aggregation, and regulation of lymphocyte migration. It is also associated with several cellular components, including cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, membrane, specific granule membrane, and extracellular exosome.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, serine threonine protein kinase, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, phosphorylation.
