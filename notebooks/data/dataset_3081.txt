QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI50) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC50). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Insulin-like growth factor I receptor, a single protein target. This receptor is also known as CD antigen CD, IGF1R, IGF-I receptor, Insulin-like growth factor receptor, and Insulin-like growth factor receptor alpha chain. It is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase InsR family.

The Insulin-like growth factor I receptor is involved in various biological processes, including cardiac atrium development, protein phosphorylation, immune response, signal transduction, axonogenesis, cell population proliferation, insulin receptor signaling pathway, and response to hormones. It plays roles in cellular processes such as establishment of cell polarity, positive regulation of cell migration, neuron projection development, and response to nutrient levels.

This receptor has multiple molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, G-protein alpha-subunit binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, insulin receptor activity, and insulin-like growth factor receptor activity. It is involved in binding to insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and other proteins.

The Insulin-like growth factor I receptor is found in various cellular components, including the plasma membrane, insulin receptor complex, caveola, T-tubule, axon, and neuronal cell body. It is part of protein complexes such as the alphav-beta integrin-IGF-IGF1R complex and receptor complexes.

Several compounds targeting this receptor have been studied, including AEW (a small molecule inhibitor), ROBATUMUMAB (an antibody antagonist), DALOTUZUMAB (an antibody antagonist), FIGITUMUMAB (an antibody antagonist), and AXL (a small molecule inhibitor).
