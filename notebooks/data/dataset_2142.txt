This dataset has twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. The features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is an identifier for each molecule in the dataset. The median pXC fifty is a measure of the potency of a compound.

The features include molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as numerical vectors. These vectors can be used to predict the biological activity of molecules.

The dataset also includes information about the target protein, Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha, which is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in regulating gene expression.

Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha is involved in various biological processes, including transcription, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. It also regulates the expression of genes involved in embryonic development, cell growth, and differentiation.
