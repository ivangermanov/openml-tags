Blood Transfusion Service Center Seed One Name

Tags: Subsampling of the Blood Transfusion Service Center dataset with seed equals one arguments number rows equals two thousand arguments number columns equals one hundred arguments number classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true

Generated with the following source code:

def subsample(self, seed, number rows maximum, number columns maximum, number classes maximum, stratified)

The function takes in parameters such as a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean value indicating whether to use stratification.

Random Number Generator is used with the given seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. The input data X and Y are taken from the dataset.

Uniformly Sample Classes - If the number of unique classes in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed number of classes, then a subset of classes is randomly selected based on their frequency distribution.

Select Indices - The indices corresponding to the selected classes are identified, and the input data X and Y are filtered accordingly.

Uniformly Sample Columns - If the number of columns in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed number of columns, then a subset of columns is randomly selected.

Stratified Sampling - If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed number of rows, then stratified sampling is applied using the train-test-split function from scikit-learn library.

Categorical Columns - Categorical columns are converted to string format to ensure compatibility with OpenML.

Return Dataset - A new dataset object is created with the processed data X, Y, categorical mask, and column names.
