Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Blood Transfusion Service Center with seed equals one, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the dataset. If the number of classes exceeds the maximum, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows. Finally, it returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
