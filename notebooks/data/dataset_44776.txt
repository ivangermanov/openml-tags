Name: sf-police-incidents Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset sf-police-incidents with seed equal to three, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in self, seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses numpy's random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects the features x and target y from the dataset. If the number of unique classes in the target is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes using random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates the features and target accordingly. If the number of columns in the features is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows in the features is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses train test split with stratification based on the target to select the subset of rows. Finally, it returns a dataset with the updated features, target, categorical mask, and columns.

Features: Hour of the Day, Day of the Week, Month of the Year, Year, Police District, Address, X Coordinate, Y Coordinate, Violent Crime
