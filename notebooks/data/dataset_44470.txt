Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Yeast with seed equals two arguments N Rows equals two thousand arguments N Columns equals one hundred arguments N Classes equals ten arguments No Stratify equals False

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as parameters. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects the data and target arrays from the dataset. 

If the number of unique classes in the target array is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes using a random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates the data and target arrays accordingly.

If the number of columns in the data array is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the columns using a random choice and updates the data array accordingly. 

If the number of rows in the data array is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses train test split with stratification to select a subset of the data and target arrays. 

Finally, it returns a dataset with the updated data and target arrays, along with the categorical mask and column names.
