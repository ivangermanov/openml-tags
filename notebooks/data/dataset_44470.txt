The Yeast dataset has been subsampled with a specific set of arguments to generate a new dataset. The subsampling process involves uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset while maintaining its inherent characteristics.

The Yeast dataset has been uniformly sampled to select a specified number of classes. This is done by choosing classes randomly based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset. The selected classes are then used to filter out the corresponding data points, resulting in a reduced dataset.

Furthermore, the dataset has been uniformly sampled to select a specified number of columns. This is done by choosing column indices randomly and then selecting the corresponding columns from the dataset.

Additionally, the dataset has been stratified to ensure that the class distribution remains consistent throughout the sampling process. This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets based on the class labels, ensuring that each set maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected columns, rows, and classes, which have been carefully chosen to maintain the integrity of the original dataset. The dataset has also been converted to ensure that categorical columns are represented as strings.
