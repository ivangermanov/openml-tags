QSAR-TID-10304 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10304. The dataset has a total of 992 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dopamine D1 receptor, also known as D(1A) dopamine receptor, Drd1, and Drd1a. The Dopamine D1 receptor is a single protein and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.

The Dopamine D1 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, conditioned taste aversion, behavioral fear response, neuron migration, regulation of protein phosphorylation, and synaptic transmission. It is also involved in the regulation of various cellular components, including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and caveola.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is involved in various diseases, including neurological disorders and addiction.
