Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements with Seed Four 
Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This subsampling function generates a smaller dataset from the original Eye Movements dataset. The function takes several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratified sampling.

The function begins by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If there are more unique classes than the specified maximum, it selects the desired number of classes using their value counts as probabilities. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum, it randomly chooses the desired number of columns without replacement. Otherwise, it uses all columns.

Finally, the function samples rows using stratified splitting if necessary. If the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum, it splits the data into a subset of the desired size, ensuring that each class is represented proportionally. It then returns a new dataset containing the sampled data, along with information about the categorical columns and feature names.
