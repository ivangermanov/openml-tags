Name: Eye Movements Seed Four N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements with seed equal to four, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. The function then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. It first selects a subset of classes, then selects a subset of columns, and finally selects a subset of rows. The function returns a new dataset with the selected data.

The dataset is subsampled to reduce its size while maintaining its overall characteristics. The subsampling is done in a stratified manner to ensure that the new dataset has the same class distribution as the original dataset. The function is useful for reducing the size of large datasets while preserving their essential features.
