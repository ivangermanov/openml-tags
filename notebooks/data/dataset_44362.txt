California Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset California with seed equal to zero, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that has been subsampled. It uses a random number generator with a specified seed to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the subsetted dataset, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. If the number of rows in the subsetted dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
