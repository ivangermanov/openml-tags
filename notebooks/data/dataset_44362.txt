This dataset is a subsampled version of the California dataset, which originally had forty-four thousand ninety entries. The subsampling process involved randomly selecting entries based on specific criteria to reduce the number of rows, columns, and classes.

The subsampling process began by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. Since there were more than ten classes, a random selection of ten classes was made, ensuring that each class had an equal probability of being chosen. The indices of the entries corresponding to these chosen classes were then selected.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled. Since there were more than one hundred columns, a random selection of one hundred columns was made, ensuring that each column had an equal probability of being chosen. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset.

Finally, the number of rows was reduced to two thousand. To ensure that the sampling was stratified, the entries were split into subsets based on their class labels, and then a random selection of two thousand entries was made from these subsets.

The resulting dataset contains the following features: Median Income, House Age, Average Rooms, Average Bedrooms, Population, Average Occupation, Latitude, Longitude, and Price.
