Forest Fires Data Set

This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data.

The output variable, burned area, was first transformed with a natural logarithm function to stabilize the variance and make the data more normally distributed. Then, several data mining methods were applied to the transformed data. After fitting the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the natural logarithm transform to obtain the original units.

Four different input setups were used, and the experiments were conducted using a ten-fold cross-validation method repeated thirty times. Two regression metrics were measured: Mean Absolute Deviation and Root Mean Squared Error.

A Gaussian support vector machine fed with only four direct weather conditions, namely temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and outside rain, obtained the best Mean Absolute Deviation value. The best Root Mean Squared Error was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis of the regression error curve shows that the support vector machine model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect, the support vector machine model predicts better small fires, which are the majority.

Attribute Information:

The dataset consists of thirteen attributes, including spatial coordinates, month and day of the week, fire weather indices, and meteorological data.

The spatial coordinates, X and Y, are the x-axis and y-axis coordinates within the Montesinho park map.

The month attribute represents the month of the year, ranging from January to December.

The day attribute represents the day of the week, ranging from Monday to Sunday.

The fire weather indices, FFMC, DMC, DC, and ISI, are part of the Fire Weather Index system.

The meteorological data includes temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and outside rain.

The burned area of the forest is the output variable, which is highly skewed towards zero, making it suitable for logarithmic transformation.
