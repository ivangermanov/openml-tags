Forest Fires Data Set

This is a challenging regression task, where the goal is to predict the burned area of forest fires in the northeastern region of Portugal, using meteorological and other data.

Data Set Information:

The output variable, area, was initially transformed using a natural logarithm function plus one to stabilize its variance. Several data mining methods were then applied, followed by post-processing with the inverse of the transformation to obtain the final predictions. Four different input setups were used in the experiments, which were conducted using tenfold cross-validation repeated thirty times. Two regression metrics were evaluated: Mean Absolute Deviation and Root Mean Squared Error.

Attribute Information:

One. X Axis Spatial Coordinate represents the location within the Montesinho park map.
Two. Y Axis Spatial Coordinate represents the location within the Montesinho park map.
Three. Month of the Year indicates when the fire occurred.
Four. Day of the Week indicates when the fire occurred.
Five. Fine Fuel Moisture Code Index measures the dryness of fine fuels.
Six. Duff Moisture Code Index measures the dryness of organic material on the ground.
Seven. Drought Code Index measures the dryness of deeper organic layers.
Eight. Initial Spread Index measures how quickly a fire spreads.
Nine. Temperature measures the air temperature in Celsius degrees.
Ten. Relative Humidity measures the air moisture content.
Eleven. Wind Speed measures the air movement in kilometers per hour.
Twelve. Outside Rain measures precipitation in millimeters per square meter.
Thirteen. Burned Area of the Forest measures the size of the affected area in hectares.
