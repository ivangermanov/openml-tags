The MIP 2016 Regression dataset is a collection of algorithm runtime data and features generated from the solvable instances of MIPLIB 2010. This dataset is part of the Open Algorithm Challenge 2017, also known as Mira. 

The algorithm runtime data was taken directly from the twelve threads table of evaluations. The features were generated using the MIP feature computation code. To record runtimes of the feature computations, the runsolver tool was used. 

The dataset includes a wide range of features, including instance identification, problem type, number of variables, number of constraints, number of non-zero coefficients, and linear programming relaxation values. Additionally, it includes features related to variable and constraint characteristics, such as the number of binary, integer, continuous, and semi-continuous variables, as well as the ratio of these variables to the total number of variables. 

Other features include support size statistics, right-hand side coefficient statistics, variable and constraint degree statistics, and objective coefficient statistics.
