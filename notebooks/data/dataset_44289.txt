The Meta Album Cars Dataset is a collection of images featuring various car models. This dataset is a mini version of the original Cars dataset, which was gathered in 2013 and consists of over sixteen thousand images from one hundred ninety-six classes of cars. Most images depict cars on the road, while others have diverse backgrounds, and each image contains only one car.

Each class can have a range of forty-eight to one hundred thirty-six images of varying resolutions. To pre-process the dataset, square images were created by either duplicating the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right-most three columns based on the original image's orientation. Cropping was not applied to create the square images, as this method would result in losing vital information about the cars. Subsequently, the square images were resized to one hundred twenty-eight pixels by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
