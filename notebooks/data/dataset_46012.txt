Flycraft Demonstrations 

Tags: Demonstrations 

This dataset consists of demonstrations generated by the Iterative Regularized Policy Optimization with Imperfect Demonstrations algorithm for Flycraft. The demonstrations feature a range of attributes, including the state of the aircraft at a given timestamp, its orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw, its velocity, and its position in three-dimensional space. Additionally, the demonstrations include the desired velocity, direction, and orientation of the aircraft, as well as the control inputs required to achieve these goals.
