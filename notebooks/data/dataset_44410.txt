Name: Phoneme Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Phoneme with seed equal to three, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes from the unique values in the target variable y. If the number of unique classes exceeds nclasses max, it selects nclasses max classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds ncols max, it selects ncols max columns randomly and subsets the data accordingly.

Finally, if the number of rows exceeds nrows max, it stratifies the data according to the target variable and selects a subset of nrows max rows using train test split.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
