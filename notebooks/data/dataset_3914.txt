QSAR-TID-100431 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100431. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Free Fatty Acid Receptor 1, which is a single protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion. The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor that responds to free fatty acids and is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism.

The dataset contains information on the chemical structure of compounds, their activity values, and their relationship to the Free Fatty Acid Receptor 1. This information can be used to develop predictive models of compound activity and to identify potential drug candidates.
