The Solar Flare dataset is a multivariate regression data set that includes three target variables corresponding to the frequency of three types of solar flares - common, moderate, and severe - observed within a twenty-four hour period. This dataset comes in two versions, with one version containing data from nineteen sixty-nine and the other containing data from nineteen seventy-eight. 

The dataset includes various features that describe different aspects of solar flares, including the Zurich class, largest spot size, spot distribution, activity level, evolution, previous day's activity, historical complexity, whether it becomes historically complex, total area, area of the largest spot, C class, M class, and X class.
