QSAR-TID-100633 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100633. It has thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
