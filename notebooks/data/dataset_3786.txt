QSAR-TID-100633 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100633. The dataset has thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Proteasome Component C5. The target is a single protein, also known as Macropain Subunit C5, Multicatalytic Endopeptidase Complex Subunit C5, Proteasome Gamma Chain, and Proteasome Subunit Beta Type-One. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, threonine protease, threonine protease PBT clan, and threonine protease T1A subfamily.

The target is involved in various biological processes, including proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process, and regulation of activated PAK-two p thirty-four by proteasome mediated degradation. It is also involved in the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase, asymmetric localization of PCP proteins, and degradation of AXIN and DVL.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction of drug-target interactions.
