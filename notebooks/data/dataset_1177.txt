MicroMass - Mixed 

A dataset to explore machine learning approaches for the identification of microorganisms from mass-spectrometry data.

This dataset consists of a reference panel of twenty Gram positive and negative bacterial species covering nine genera, including several species known to be difficult to discriminate by mass spectrometry. Each species is represented by eleven to sixty mass spectra obtained from seven to twenty bacterial strains, constituting a total dataset of five hundred seventy-one spectra obtained from two hundred thirteen strains. 

The spectra were obtained according to the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routine, where the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, before a portion of the colony was picked, spotted on a MALDI slide, and a mass spectrum was acquired.

Based on this reference panel, a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was constituted. We considered ten pairs of species of various taxonomic proximity, including four mixtures involving species that belong to the same genus, two mixtures involving species that belong to distinct genera but to the same Gram type, and four mixtures involving species that belong to distinct Gram types. 

Each mixture was represented by two pairs of strains, which were mixed according to nine concentration ratios. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each couple of strains, leading to a total dataset of three hundred sixty spectra, among which eighty are actually pure sample spectra.
