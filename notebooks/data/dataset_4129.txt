QSAR-TID-12327 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12327. It has forty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project was conducted in September two thousand fifteen. This dataset should be cited when used.

The dataset contains demographic information about the compounds, including their molecule ChEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each compound. The Median PXc50 is a measure of the compound's activity on the target protein.

The FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor that captures the structural properties of the compounds. These descriptors were generated from the SMILES strings of the compounds using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
