QSAR-TID-100914 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand nine hundred fourteen, and it has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints from zero to nine hundred twenty-six.
