The dataset includes a comprehensive set of features that provide insights into various aspects of the segment. These features include the Region Centroid Column, which represents the central point of the region along the column axis, and the Region Centroid Row, which represents the central point of the region along the row axis.

Additionally, the dataset includes the Region Pixel Count, which provides information on the number of pixels within the region. The Short Line Density Five and Short Line Density Two features offer insight into the density of short lines within the segment.

Other notable features include the V Edge Mean and V Edge Standard Deviation, which provide information on the vertical edges within the segment, as well as the H Edge Mean and H Edge Standard Deviation, which provide information on the horizontal edges.

Furthermore, the dataset includes features related to color and intensity, such as Intensity Mean, Raw Red Mean, Raw Blue Mean, Raw Green Mean, Ex Red Mean, Ex Blue Mean, Ex Green Mean, Value Mean, Saturation Mean, and Hue Mean.

Finally, the dataset includes a classification feature, which assigns a class label to each segment based on its characteristics.
