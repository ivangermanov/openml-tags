The data concerns city cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of one multivalued discrete and five continuous attributes. This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use of predicting the attribute miles per gallon, six of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the miles per gallon attribute.

The dataset features include the engine displacement, horsepower, vehicle weight, acceleration, model year, and miles per gallon.
