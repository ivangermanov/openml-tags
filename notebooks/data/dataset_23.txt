This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. The samples consist of married women who were either not pregnant or uncertain about their pregnancy status at the time of the interview. The primary objective is to predict a woman's current contraceptive method choice (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) based on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.

The dataset contains instances with attributes including the wife's age, education level of both wife and husband, number of children ever born, wife's religion, wife's employment status, husband's occupation, standard of living index, and media exposure. The class attribute represents the contraceptive method used.

Wife's age is a numerical attribute, while education levels for both wife and husband are categorical, ranging from low to high. The number of children ever born is also numerical. Wife's religion is a binary attribute distinguishing between Non-Islam and Islam. Wife's employment status is binary, indicating whether she is currently working or not. Husband's occupation is categorized into four groups. The standard of living index is categorical, ranging from low to high. Media exposure is binary, classified as either good or not good.

The class attribute, contraceptive method used, has three possible values: no use, long-term methods, and short-term methods. This dataset does not contain any missing attribute values.

This dataset has been used in various studies comparing prediction accuracy, complexity, and training time of classification algorithms. It provides valuable insights into factors influencing contraceptive choices among Indonesian women and can be utilized for developing predictive models in the field of family planning and public health.
