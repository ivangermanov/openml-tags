Wave Energy

Tags: Machine Learning, Medicine

This dataset consists of positions and absorbed power outputs of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) in four real wave scenarios from the southern coast of Australia. The data is obtained from an optimization method, specifically blackbox optimization, with the goal of finding the optimal buoys placement. Each instance represents wave energy returns for different placements of sixteen buoys.

The attributes in this dataset include the Wave Energy Converters' positions, which range from zero to five hundred sixty-six meters, and their corresponding absorbed power outputs. Additionally, the total power output of the farm is also included as a target feature.

In more detail, the attributes comprise the x and y coordinates of each buoy, ranging from zero to five hundred sixty-six meters, as well as their individual absorbed power outputs. However, these individual power outputs should be disregarded if the total power output of the farm is being considered as the target variable.

This dataset has missing values and is categorized as an expensive optimization problem due to the time-consuming nature of evaluating each farm, which takes several minutes.

The Wave Energy Converters used in this study are fully submerged three-tether converters called CETO, and their positions are optimized in a size-constrained environment. The results were derived using popular and successful evolutionary optimization methods.
