GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be used for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets are valuable for estimating various quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under ROC curve, for classification, feature selection, and clustering algorithms. The repository was created in response to an increasing need in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems. This collection enables researchers to compare different classification and feature selection techniques on a standardized set of problems.

The gene expression samples in the GEMLeR repository originate from the publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository, maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The expO project aims to procure tissue samples under standard conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without intellectual property restrictions, providing direct benefits to patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on several factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the large number of samples available for different tumor types.

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, researchers are encouraged to acknowledge the assistance received from this repository. This acknowledgment helps others obtain the same datasets and replicate experiments. Researchers are also welcome to acknowledge the contribution of the Expression Project for Oncology and the International Genomics Consortium for providing their gene expression samples to the public.

The dataset includes numerous features related to gene expression, represented by various probe set identifiers. These features provide a comprehensive view of gene activity across different samples, enabling researchers to conduct in-depth analyses and develop sophisticated machine learning models for cancer research and other biomedical applications.
