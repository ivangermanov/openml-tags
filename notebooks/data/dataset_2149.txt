This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Insulin Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

The insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes including glucose uptake, fat metabolism, and protein synthesis. It is activated by insulin and insulin-like growth factors, leading to a cascade of downstream signaling events.

In this dataset, the activity values are expressed as pseudo-pCI50, which is a measure of the potency of a compound in inhibiting or activating the insulin receptor.

The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are based on the FCFP6 algorithm, which generates a binary vector representing the presence or absence of particular molecular features.

The insulin receptor is a key therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and related disorders, and QSAR models can be used to predict the activity of novel compounds against this target.
