Data from the RSCTC Two Thousand Ten Discovery Challenge provides example datasets for six different problems of DNA Microarray Data Analysis and Classification. All datasets contain Gene Expression Data characterized by values of attributes. Samples are assigned to several classes. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA Microarrays.

The dataset features a large number of variables, including but not limited to, various gene expressions and measurements. These variables are represented numerically and are used to classify samples into their respective categories.

This dataset is particularly useful for those interested in DNA Microarray Data Analysis and Classification, as well as Gene Expression and Life Sciences.
