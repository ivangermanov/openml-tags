Abstract: This dataset comprises a collection of shape and texture features extracted from digital images of leaf specimens originating from a total of forty different plant species. The data was created using leaf specimens collected at the Faculty of Science, University of Porto, Portugal.

Data Set Information: For further details on this dataset and its attributes, please refer to the 'ReadMe.pdf' file included and consult the Master's Thesis 'Development of a System for Automatic Plant Species Recognition' available at the provided web link.

Attribute Information: The dataset includes various features such as Class (Species), Specimen Number, Eccentricity, Aspect Ratio, Elongation, Solidity, Stochastic Convexity, Isoperimetric Factor, Maximal Indentation Depth, Lobedness, Average Intensity, Average Contrast, Smoothness, Third moment, Uniformity, and Entropy.

This comprehensive collection of leaf data provides valuable information for researchers and scientists studying plant species recognition and classification. The dataset's attributes cover a wide range of shape and texture characteristics, allowing for in-depth analysis of leaf morphology across different plant species. The inclusion of multiple specimens per species enhances the dataset's robustness and applicability in various botanical studies and machine learning applications.
