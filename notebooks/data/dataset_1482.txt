Leaf Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset consists of a collection of shape and texture features extracted from digital images of leaf specimens originating from a total of forty different plant species.

The dataset was created using leaf specimens collected at the Faculty of Science, University of Porto, Portugal.

For further details on this dataset and/or its attributes, please refer to the accompanying ReadMe document and/or consult the Master's Thesis titled Development of a System for Automatic Plant Species Recognition.

Attribute Information:

* Class, which represents the species of the leaf
* Specimen Number, a unique identifier for each specimen
* Eccentricity, a measure of how elliptical the leaf shape is
* Aspect Ratio, the ratio of the leaf's length to its width
* Elongation, a measure of how elongated the leaf shape is
* Solidity, a measure of how much of the leaf's area is occupied by its convex hull
* Stochastic Convexity, a statistical measure of the leaf's convexity
* Isoperimetric Factor, a measure of the leaf's compactness
* Maximal Indentation Depth, a measure of the depth of the leaf's indentations
* Lobedness, a measure of how lobed the leaf shape is
* Average Intensity, a measure of the average brightness of the leaf image
* Average Contrast, a measure of the average contrast between the leaf and its background
* Smoothness, a measure of how smooth the leaf's edges are
* Third Moment, a statistical measure of the leaf's shape
* Uniformity, a measure of how uniform the leaf's texture is
* Entropy, a measure of the randomness of the leaf's texture
