This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tid. It has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fingerprints, and many more.

This dataset is part of the metaqsar project from september two thousand fifteen. It contains qsar data from chembl version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target tid one zero four six one.

Tid one zero four six one is also known as ecdysone receptor. It is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms include twenty-e receptor, twenty-hydroxy-ecdysone receptor, aaeclr, ecdysone receptor, and ecdysteroid receptor.

Organism is aedes aegypti species group. Protein target classification is one point transcription factor slash nuclear receptor slash nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one slash nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group h slash nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group h member one.
