Hazardous Driving Spots Around the World

Tags: Content

This dataset identifies hazardous areas for driving according to harsh braking and accident level events within a specific area. Each month, a new set of dangerous driving areas is produced, encapsulating one year of rolling data. Associated with each area is a severity score that is based on the frequency of occurrences in the area and the severity of said occurrences. The data is aggregated over the previous twelve months.

Some variables to point out include the Severity Score, which represents the number of harsh braking incidents and accident-level incidents for every unit of traffic flow. Traffic flow is defined as the total hourly vehicle volume in the geohash. Additionally, the Incidents Total variable represents the total number of harsh braking incidents and accident-level events that have occurred within the geohash.

Acknowledgements

This dataset is aggregated over the previous twelve months and is updated monthly. This data is publicly available from Geotab.

Inspiration

As some inspiration, consider the following questions: Which countries have the highest number of hazardous spots? Which countries have the least number? Can you create a dynamic geospatial visualization?
