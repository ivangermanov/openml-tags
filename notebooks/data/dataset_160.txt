The problem revolves around Relative CPU Performance Data, which provides valuable insights into the performance characteristics of different machines. For further information, one can refer to the UCI Machine Learning repository.

This dataset includes the following attributes:

Machine Cycle Time, which represents the time taken for a machine cycle in nanoseconds;
Minimum Main Memory, denoting the lowest amount of main memory required in kilobytes;
Maximum Main Memory, indicating the highest amount of main memory available in kilobytes;
Cache Memory, specifying the capacity of cache memory in kilobytes;
Minimum Channels, defining the smallest number of channels in units;
Maximum Channels, indicating the largest number of channels in units; and
Published Relative Performance, serving as the target variable.

This dataset originates from the UCI machine learning repository and was compiled by collecting regression datasets.

Characteristics of this dataset include two hundred nine cases and six continuous variables.
