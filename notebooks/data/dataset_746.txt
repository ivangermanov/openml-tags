Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). 

Features: The dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz through oz, followed by a binary class feature.

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the key change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was accomplished by calculating the mean value of the original target feature, then assigning a positive ('P') classification to all instances below this mean and a negative ('N') classification to all instances above it. The resulting dataset retains the original features but now has a two-class nominal target feature instead of a numeric one. This binarization process allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.
