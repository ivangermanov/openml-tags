SurvBoard-TCGA-BLCA-incomplete Tags: Multi-omics Bladder Cancer Dataset containing incomplete modality samples from the TCGA project.

Features: Patient ID, Overall Survival, Overall Survival Days, Clinical Age at Initial Pathologic Diagnosis, Clinical Gender, Clinical Race, Clinical AJCC Pathologic Tumor Stage, Clinical Clinical Stage, Clinical Histological Type, Gene Expression, and many more.

The dataset contains a wide range of clinical and gene expression features, including patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and molecular profiles. The clinical features provide information on patient outcomes, tumor staging, and histological types, while the gene expression features offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder cancer.

The gene expression features are comprehensive, covering a vast array of genes involved in various biological processes. These features can be used to identify potential biomarkers, understand disease mechanisms, and develop personalized treatment strategies.

This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to advance our understanding of bladder cancer and improve patient outcomes.
