Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version 1). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: Whether or not the Teaching Assistant is a native English speaker, Course instructor, Course, Summer or regular semester, Class size, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Tae, is a modified version of an original dataset with unknown origins. It has been transformed to create a binary classification problem by converting the original multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target. The majority class has been relabeled as positive ('P'), while all other classes have been grouped together as negative ('N'). This binarization process allows for simplified analysis and modeling of the data.

The dataset includes several features related to teaching assistants and course characteristics. These features encompass information about the Teaching Assistant's language background, specifically whether they are a native English speaker or not. Other attributes include details about the course instructor, the specific course being taught, whether the class takes place during the summer or regular semester, and the size of the class. The target variable is now a binary classification, represented by the "Binary Class" feature.

This dataset can be valuable for researchers and data scientists interested in studying factors that may influence teaching effectiveness or student outcomes in higher education settings. It provides an opportunity to explore relationships between various course and instructor characteristics and a binary outcome of interest.
