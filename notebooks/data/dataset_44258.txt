Title of Database: Annealing Data 

Source Information: 

Past Usage: Unknown 

Relevant Information: This dataset was likely left by someone at the 4th Machine Learning Workshop, possibly in nineteen eighty-seven.

Number of Instances: There are eight hundred ninety-eight instances in this dataset.

Number of Attributes: There are thirty-eight attributes in total, consisting of six continuous valued, three integer valued, and twenty-nine nominal valued attributes.

Attribute Information: 
The first attribute is Family, which can take on several values including GB, GK, GS, TN, ZA, ZF, ZH, ZM, and ZS.
The second attribute is Product Type, which can be either C, H, or G.
The third attribute is Steel, which can be one of several types including R, A, U, K, M, S, W, V, or none.
Carbon and Hardness are both continuous valued attributes.
Temper Rolling can be either T or none.
Condition can be S, A, X, or none.
Formability can be rated on a scale from one to five, or none.
Strength is another continuous valued attribute.
Non Ageing can be either N or none.
Surface Finish can be P, M, or none.
Surface Quality can be D, E, F, G, or none.
Enamelability can be rated on a scale from one to five, or none.
The following attributes are all binary, meaning they can be either Yes or No: BC, BF, BT, BWME, BL, M, Chrom, Phos, CBond, Marvi, Exptl, Ferro, Corr, Blue Bright Varn Clean, Lustre, Jurofm, S, and P.
Shape can be either Coil or Sheet.
Thick, Width, and Len are all continuous valued attributes.
Oil can be Yes, No, or Not Applicable.
Bore can be one of several types including 0000, 0500, 0600, or 0760.
Packing can be one of several types including one, two, three, or Not Applicable.

Missing Attribute Values: 
Some attributes have missing values, signified by a question mark.

Distribution of Classes:
There are five classes in total, each representing a different type of annealing process.
