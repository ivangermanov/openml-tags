QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and various FCFP fingerprint bits.

The dataset relates to CaM kinase II alpha, also known as Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha. This is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK family classification.

Associated gene ontology terms include:
Components: nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, dendrite, synapse
Functions: protein kinase activity, calmodulin binding, ATP binding
Processes: protein phosphorylation, calcium ion transport, regulation of neuronal synaptic plasticity

The protein is involved in various signaling pathways such as calcium signaling, RAF/MAP kinase cascade, and interferon signaling. It plays roles in processes like long term potentiation and regulation of neurotransmitter secretion.

Additional information on this target can be found in resources like UniProt, InterPro, PDBe, and Reactome.
