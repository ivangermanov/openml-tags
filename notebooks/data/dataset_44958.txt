**Auction Verification**

**Data Description**
This dataset was created to verify properties of a Simultaneous Multi-Round auction model. The creators of the dataset use Business Process Model and Notation to model the design of the German 4G spectrum auction to sell 800 MHz band. The auction has four bidders and six products. A random budget is assigned from the range one to one hundred to each bidder for each product. A reserve price of three is also defined for all products. Further, each bidder has an individual capacity. Each instance in the dataset represents a simulation of an auction.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset contains attributes that describe the auction process and its outcomes. These attributes include the current capacities of the bidders, the price that is currently verified for a product, the currently verified product, the bidder that is currently verified as winner for a product with a certain price, and the result and time of verifying a property against the underlying Petri Net.

The capacities of the bidders are represented as integers ranging from zero to three. The price that is currently verified for a product is an integer ranging from fifty-nine to ninety. The currently verified product is an integer ranging from one to six. The bidder that is currently verified as winner for a product with a certain price is an integer ranging from one to four. This feature is empty for iterations where the price is not clear yet.
