Auction Verification Dataset

Tags: Machine Learning, Physical Sciences

This dataset was created to verify properties of a Simultaneous Multi-Round auction model. The designers of this dataset used Business Process Model and Notation to model the design of the German Four G Spectrum Auction to sell Eight Hundred MHz band. The auction has Four bidders and Six products. A random budget is assigned from the range One to One Hundred to each bidder for each product. A reserve price of Three is also defined for all products. Furthermore, each bidder has an individual capacity.

Each instance in the dataset represents a simulation of an auction.

The attributes of this dataset include:

Capacity of Bidder One, Capacity of Bidder Two, Capacity of Bidder Three, and Capacity of Bidder Four, which denote the current capacities of the bidders.

Price denotes the price that is currently verified for the product.

Product denotes the currently verified product.

Winner denotes the bidder that is currently verified as winner for the product with the price. This feature is empty for iterations where the price is not clear yet.

Verification Result, which is ignored in this dataset, denotes whether the current property is satisfied in the underlying Petri Net or not.

Verification Time denotes the time in milliseconds for verifying the current property against the underlying Petri Net, which is the target feature.
