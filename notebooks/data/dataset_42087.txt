This dataset, referred to as Beer Reviews, falls under the categories of Machine Learning and Statistics. It comprises a vast collection of beer reviews gathered from Beer Advocate, spanning over ten years and culminating in November of a certain year. Each individual review encompasses ratings based on five distinct aspects of the beer, namely its appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression.

In addition to these ratings, every review provides detailed information about the product itself, as well as the user submitting the review. Furthermore, each review features a comprehensive written assessment of the beer in question. We also possess reviews sourced from Rate Beer.

The dataset boasts an array of features, including the ID and name of the brewery, the time at which the review was submitted, the reviewer's profile name, the style of the beer, its name, and its alcohol by volume percentage.
