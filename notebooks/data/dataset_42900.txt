Tags: **Breast Cancer Coimbra**

The Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset is a collection of data that aims to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer based on ten quantitative predictor variables. These predictor variables consist of anthropometric data and parameters that can be obtained through routine blood analysis.

The dataset contains no missing values and includes ten predictor attributes, namely age in years, body mass index in kilograms per square meter, glucose level in milligrams per deciliter, insulin level in micrograms per milliliter, homeostatic model assessment, leptin level in nanograms per milliliter, adiponectin level in micrograms per milliliter, resistin level in nanograms per milliliter, and monocyte chemoattractant protein one level in picograms per deciliter.

The dataset's primary goal is to develop prediction models that can accurately identify individuals with breast cancer based on these predictor variables. Such models have the potential to serve as biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis.
