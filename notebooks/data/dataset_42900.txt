**Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset**
Tags: **Breast Cancer Coimbra**

This dataset is sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and was published in 2018. It is a collection of breast cancer clinical records.

The Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset consists of ten quantitative predictors and a binary dependent variable, which indicates the presence or absence of breast cancer. The predictors are comprised of anthropometric data and parameters that can be gathered through routine blood analysis. If accurate, prediction models based on these predictors can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer.

**Attribute Information**

The dataset includes the following quantitative attributes:

* Age in years
* Body Mass Index (BMI) in kilograms per square meter
* Glucose levels in milligrams per deciliter
* Insulin levels in micrograms per milliliter
* Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)
* Leptin levels in nanograms per milliliter
* Adiponectin levels in micrograms per milliliter
* Resistin levels in nanograms per milliliter
* Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein One (MCP-1) levels in picograms per deciliter

The labels for the dependent variable are:

* Healthy controls
* Patients

**Additional Information**

This dataset does not contain any missing values. The predictors are a combination of anthropometric data and parameters that can be gathered through routine blood analysis, making them potentially useful as a biomarker of breast cancer if accurate prediction models can be developed.
