AqSolDB is a curated aqueous solubility dataset created by the Autonomous Energy Materials Discovery research group. It consists of aqueous solubility values of unique compounds curated from nine different publicly available aqueous solubility datasets. This openly accessible dataset serves not only as a useful reference source of measured solubility data but also as an improved and generalizable training data source for building data-driven models.

In addition to curated experimental solubility values, AqSolDB also contains relevant topological and physico-chemical two-dimensional descriptors calculated by RDKit. Furthermore, AqSolDB contains validated molecular representations of each of the compounds.

If you use AqSolDB in your study, please cite the following paper published in Nature Scientific Data. Reproducible code can be found on Code Ocean.

The sources of AqSolDB include eChemPortal, the Global Portal to Information on Chemical Substances, as well as several other publications focusing on water solubility estimation and calculation of aqueous solubility of crystalline un-ionized organic chemicals and drugs.

Features of AqSolDB include compound identification information, molecular structure representations, and various physical and chemical properties such as molecular weight, logP, and topological polar surface area.
