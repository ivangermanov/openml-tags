AqSolDB - A Curated Aqueous Solubility Dataset

Context
AqSolDB is created by the Autonomous Energy Materials Discovery research group, consisting of aqueous solubility values of unique compounds curated from publicly available aqueous solubility datasets. This openly accessible dataset, which is the largest of its kind, will not only serve as a useful reference source of measured solubility data but also as a much improved and generalizable training data source for building data-driven models.

Content
In addition to curated experimental solubility values, AqSolDB also contains relevant topological and physicochemical descriptors calculated by RDKit. Additionally, AqSolDB contains validated molecular representations of each of the compounds.
