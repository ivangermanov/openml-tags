Please cite: A four-class version of the breast tissue dataset.

This dataset focuses on breast tissue classification and analysis. It contains multiple features extracted from breast tissue samples, which are used to categorize the tissue into four distinct classes. The dataset is valuable for research in medical diagnostics and tissue characterization. It provides a comprehensive set of measurements that can be utilized for developing and evaluating classification algorithms in the field of breast cancer detection and tissue type identification.

The breast tissue dataset offers a unique opportunity for researchers to explore the relationships between various tissue properties and their corresponding classifications. By analyzing these features, scientists and medical professionals can gain insights into the structural and functional differences among different types of breast tissue, potentially leading to improved diagnostic techniques and treatment strategies.
