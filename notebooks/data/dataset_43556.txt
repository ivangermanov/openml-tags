Running Log Insight Tags: Content

All data was collected via my Garmin GPS watch and uploaded to Garmin Connect via Bluetooth. There are gaps in my log, the largest being from the summer to about spring, when I took a break from running competitively after graduating from college. My GPS watch also has a wrist heart rate monitor, although it is not always accurate. Similarly, occasionally the GPS had some inaccuracies as well, though subjectively I felt this occurred less frequently.

Acknowledgements

Thank you to Garmin Connect for making it easy to export this data and to my legs for their hard work.

Inspiration

Based on my training log data, can you estimate my overall fitness as a function of time? Specifically, when was my fitness maximized? I have a record of when I ran all of my personal records, so that could be a good way to check if you are right.
