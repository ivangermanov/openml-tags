Computing and Predicting Winning Hands in the Trick-Taking Game of Klaverjas, in Proceedings of the Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Klaverjas is an example of the Jack-Nine card games, which are characterized as trick-taking games where the Jack and nine of the trump suit are the highest-ranking trumps, and the tens and aces of other suits are the most valuable cards of these suits. It is played by four players in two teams. This dataset contains the game-theoretic value of almost a million configurations, given perfect play by both teams. It is assumed that player zero starts and that the Diamond suit is trump. Each of the configurations comes from a different equivalence class.

Although the game theoretic value, expressed in the score difference between two teams, constitutes a regression problem, in the attached publication we viewed this as a classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether the starting team will obtain more points than the other team. This is represented in the field outcome. The fields defining which player has a given card, each player having exactly eight cards, are the attributes for the classification problem.

The fields leaf count and time real are meta-data as a result from the alpha-beta-search procedure, and should not be used as predictors. Generating this dataset took a considerable amount of computational power and countless human days for verification of the programs and the results.
