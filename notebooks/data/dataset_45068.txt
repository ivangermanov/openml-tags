The Adult dataset is a prediction task aimed at determining whether an individual earns more than a certain annual income. This dataset was extracted from the Census database using specific conditions to ensure a set of clean records. The conditions included ensuring the individual was of a certain age, had a certain level of annual gross income, and worked a minimum number of hours per week.

The dataset features a range of attributes, including the individual's age, education level, and work experience. It also includes information about their occupation, marital status, and relationship status. Additionally, the dataset provides details about the individual's race, sex, and country of origin.

The ultimate goal of this dataset is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds a certain threshold based on these attributes.
