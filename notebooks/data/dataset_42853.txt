The Letter Dataset is an earth science-related collection of data focused on partial label ranking and transportation features. The primary objective of this dataset is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the twenty-six capital letters in the English alphabet.

The character images were based on twenty different fonts, and each letter within these twenty fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of twenty thousand unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into sixteen primitive numerical attributes, including statistical moments and edge counts, which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from zero through fifteen.

We typically train on the first sixteen thousand items and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining four thousand. 

This dataset does not have any missing values. 

The variables included in this dataset are:

One: Lettr - the capital letter, which has twenty-six values ranging from A to Z
Two: X-Box - the horizontal position of the box 
Three: Y-Box - the vertical position of the box 
Four: Width - the width of the box 
Five: High - the height of the box 
Six: On Pix - the total number of on pixels 
Seven: X-Bar - the mean x of on pixels in the box 
Eight: Y-Bar - the mean y of on pixels in the box 
Nine: X Two Bar - the mean x variance 
Ten: Y Two Bar - the mean y variance 
Eleven: XY-Bar - the mean x y correlation 
Twelve: X Two Y Br - the mean of x times x times y 
Thirteen: XY Two Br - the mean of x times y times y 
Fourteen: X Ege - the mean edge count from left to right 
Fifteen: X Eg Vy - the correlation of x ege with y 
Sixteen: Y Ege - the mean edge count from bottom to top 
Seventeen: Y Eg Vx - the correlation of y ege with x
