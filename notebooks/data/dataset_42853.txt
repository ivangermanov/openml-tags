Letter Tags: Partial Label Ranking

The dataset is designed to identify each of a large number of black and white rectangular pixel displays as one of the twenty-six capital letters in the English alphabet. The character images were based on twenty different fonts, and each letter within these twenty fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of twenty thousand unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into sixteen primitive numerical attributes, which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from zero through fifteen.

The objective is to train a model on a subset of the data and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining data. Typically, the model is trained on the first sixteen thousand items and then used to predict the letter category for the remaining four thousand.

The dataset does not have any missing values.

Additional Variable Information:

The dataset contains seventeen variables, including the capital letter and sixteen primitive numerical attributes. The capital letter variable has twenty-six values, ranging from A to Z. The sixteen primitive numerical attributes include the horizontal position of the box, the vertical position of the box, the width of the box, the height of the box, the total number of on pixels, the mean x of on pixels in the box, the mean y of on pixels in the box, the mean x variance, the mean y variance, the mean x y correlation, the mean of x multiplied by x multiplied by y, the mean of x multiplied by y multiplied by y, the mean edge count from left to right, the correlation of x edge with y, the mean edge count from bottom to top, and the correlation of y edge with x.
