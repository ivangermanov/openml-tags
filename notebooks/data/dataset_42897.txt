Bias Correction Tags: **Dataset**

The Bias Correction of Numerical Prediction Model Temperature Forecast dataset is designed for the purpose of bias correction of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures forecast of the LDAPS model operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration over Seoul, South Korea. This dataset consists of summer data from 2013 to 2017. The input data is largely composed of the LDAPS model's next-day forecast data, in-situ maximum and minimum temperatures of present-day, and geographic auxiliary variables. There are two outputs in this dataset, namely next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures. Hindcast validation was conducted for the period from 2015 to 2017.
