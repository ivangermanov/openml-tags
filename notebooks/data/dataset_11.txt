Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database

This dataset was generated to model psychological experimental results. It is part of the OpenML CC18, OpenML100, and UCI collections, and has been used in various studies and tutorials. The dataset models balance scale phenomena, with each example classified as having the balance scale tip to the right, tip to the left, or remain balanced.

The attributes in the dataset represent the left weight, left distance, right weight, and right distance of the balance scale. The correct classification is determined by comparing the products of weight and distance on each side. If the left side's product (left distance multiplied by left weight) is greater than the right side's product (right distance multiplied by right weight), the scale tips to the left. If the right side's product is greater, the scale tips to the right. When the products are equal, the scale is balanced.

The dataset contains no missing values. The class attribute has three possible values: L (left), B (balanced), and R (right). Each of the four numerical attributes (left weight, left distance, right weight, right distance) can take on five discrete values ranging from one to five.

This dataset has been used in cognitive development research, particularly in modeling how children learn to solve balance scale problems. It provides a simple yet effective way to study decision making processes and the development of mathematical thinking.

The Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database serves as a valuable resource for machine learning practitioners, cognitive scientists, and researchers interested in decision making processes. It offers a straightforward problem with clear rules, making it suitable for various machine learning algorithms and educational purposes.
