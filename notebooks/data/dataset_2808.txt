This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex aud sgd from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent minute relative to the mean high price of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases in the following minute, and false when it decreases or remains unchanged.
