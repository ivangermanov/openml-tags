QSAR-TID-282 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calcium Sensing Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calcium Sensing Receptor. The Calcium Sensing Receptor is a single protein that is also known as CaR, CaSR, CASR, Extracellular Calcium-Sensing Receptor, and hCasR. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family C G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in the ion receptor family.

The Calcium Sensing Receptor is a protein target that is classified as a membrane receptor and is involved in the detection of calcium ions and the regulation of calcium ion transport. It is also involved in various biological processes such as ossification, response to ischemia, and response to metal ions.

The dataset contains information on various compounds that interact with the Calcium Sensing Receptor, including small molecules and proteins. These compounds have different mechanisms of action, such as positive allosteric modulators, antagonists, and agonists. They are involved in various biological processes and have different max phases and first approval dates.

The dataset also contains information on the expression of the Calcium Sensing Receptor in different tissues and cells, including the plasma membrane, cell surface, and basolateral plasma membrane. It is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
