Houses Dataset 

Tags: Classification on Numerical Features 

This dataset was used in the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed accordingly. 

The dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. 

Original Description: 

We collected information on various variables using all block groups in California from the nineteen ninety census. On average, a block group includes individuals living in a geographically compact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. We computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. We excluded all block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. The final data contained observations on nine variables. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of median house value.

The analysis revealed several key relationships between the variables. For instance, there is a strong positive correlation between median income and median house value. Additionally, the natural logarithm of median age also has a significant impact on median house value. Furthermore, the natural logarithm of total rooms per population and bedrooms per population are also important factors influencing median house value. Lastly, the natural logarithm of population per households and households have a negative and positive effect respectively on median house value.
