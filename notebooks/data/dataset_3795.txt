QSAR-TID-14073 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14073. The dataset has twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14073. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The dataset is related to the Human Herpesvirus One Protease, which is a single protein target. The preferred name of this target is Human Herpesvirus One Protease, and it has several synonyms, including Assemblin, Assembly Protein, Capsid Assembly Protein, Capsid Protein P40, and Capsid Scaffolding Protein. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, viral process, viral release from host cell, and nuclear capsid assembly.
