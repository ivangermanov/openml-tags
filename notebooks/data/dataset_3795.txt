This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Human Herpesvirus One Protease, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Zero Two Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many others, including FCFP Six One Zero Two Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive resource for QSAR models and datasets. It was created in September Two Thousand Fifteen.

The target protein, Human Herpesvirus One Protease, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the life cycle of the virus. It is responsible for cleaving the viral polyprotein into individual proteins, which is necessary for the assembly of new viral particles.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers developing QSAR models for this important drug target.
