Insurance Bayesian Network Sample Eight

This Insurance Bayesian Network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository and is characterized by twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, resulting in one thousand eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point one nine, while the average degree is around three point eight five. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network was developed based on adaptive probabilistic networks with hidden variables. It is designed to model complex relationships between various factors influencing insurance policies. 

Features of this network include driving history, driving skill, age, ruggedness of the automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft devices, driver quality, risk aversion, good student discounts, other cars, make and model, accidents, socioeconomic status, home base, property cost, car value, anti-lock brakes, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft, airbags, medical costs, senior training, and cushioning.
