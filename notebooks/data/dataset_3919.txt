QSAR-TID-10785 Dataset Information:

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10785. It has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Dataset Source:
The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

Dataset Citation:
Please cite this dataset when used.
