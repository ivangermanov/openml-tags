The QSAR-TID-271 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 271. This dataset has 576 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The data was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The dataset is related to the government and MTLQSAR study three.

The Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta-1 is a single protein and its preferred name is Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta-1. It also has synonyms such as c-erbA-2, c-erbA-beta, ERBA2, NR1A2, and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group A Member 2. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and its protein target classification is Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily 1/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily 1 Group A/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily 1 Group A Member 2.

There are three parent molecules in this dataset: Eprotirome, Resmetirom, and MB07811. These molecules are small molecules and they have a mechanism of action as Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta-1 agonists.

The Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta-1 has various functions and processes associated with it, such as chromatin binding, DNA binding, metal ion binding, nuclear receptor activity, protein binding, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of heart contraction, retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway, retinal cone cell development, sensory perception of sound, and type I pneumocyte differentiation.
