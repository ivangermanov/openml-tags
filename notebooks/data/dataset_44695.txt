Subsampling of the dataset Satellite with seed equals two arguments n rows max equals two thousand arguments n columns max equals one hundred arguments n classes max equals ten arguments no stratify equals true generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters such as seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and whether to use stratification or not, and returns a dataset.

It first gets the unique values of the target variable, and if there are more than the specified number of classes maximum, it selects a specified number of classes using their value counts as probabilities.

Then, it gets the indices where one of these classes is present, and filters the data using these indices.

Next, it checks if the number of columns exceeds the specified number of columns maximum, and if so, it uniformly samples the columns.

Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the specified number of rows maximum, it uses stratified sampling to get the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset is then returned, with the categorical mask and column names preserved.
