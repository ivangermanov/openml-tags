Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Satellite with seed equals two arguments n rows equals two thousand arguments n columns equals one hundred arguments n classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals false

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of columns uniformly at random. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data.
