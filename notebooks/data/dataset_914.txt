The Mouse Type dataset belongs to the categories of Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset contains a range of samples, characterized by various attributes, which represent measurements from DNA microarrays. The number of samples varies from one hundred to four hundred, while the number of attributes ranges from twenty thousand to sixty-five thousand.

Each sample in this dataset is assigned to multiple classes, ranging from two to ten. All attributes in this dataset are numeric and have been normalized in some way, ensuring that the distribution of attribute values remains consistent throughout the dataset.

The Mouse Type dataset was sourced from the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge, where it was made available for public use. Further information about this dataset can be accessed through the challenge website.
