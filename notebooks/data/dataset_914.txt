Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, likely used for mythbusting and study purposes. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification task. This was accomplished by calculating the mean value of the target variable and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean threshold, respectively.

The dataset's origin and creation date are unknown, but it appears to be derived from a previous version of a related dataset. Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset are encouraged to provide proper citation.

The features included in this dataset comprise an identifier, raw data, and the binarized class label. This transformation from a continuous regression problem to a discrete classification task may facilitate certain types of analysis or machine learning applications.
