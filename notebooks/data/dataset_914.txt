The Balloon Dataset 

This dataset is a binarized regression problem related to chemistry and life science, also known for its role in myth-busting. A study was conducted to convert the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

This dataset contains features such as identification and raw data.
