The Wind dataset contains daily average wind speeds recorded from the early to late sixties at multiple synoptic meteorological stations in the Republic of Ireland. These data were thoroughly analyzed in a published article focusing on space-time modeling with long-memory dependence, specifically assessing Ireland's wind power resource.

Each data point represents one day and includes the year, month, day, and average wind speed measurements from twelve different stations. The stations are listed in a specific order as depicted in a figure from the original study. The data are provided in knots rather than meters per second.

The dataset has been made available for unlimited distribution, with a request to report any anomalies to a specified email address. Potential users should be aware that the dataset is quite large, over half a megabyte in size, and should consider this before requesting access.

The dataset is classified as numeric, with no specific class index. It includes features such as year, month, day, and wind speed measurements from various stations. The wind speed data from these stations could potentially be used for various meteorological studies, climate analysis, or renewable energy assessments.

Given the nature and scope of the data, it could be valuable for researchers interested in long-term wind patterns, climate change studies, or renewable energy potential in Ireland. The extensive time period covered and the multiple measurement locations provide a comprehensive view of wind behavior across the country.
