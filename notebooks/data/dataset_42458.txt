Experiment Data Obtained by Running Random Configurations of Ranger Through MLR on Classification Tasks from OpenML.

The experiment involves running multiple random configurations of the ranger algorithm through the machine learning platform MLR on a diverse range of classification tasks sourced from OpenML. 

Each configuration was tested on one hundred nineteen different datasets, with the performance metrics recorded for each run. 

The key characteristics of each configuration include the identification of the task, the name of the dataset used, the learner model employed, the mean misclassification error and log loss performance measures, the time taken to train and predict the model, and various parameters related to the ranger algorithm itself.

These parameters encompass the number of imputed values selected using the conditional parameter optimization method, the total number of decision trees generated, whether sampling was performed with replacement, the fraction of samples used, whether unordered factors were respected, the minimum node size, the rule used to determine splits, the number of random splits considered, and the number of input features tried at each split.
