Name: San Francisco Police Incidents Seed Four 

Tags: Education, Machine Learning 

Subsampling of the dataset San Francisco Police Incidents with seed equal to four, arguments number rows max equal to two thousand, arguments number columns max equal to one hundred, arguments number classes max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

A function named subsample takes five parameters: self, seed, number rows max, number columns max, number classes max, and stratified. The function uses numpy random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects a uniform sample of classes from the unique values in the target variable, ensuring the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. The function then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uniformly samples columns and subsets the data. Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data, ensuring the class distribution is preserved.

The function returns a dataset object containing the subsampled data, along with metadata such as column names and categorical mask.

Features: Hour of the day, day of the week, month, year, police district, address, and type of crime.
