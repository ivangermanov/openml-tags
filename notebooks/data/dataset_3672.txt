This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101404, belongs to the categories of Life Science, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR, and is part of the MetaQSAR project from September 2015.

It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101404, with a total of one hundred twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

This dataset is related to the single protein preferred name serine threonine protein kinase RIO one, also known as RIO kinase one, belonging to the species group of Homo sapiens, with a protein target classification of enzyme kinase protein kinase atypical protein kinase group atypical protein kinase RIO family atypical protein kinase RIO one subfamily.

It has descriptions and relationships with accession number Q nine B R S two, and is involved in various biological processes such as phosphorylation, maturation of SSU-rRNA, ribosome biogenesis, ribosomal small subunit biogenesis, and positive regulation of rRNA processing.

Keywords: QSAR, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, MetaQSAR, Drug Target, Serine Threonine Protein Kinase, RIO Kinase, Ribosome Biogenesis, Phosphorylation.
