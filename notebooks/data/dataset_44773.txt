Name: sf police incidents seed zero

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset sf police incidents generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its overall characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample. 

The function first selects a subset of classes, ensuring that the most common classes are included. It then selects the corresponding rows from the dataset. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum, it randomly selects a subset of columns. Finally, if the number of rows still exceeds the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows.

The resulting dataset is returned, along with its characteristics, including the categorical mask and column names.
