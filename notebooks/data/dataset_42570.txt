Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car, was invented in eighteen eighty-six, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include, for example, the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for a large number of patents every year, making the brand the European leader among premium car makers.

Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams. To ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, engineers have developed a robust testing system. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for so many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.

As one of the world's biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on production lines. In this competition, Daimler is challenging competitors to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Competitors will work with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler's high standards.

This dataset contains an anonymized set of variables, each representing a custom feature in a Mercedes car. For example, a variable could represent four-wheel drive, added air suspension, or a head-up display. The ground truth is labeled and represents the time that the car took to pass testing for each variable.
