This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calcium-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase Alpha, and it has eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI50. 

The features represent Fingerprint Circular Fragmentation Patterns one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information about the drug target, specifically its synonyms, which include Calcium-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase One, Calcium-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Four Kinase, and Calcium-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase One Alpha. It also includes information about the species group, specifically Homo sapiens, and the protein target classification, specifically enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, other protein kinase group, other protein kinase calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase family, and other protein kinase meta subfamily.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about the expression atlas, gene ontology component, gene ontology function, gene ontology process, Wikipedia, canSAR-target, guide to pharmacology, intact, pharmGKB, pharos, reactome, uniprot, interpro, pfam, and pdbE.
