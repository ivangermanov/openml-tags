QSAR-TID-103446 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103446. The dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103446. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 103446, which is a cyclin-dependent kinase-like three protein.

The dataset contains information about the protein target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The protein target is a cyclin-dependent kinase-like three protein, which is a single protein target classified under the category of protein kinases.

The dataset also contains information about the protein's function, including its role in various biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, negative regulation of axon extension, protein modification process, positive regulation of dendrite morphogenesis, regulation of cell cycle, and dendrite extension.
