Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Instance, Sex, Treatment, Grade, Age, Condition, Site, T, N, Entry, Status, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on pharyngeal conditions and has been processed to create a binary classification problem. The original numeric target variable has been transformed into a two-class nominal feature based on the mean value. Instances below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are labeled as negative. This binarization allows for simplified analysis and mythbusting studies related to pharyngeal conditions. The dataset includes various features such as patient demographics, treatment information, and disease characteristics, enabling comprehensive research on pharyngeal health outcomes.
