The QSAR-TID-30049 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand forty-nine. This dataset has seven hundred thirty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

The features represent Fingerprint-Based Circular Fingerprints (FCFP) molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL identifier and median pseudo-pIC50. The molecule ChEMBL identifier is a unique identifier for each molecule in the dataset, while the median pseudo-pIC50 represents the activity value of each compound on the drug target.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand forty-nine.

The drug target, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Five, is a single protein that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group, specifically the STE protein kinase group. It is involved in various biological processes, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase activity, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.
