QSAR-TID-12829 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12829. The dataset has 543 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the compounds, including their molecular structure, activity values, and other relevant features. The activity values are expressed in terms of pseudo-pCI50, which is a measure of the compound's potency in inhibiting the target protein.

The features in the dataset are represented by a set of molecular fingerprints, which are a way of encoding the molecular structure of a compound into a numerical representation. This allows for the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and make predictions about the activity of new compounds.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on the development of new drugs targeting Cyclin-dependent kinase 7, a protein that plays a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle.
