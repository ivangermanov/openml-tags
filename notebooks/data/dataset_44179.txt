Data shows the downlink goodput for unicast and multicast transmissions with different group sizes and network loads on an IEEE 802.11ac network simulated on NS-3. This dataset explores the performance of various IEEE 802.11aa Group Address Translation Services (GATS) in different scenarios.

The dataset features include multicast mode, number of multicast stations, number of unicast stations, injected multicast traffic, injected unicast downlink traffic, injected unicast uplink real traffic, network occupancy, uplink occupancy, downlink occupancy, average downlink data rate, average uplink data rate, downlink multicast delay, downlink unicast delay, uplink delay, goodput for downlink unicast, goodput for downlink multicast, goodput for uplink, downlink retransmission share, uplink retransmission share, total goodput, normalized goodput for downlink unicast, normalized goodput for downlink multicast, normalized goodput for uplink, and normalized total goodput.

Keywords: IEEE 802.11ac, NS-3, Group Address Translation Services, multicast, unicast, network performance, goodput, delay, retransmission.
