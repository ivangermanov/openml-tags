QSAR-TID-10958 Dataset: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10958. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha is a single protein preferred name, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group C Member One. It is a transcription factor and nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes.

The receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of glucose and lipid metabolism. It is activated by fatty acids and their derivatives, leading to the induction of genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport.

In addition to its role in metabolic regulation, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha is also implicated in various physiological processes, including heart development, epidermis development, and wound healing.
