This dataset covers features from various categories of technical indicators, futures contracts, price of commodities, important indices of markets around the world, price of major companies in the United States market, and treasury bill rates. The dataset only contains information from the NASDAQ.

The features include date, close, volume, momentum, rate of change, exponential moving average, dollar bond average, oil prices, gold prices, and currency exchange rates, among others. The dataset also includes features related to major companies such as Apple, Amazon, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Wells Fargo, ExxonMobil, and others.

The dataset is based on a research paper titled "CNNpred: CNN-based Stock Market Prediction Using a Diverse Set of Variables." 

HTRU Two is a dataset that describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. Pulsars are a rare type of neutron star that produce radio emission detectable on earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter.

As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, producing a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus, pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes. Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation.

A potential signal detection known as a candidate is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional information, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However, in practice, almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.

Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted, treating the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. Here, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples are the majority negative class.

The dataset contains sixteen thousand two hundred fifty-nine spurious examples caused by radio frequency interference and noise, and one thousand six hundred thirty-nine real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. 

Each candidate is described by eight continuous variables and a single class variable. The first four are simple statistics obtained from the integrated pulse profile, including mean, standard deviation, excess kurtosis, and skewness. The remaining four variables are similarly obtained from the dispersion measure signal-to-noise ratio curve, including mean, standard deviation, excess kurtosis, and skewness.
