Name: Road Safety Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Road Safety with seed equals one

This dataset is a subsample of the original Road Safety dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling the unique classes present in the dataset, with a maximum limit of ten classes. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the rows where one of these classes was present.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled, with a maximum limit of one hundred columns. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset with the reduced number of columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled, with a maximum limit of two thousand rows. This was done using stratified sampling, which ensures that the resulting dataset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of various features, including vehicle information, driver details, location data, and casualty information. These features are essential for analyzing and understanding road safety patterns and trends.
