Name: Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its overall characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, as well as a flag for stratified sampling.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are representative of the original dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, selecting a specified number of columns at random. If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function stratifies the data and samples a subset of rows, ensuring that the sampled data is representative of the original dataset.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, including the categorical mask and column names.
