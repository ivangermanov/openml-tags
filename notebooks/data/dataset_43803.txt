Chernobyl Air Concentration

Tags: Context

The Chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on a fateful day in April 1986 at the Number Four nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located near the city of Pripyat in the northern region of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. It is widely regarded as the worst nuclear disaster in recorded history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at the maximum severity level of seven on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan.

This dataset presents the concentration of Iodine-131, Caesium-134, and Caesium-137 as aerosol particles, which were meticulously measured in specific locations and dates. On each line, the following information is provided: country code, locality name, latitude in degrees and hundredths of degrees, longitude in degrees and hundredths of degrees, date in year, month, and day, hour of end of sampling in hours and minutes, duration in hours and minutes, Iodine-131 concentration in Becquerels per cubic meter, Caesium-134 concentration in Becquerels per cubic meter, and Caesium-137 concentration in Becquerels per cubic meter.
