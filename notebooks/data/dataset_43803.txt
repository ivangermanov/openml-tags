The Chernobyl Air Concentration dataset is a collection of measurements taken during the worst nuclear disaster in history, which occurred on April twenty-sixth, nineteen eighty-six, at the Number Four nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located near the city of Pripyat in the northern part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

This dataset presents the concentration of three radioactive isotopes - Iodine One Thirty-One, Caesium One Thirty-Four, and Caesium One Thirty-Seven - as aerosol particles, measured in specific locations and dates. Each entry provides detailed information about the measurement, including:

* Country code
* Locality name
* Latitude and longitude coordinates
* Date and time of measurement
* Hour of end of sampling
* Duration of sampling
* Concentrations of Iodine One Thirty-One, Caesium One Thirty-Four, and Caesium One Thirty-Seven in Becquerels per cubic meter (aerosol particles)

Acknowledgments: The data was extracted from the REM data bank at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra.

In terms of inspiration, this dataset can be used to identify areas where the air was most polluted during the Chernobyl disaster.
