Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model, origin, binary class

This dataset is a modified version of the original Auto MPG dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involves calculating the mean of the target variable and then categorizing instances into two classes based on their relation to this mean value. Instances falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are labeled as negative. This binarization allows for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques to the automotive fuel efficiency data.

The dataset retains several key features from the original, including information about the vehicle's cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. These attributes provide a comprehensive view of each vehicle's characteristics, which can be used to predict its fuel efficiency classification.

By converting the continuous target variable into a binary format, this dataset enables researchers and data scientists to explore classification problems related to automotive efficiency. It serves as a valuable resource for studies in machine learning, data mining, and pattern recognition within the context of vehicle performance and environmental impact.
