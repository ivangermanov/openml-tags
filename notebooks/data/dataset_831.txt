The binarized version of the original dataset has undergone significant transformations. Specifically, the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion involved re-labeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

Features include aspects related to vehicle characteristics, such as buying habits, maintenance costs, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety ratings.
