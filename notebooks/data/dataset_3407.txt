The QSAR-TID-11977 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, and it has forty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, also known as proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src, is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase superfamily and plays a key role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

The dataset includes features such as molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the structure of molecules, and activity values, which measure the effect of compounds on the drug target.

The drug target, Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell survival. It is also implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders.

The dataset can be used to develop machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds on the drug target and to identify potential leads for drug discovery.
