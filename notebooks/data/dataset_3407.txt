QSAR-TID-11977 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the protein target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src, which is a single protein and a proto-oncogene. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cell cycle, and cell migration. The protein is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, protein phosphorylation, and protein binding.

The dataset provides information about the protein's function, process, and component, including its role in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion. It is also involved in various biological processes, including immune system process, cell cycle, and cell adhesion.

The protein is known to interact with various other proteins, including insulin receptor, integrin, and ephrin receptor. It is also involved in various signaling pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling pathway.
