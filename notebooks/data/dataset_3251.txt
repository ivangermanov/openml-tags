QSAR-TID-12967 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12967. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. This particular dataset is from September 2015 and contains data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The features in this dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints can be used to predict the activity of compounds on a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop predictive models of drug activity, as well as for those who want to understand the relationships between molecular structure and activity.

Keywords: QSAR data, drug target, molecular fingerprints, predictive models, drug activity.
