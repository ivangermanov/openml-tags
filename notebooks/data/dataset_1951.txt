The QSAR-TID-104430 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 104430. This dataset has forty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

This dataset contains information about a single protein preferred named Neuropeptides B/W Receptor Type One, also known as Gpr Seven G-Protein Coupled Receptor Seven Neuropeptides B/W Receptor Type One Npbwr One. It belongs to the species group Mus Musculus.

The protein target classification is one point zero Membrane Receptor Family A G-Protein Coupled Receptor Peptide Receptor Family A GPCR Short Peptide Receptor Family A GPCR Neuropeptide Receptor.

This protein is described to be involved in signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, and regulation of metabolic process. It has relationships with plasma membrane, membrane, and neuron projection.
