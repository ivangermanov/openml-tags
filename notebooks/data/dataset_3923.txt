MetaQSAR Dataset: QSAR-TID-20110
Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Statistics, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20110. It consists of fifty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide high-quality QSAR datasets for machine learning and statistical modeling applications.

Scraped Data:

The protein target classification is Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase ten, also known as c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase three. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus.

The protein target classification is described as being involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, protein phosphorylation, JNK cascade, JUN phosphorylation, response to light stimulus, phosphorylation, regulation of circadian rhythm, locomotor rhythm, rhythmic process, cellular hyperosmotic response, neurotransmitter receptor transport to postsynaptic membrane, and vesicle-mediated transport in synapse.
