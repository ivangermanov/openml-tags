German Credit Data
Tags: Physical Sciences, Transportation

The original dataset contains entries representing individuals who have taken out a credit from a bank. Each individual is classified as either a good or bad credit risk based on a set of attributes.

The dataset was initially difficult to comprehend due to its complex system of categories and symbols. To make it more accessible, a Python script was written to convert it into a readable CSV file. The original column names, which were in German, were replaced with English names during the processing stage.

The attributes and their details in English are as follows:
