The QSAR-TID-10811 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically designed for studying demographics and molecular transformations. This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10811. It consists of one thousand four hundred eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about Rho-associated protein kinase one, also known as p one sixty ROCK one, Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN thirty-five, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase one, and Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase I. It belongs to the single protein type and is classified under the enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, AGC protein kinase group, AGC protein kinase DMPK family, and AGC protein kinase ROCK subfamily.

This protein is primarily found in Homo sapiens species and is involved in various biological processes, including mitotic cytokinesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, aortic valve morphogenesis, apical constriction, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, smooth muscle contraction, organelle organization, leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and many others.

It is also associated with various components, such as Golgi membrane, ruffle, extracellular region, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, centriole, cytosol, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, cytoplasmic stress granule, membrane, lamellipodium, bleb, secretory granule lumen, cell projection, Schaffer collateral - CA one synapse, and amyloid-beta complex.

Keywords: QSAR, demographics, molecular transformations, Rho-associated protein kinase, protein kinase, AGC protein kinase, biological processes, signal transduction.
