The Multiple Features Dataset: Fourier is one of a set of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Each dataset corresponds to the same original characters, with two thousand instances in total.

The attribute information represents seventy-six Fourier coefficients of the character shapes. 

This dataset is part of a larger collection of datasets, each featuring a different type of attribute information. These include profile correlations, Karhunen-Love coefficients, pixel averages, Zernike moments, and morphological features. 

The dataset has been used in various studies and papers, including one on handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers and another on statistical pattern recognition. 

The features of this dataset are:

attribute one, attribute two, ..., attribute seventy-six, class

The dataset consists of features of handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Two hundred patterns per class have been digitized in binary images.
