Multiple Features Dataset: Factors

This dataset is one of a set of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (zero through nine) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. A substantial number of instances per class have been digitized in binary images, totaling several thousand instances.

The attributes represent numerous profile correlations. No additional information is known about these specific attributes.

The dataset as it exists has been utilized in various research papers focusing on statistical pattern recognition and handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers. These studies have explored the application of different classification techniques to the multiple feature sets provided by this and related datasets.

The complete dataset consists of features of handwritten numerals extracted from Dutch utility maps. These digits are represented in terms of six distinct feature sets:

- Fourier coefficients of the character shapes
- Profile correlations
- Karhunen-Lo√®ve coefficients
- Pixel averages in small windows
- Zernike moments
- Morphological features

In each file, the patterns are stored in ASCII format, with each line representing a single pattern. The patterns are grouped by class, with equal numbers of patterns for each numeral from zero to nine.

It's worth noting that the source image dataset has been lost. However, using the pixel dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained at a resolution of fifteen by sixteen pixels.

This dataset does not contain any missing values, making it suitable for various machine learning and pattern recognition tasks without the need for extensive data cleaning or imputation.

The multiple feature sets provided allow for comprehensive analysis of handwritten digit recognition, enabling researchers to compare and combine different feature extraction techniques for improved classification accuracy.
