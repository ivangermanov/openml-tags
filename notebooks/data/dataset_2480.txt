**Wilt Data Set**

This data set contains training and testing data from a remote sensing study that involved detecting diseased trees in high-resolution Quickbird imagery. The study had a small number of training samples for the diseased trees class and a large number for the other land cover class. The testing data set was obtained through a stratified random sample of the image.

The data set consists of image segments generated by segmenting the pansharpened image. These segments contain spectral information from the Quickbird multispectral image bands and texture information from the panchromatic image band.

The data set is particularly useful for researchers interested in remote sensing, machine learning, and life science applications. It provides an opportunity to develop and test classification models on a challenging data set with an imbalanced class distribution.

**Data Set Information**

This data set is part of a larger study on detecting diseased trees using remote sensing technology. The study involved collecting high-resolution Quickbird imagery and extracting features from the images using various techniques. The resulting data set contains a range of features, including spectral and texture information, which can be used to classify image segments into different classes.

**Attribute Information**

The data set includes several attributes, including:

* Class: This attribute indicates whether the image segment corresponds to diseased trees or all other land cover.
* GLCM Pan: This attribute represents the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix mean texture feature extracted from the panchromatic image band.
* Mean Green Value: This attribute represents the average green value of the image segment.
* Mean Red Value: This attribute represents the average red value of the image segment.
* Mean Near-Infrared Value: This attribute represents the average near-infrared value of the image segment.
* Standard Deviation Pan: This attribute represents the standard deviation of the panchromatic image band.
