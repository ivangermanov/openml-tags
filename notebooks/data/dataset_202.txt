1985 Auto Imports Database 

This dataset consists of three types of entities: the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, its assigned insurance risk rating, and its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. 

The dataset was created based on several sources including the 1985 Model Import Car and Truck Specifications, Ward's Automotive Yearbook, Personal Auto Manuals, Insurance Services Office, and Insurance Collision Report, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

In the past, this dataset has been used to predict the price of cars using all numeric and boolean attributes. An instance-based learning algorithm derived from a localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used to compare with a linear regression prediction. All instances with missing attribute values were discarded, resulting in a training set of 159 instances, which was also used as a test set minus the actual instance during testing.

The results showed a percent average deviation error of prediction from actual of 11.84% for the instance-based learning algorithm and 14.12% for the resulting linear regression equation.

This dataset contains twenty-six attributes, fifteen of which are continuous, one is an integer, and ten are nominal. The attributes include symboling, normalized losses, make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, peak RPM, city MPG, highway MPG, and price.

The dataset contains 205 instances, and several of the attributes in the database could be used as a class attribute. Horsepower is treated as the class attribute.
