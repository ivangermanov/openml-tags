This dataset addresses a control problem, specifically flying an F sixteen aircraft. The attributes describe the status of the airplane, while the ultimate goal is to accurately predict the necessary control action required for the ailerons of the aircraft.

Features include various aspects of the plane's performance, such as its rate of climb, speed, pitch, roll, and other relevant metrics.

The dataset aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between these factors, enabling the development of more effective control systems for aircraft.
