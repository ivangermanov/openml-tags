Auto Horse Dataset

Tags: Automotive, Machine Learning, Prediction

This dataset consists of information about various automobile characteristics, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses compared to other cars. The insurance risk rating indicates how risky a car is relative to its price, with values ranging from -3 (safer) to +3 (riskier). Normalized losses represent the average loss payment per insured vehicle year, adjusted for vehicle size classification.

The data includes specifications for numerous car makes and models, covering attributes such as fuel type, aspiration, body style, engine characteristics, and performance metrics. There are 205 instances in the dataset, with 26 attributes in total. These attributes are a mix of continuous, integer, and nominal data types.

Some key attributes include symboling (risk factor), normalized losses, make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, and price.

The dataset has been used in various studies, including instance based prediction of real valued attributes and comparisons with linear regression models. It's worth noting that several attributes could potentially be used as class attributes for different prediction tasks.

There are some missing values in the dataset, particularly for attributes such as normalized losses, number of doors, bore, stroke, horsepower, peak rpm, and price. These missing values are denoted by "?" in the original data.

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of automobile characteristics and associated risk factors, making it valuable for various machine learning and statistical analysis tasks in the automotive industry.
