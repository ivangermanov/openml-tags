Soybean Dataset: Chemistry, Life Science 

This binarized version of the original dataset converts the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('Positive') and all others as negative ('Negative'). 

The dataset includes various features related to the growth and development of soybeans, including environmental factors, physical characteristics, and signs of disease or damage. These features provide valuable information for understanding the complex interactions between soybeans and their environment.

Features include Date, Plant Stand, Precipitation, Temperature, Hail, Crop History, Area Damaged, Severity, Seed Treatment, Germination, Plant Growth, Leaves, Leaf Spots, Stem, Lodging, Stem Cankers, Fruiting Bodies, External Decay, Mycelium, Internal Discoloration, Sclerotia, Fruit Pods, Fruit Spots, Seed, Mold Growth, Seed Discoloration, Seed Size, Shriveling, Roots, and Binary Class.

Keywords: Soybean, Chemistry, Life Science, Environmental Factors, Physical Characteristics, Disease, Damage.
