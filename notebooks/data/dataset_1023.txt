Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: date, plant stand, precipitation, temperature, hail, crop history, area damaged, severity, seed treatment, germination, plant growth, leaves, leafspots halo, leafspots margin, leafspot size, leaf shredding, leaf malformation, leaf mildew, stem, lodging, stem cankers, canker lesion, fruiting bodies, external decay, mycelium, internal discoloration, sclerotia, fruit pods, fruit spots, seed, mold growth, seed discoloration, seed size, shriveling, roots, binary class

This dataset focuses on soybean plant characteristics and various environmental factors affecting their growth and health. It includes information on plant structure, disease symptoms, and external conditions. The data has been modified from its original multi-class format to a binary classification problem, simplifying the target variable. This transformation allows for easier analysis and modeling of soybean-related issues. The features cover a wide range of attributes, from weather conditions to specific plant symptoms, providing a comprehensive view of soybean cultivation challenges.
