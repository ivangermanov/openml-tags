QSAR-TID-12263 Dataset Information

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12263. It consists of forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty.
