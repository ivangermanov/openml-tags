This dataset is part of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. It contains data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. The data is derived from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 1970s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes various metrics such as McCabe's line count of code, cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, design complexity, Halstead metrics (total operators and operands, volume, program length, difficulty, intelligence, effort, time estimator), line counts (code, comments, blank lines), unique operators and operands, total operators and operands, branch count of the flow graph, and a binary indicator of whether the module has reported defects.

Relevant Papers:
Several studies have been conducted using this dataset, including analyses of data quality in NASA software defect datasets, evaluations of blind spot sampling policies in software engineering, and assessments of software defect predictors. These studies have contributed to the field of software quality assurance and defect prediction.

The KC1 dataset provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners in software engineering, particularly those focused on defect prediction and software quality metrics. It offers a comprehensive set of code metrics that can be used to develop and evaluate models for identifying potentially defective software modules.
