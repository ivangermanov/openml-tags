This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically the study three, and it was created in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, which is a single protein preferred name nociceptin receptor, also known as kappa-type three opioid receptor, KOR-three, nociceptin receptor, OOR, and OPRL one.

The nociceptin receptor is a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor, specifically an opioid receptor. It is classified under one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. The description of this receptor includes its relationship, accession, and various components, functions, and processes.

The components include plasma membrane, membrane, and cytoplasmic vesicle. The functions involve nociceptin receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and G protein-coupled opioid receptor activity. The processes encompass signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, behavior, sensory perception of pain, and G protein-coupled opioid receptor signaling pathway.
