QSAR-TID-11631 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11631. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1255 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features are FCFP6 1024, which are molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-1, which is a protein target involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and signal transduction.

The Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-1 is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. It is also involved in the regulation of bone mineralization and resorption, as well as the transmission of nerve impulses.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new therapeutic agents targeting the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-1. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization, among other applications.
