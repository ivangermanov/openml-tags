The QSAR-TID-238 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 238. This dataset has one thousand three hundred fifty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

Features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset shows activity values, unit is pseudo-pCI50, of several compounds on drug target TID: 238.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
