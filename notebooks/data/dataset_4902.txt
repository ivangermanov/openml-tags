**Alarm Bayesian Network**

The Alarm Bayesian network is a discrete-medium sized network repository referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. This network consists of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with five hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, while the average degree is approximately two point four nine, with a maximum in-degree of four.

The Alarm Bayesian network is a case study featuring two probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. It was originally presented in the Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.

This network features several variables, including disconnect, insufficient anesthesia, pulmonary artery pressure, history, arterial carbon dioxide, error in cauterization, heart rate blood pressure, oxygen, blood pressure, ventilation machine, ventilation tube, catecholamine, cardiac output, intubation, error in low output, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, minimum volume set, total peripheral resistance, central venous pressure, ventilation lung, anaphylaxis, pulse oximetry saturation, minimum volume, expected carbon dioxide, heart rate saturation, left ventricular failure, hypovolemia, heart rate electrocardiogram, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, systemic arterial oxygen saturation, pulmonary embolism, heart rate, ventilation alveoli, stroke volume, and kinked tube.
