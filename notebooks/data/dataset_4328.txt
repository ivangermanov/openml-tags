The Credit Seed Two N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True dataset is a subsampled version of the Credit dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. This dataset is particularly useful in the fields of Manufacturing and Statistics.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed ten. The selected classes were chosen based on their value counts, with a higher probability of selection given to classes with a larger count. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the data.

Next, the column count was reduced to one hundred by uniformly sampling column indices. The selected columns were chosen randomly, ensuring that the resulting dataset had the desired number of columns.

Finally, the row count was reduced to two thousand by stratified sampling, taking into account the class distribution of the data. This ensured that the resulting dataset maintained an accurate representation of the original data.

The features of this dataset include Revolving Utilization of Unsecured Lines, Age, Debt Ratio, Monthly Income, and Number of Dependents.
