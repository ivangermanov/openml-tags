QSAR-TID-248 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane-A Synthase, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane-A Synthase. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Thromboxane-A Synthase is a single protein, also known as CYP5, CYP5A1, Cytochrome P450 5A1, Hydroperoxy Icosatetraenoate Dehydratase, and is an enzyme that belongs to the Cytochrome P450 family five, subfamily A, polypeptide one. It is involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and is a target for the treatment of various diseases.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it for research purposes.
