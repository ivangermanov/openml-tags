This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane-A Synthase, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, followed by multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.
