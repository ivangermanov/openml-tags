This dataset contains comprehensive information about real estate listings across the United States, including active listings, prices, days on market, price changes, and pending listings by county.

The median listing price refers to the middle value of all listing prices within a specific geographic area during a particular month. The active listing count represents the total number of for-sale properties on the market, excluding pending listings where a pending status is available. This provides a snapshot of the number of active listings that can be expected on any given day of the specified month.

The median days on market indicate the average number of days property listings spend on the market within a specific geographic area during a particular month. Time spent on the market is defined as the period between the initial listing of a property and either its closing date or the date it is taken off the market.

The new listing count represents the number of new listings added to the market within a specific geographic area. This count typically reflects a week's worth of new listings in a given month. To obtain a monthly new listing count, multiply the weekly count by the number of weeks in the month.

The price increase count indicates the number of listings that have had their price increased within a specific geographic area. Similar to the new listing count, this count typically reflects a week's worth of listings with price increases in a given month. Multiply the weekly count by the number of weeks in the month to obtain a monthly price increase count.

The pending listing count represents the total number of pending listings within a specific geographic area during a particular month, if a pending definition is available for that area. This provides a snapshot of the number of pending listings that can be expected on any given day of the specified month.
