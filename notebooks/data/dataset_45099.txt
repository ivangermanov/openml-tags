Prostate Dataset, a Microarray Dataset

The Prostate dataset is a microarray dataset consisting of 102 instances. This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying gene expression correlates of clinical prostate cancer behavior.

The dataset features a wide range of genes, including those related to inflammation, immune response, and cell signaling. These genes are represented by their corresponding probe set IDs, which are used to identify and quantify their expression levels.

The dataset is a result of a comprehensive study on gene expression profiles of prostate cancer tissues, aiming to identify genes that are associated with clinical behavior. The study employed a microarray platform to analyze the expression levels of thousands of genes in prostate cancer samples.

The Prostate dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression and behavior. It has the potential to facilitate the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease.
