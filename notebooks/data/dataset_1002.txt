Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

This dataset contains various demographic and socioeconomic features related to individuals and households. The features include information on housing, family structure, education, employment, income, and migration. The target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem, simplifying the original multi-class structure.

The data encompasses a wide range of attributes, such as housing type, farm status, property ownership, family composition, parental presence, educational attainment, employment status, income sources, poverty status, and veteran status. These features provide a comprehensive view of individuals' living situations and socioeconomic circumstances.

Researchers and analysts can utilize this dataset for various studies related to social sciences, economics, and demographic trends. The binary classification target allows for straightforward predictive modeling and analysis of factors influencing the positive or negative outcomes.
