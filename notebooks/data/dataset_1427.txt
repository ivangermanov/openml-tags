Name: Adult Dataset
Tags: LibSVM, Adult Income Prediction

This dataset originates from the LIBSVM data repository and is focused on predicting adult income levels. The original Adult dataset contained fourteen features, comprising six continuous and eight categorical variables. In this version, the continuous features have been discretized into quantiles, with each quantile represented by a binary feature. Additionally, categorical features with multiple categories have been converted into separate binary features for each category.

The preprocessing details for each feature conversion can be found at the beginning of the relevant files on the associated webpage. The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks related to income prediction.

The features in this dataset cover various demographic and socioeconomic attributes, though they have been anonymized and are represented as generic attribute names. The total number of features exceeds one hundred due to the binary encoding of categorical variables and discretization of continuous variables.

This dataset is widely used in machine learning research and applications, particularly for studying income prediction models and demographic analysis. It serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating classification algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to cite the UCI Machine Learning Repository when using this dataset in their work. The dataset provides valuable insights into the relationships between various personal and professional attributes and income levels, making it a useful resource for socioeconomic studies and predictive modeling in the field of data science.
