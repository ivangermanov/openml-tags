Shuttle 

Tags: Demographics, Education 

Data Set Information:
The majority of the data, approximately eighty percent, belongs to Class One. As a result, the default accuracy is roughly eighty percent. The primary objective is to achieve an accuracy of ninety-nine to ninety-nine point nine percent.

The examples in the original dataset were initially in chronological order, which could potentially be significant in classification. However, this temporal aspect was deemed irrelevant for StatLog purposes. Consequently, the order of the examples in the original dataset was randomized, and a portion of the original dataset was removed for validation purposes.

Attribute Information:
The Shuttle dataset comprises nine attributes, all of which are numerical. The first attribute represents time. The last column denotes the class, which has been encoded as follows: Rad Flow, Fpv Close, Fpv Open, High, Bypass, Bpv Close, and Bpv Open.
