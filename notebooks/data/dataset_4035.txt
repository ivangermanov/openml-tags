This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one fourteen ninety-nine, and it has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pxc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systems BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.

The drug target is Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase two, which is also known as aminoacylproline aminopeptidase, membrane-bound aminopeptidase P, and membrane-bound APP. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MG clan, and metallo protease M twenty-four B subfamily.

The protein target classification is one point enzyme, and its description is related to the protein function of breaking peptide bonds. The dataset provides information about the protein target, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description.

In addition to the protein target information, the dataset also provides information about the gene ontology component, gene ontology function, gene ontology process, Wikipedia, canSAR-target, CGD, guide to pharmacology, IntAct, pharm GKB, Pharos, reactome, and UniProt.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug target, Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase, enzyme, protease, metallo protease, MetaQSAR project.
