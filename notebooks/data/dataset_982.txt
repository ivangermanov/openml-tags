Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion was originally performed by an individual researcher.

This dataset contains various medical and physiological features related to heart health. The features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. The target variable is a binary class indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

The dataset is intended for use in mythbusting and various studies related to heart conditions. It provides a simplified, binary classification problem derived from a more complex multi-class dataset, making it suitable for certain types of analysis and machine learning tasks focused on heart disease prediction.
