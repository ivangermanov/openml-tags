QSAR-TID-10402 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10402. The dataset has sixty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Bradykinin B2 receptor is a single protein, also known as B2 bradykinin receptor, B2R, Bdkrb2, and BK-2 receptor. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The receptor is also involved in various cellular components, including endosome, plasma membrane, and membrane. It has various molecular functions, including protease binding, G protein-coupled receptor activity, bradykinin receptor activity, protein binding, and beta-2 adrenergic receptor binding.
