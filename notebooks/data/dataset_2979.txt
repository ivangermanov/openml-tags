UCI Student Performance Mat Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, which were collected using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese Language.

The dataset regards the performance in Mathematics. An important note is that the target attribute Final Grade has a strong correlation with the First Period Grade and Second Period Grade. This occurs because the Final Grade is issued at the third period, while the First Period Grade and Second Period Grade correspond to the first and second period grades. It is more difficult to predict the Final Grade without the First Period Grade and Second Period Grade, but such prediction is much more useful.
