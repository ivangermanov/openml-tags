Name: Robert Seed Two Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Robert with seed equals two, arguments nrows equals two thousand, arguments ncols equals one hundred, arguments nclasses equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It does this by first uniformly sampling classes from the target variable, then uniformly sampling columns from the feature variables, and finally uniformly sampling rows from the resulting dataset. The function also ensures that the subsample is stratified according to the target variable.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable and selects a subset of these classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the feature variables.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the feature variables, selecting a subset of columns based on their index. It then subsets the feature variables using these selected columns.

Finally, the function uniformly samples rows from the resulting dataset, using the stratify argument to ensure that the sample is representative of the original dataset.

The function returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original, with the same structure and attributes as the original dataset.
