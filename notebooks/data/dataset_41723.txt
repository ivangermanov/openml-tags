**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the FOREX CAD/CHF currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one hour. The dataset spans from January to December and does not include weekends, as the FOREX market is not traded on weekends. The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam.

The class attribute is the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following hour, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. This means the class attribute is True when the mean High price is going up the following hour, and the class attribute is False when the mean High price is going down or stays the same the following hour.
