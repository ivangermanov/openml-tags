Padding Attack Dataset - Damn Vulnerable OpenSSL - Twenty Twenty Three April Twenty Eighth

Tags: Bleichenbacher Padding Attack

Attribute Names:

This dataset was created on Twenty Twenty Three April Twenty Eighth using the server Damn Vulnerable OpenSSL.

The dataset contains attributes related to TCP packets, including source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, and timestamp.

Additionally, the dataset includes attributes related to TLS records, such as record content type, record length, alert message level, and alert message description.

Furthermore, the dataset contains attributes related to three specific packets, labeled TLS Zero, Disconnect Zero, and Disconnect One, which include various TCP and TLS-related attributes.

Vulnerable Classes:

This dataset includes examples of five different types of vulnerabilities, including incorrect PKCS#1 padding, missing zero bytes, incorrectly formatted PKCS#1 messages, and incorrect first and second bytes.

Features:

Label, Source Port, Destination Port, Port, Stream, Length, Sequence Number, Next Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, Header Length, Flags, Window Size Value, Window Size, Window Size Scale Factor, Checksum Status, Urgent Pointer, Options, Timestamp, Record Content Type, Record Length, Alert Message Level, Alert Message Description, Order, and many others.
