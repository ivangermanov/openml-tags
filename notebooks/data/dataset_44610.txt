Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratified argument determines whether the sampling should be stratified or not.

The function starts by getting the unique classes in the dataset and selecting a random subset of them. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to select the corresponding rows and columns from the dataset. Next, it selects a random subset of columns and uses these columns to select the corresponding data from the dataset. Finally, it selects a random subset of rows and uses these rows to select the corresponding data from the dataset.

The function returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original dataset. The new dataset has the same structure as the original dataset, but with a smaller number of rows, columns, and classes.
