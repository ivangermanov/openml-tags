Win95pts Bayesian Network. Sample 3.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online. This network consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively high, indicating complex relationships between variables. The average degree of the nodes is moderate, with some nodes having a higher in-degree than others.

The network features several notable variables, including Print Port, Network Print, Print Data, and Printer Status Off. Other important variables include Printer Driver, Printer File, and Printer Thread. The network also includes variables related to printer settings, such as Paper Orientation OK and Printer Offline.

Additionally, the network incorporates variables related to system performance, including Available Virtual Memory and Application OK. It also features variables related to printing quality, such as Graphics Related Driver Settings and PostScript Graphic.
