US Breweries

While brainstorming ideas for a statistics project for a course, the idea of utilizing data about microbreweries emerged as a promising concept. Unfortunately, after some exploration and careful consideration, we ultimately decided to scrap the idea, but I am left with this valuable data to share.

The data was acquired from Beer Month Club, a reputable online platform, and contains comprehensive information about breweries listed on the site as of October first, two thousand nineteen. The dataset includes essential details such as the brewery's name, type of brewery, physical address, official website, and state location.

The code utilized to scrape this data is publicly available on GitHub, providing transparency and reproducibility.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Beer Month Club for permitting the scraping of their brewpub section, thereby enabling the collection of this valuable data.

This dataset, although interesting in its own right, holds even greater potential when combined with other sources of information, such as Yelp reviews or the number of links to a brewery's website, thereby opening up avenues for more in-depth analysis projects.
