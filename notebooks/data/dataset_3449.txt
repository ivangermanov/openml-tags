The Prostanoid EP3 Receptor 

The Prostanoid EP3 Receptor is a single protein, also known as the Prostaglandin E2 Receptor EP3 Subtype, PGE2-R, PGE2 Receptor EP3 Subtype, Prostaglandin E2 Receptor EP3 Subtype, and Prostanoid EP3 Receptor. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and prostanoid receptor.

The Prostanoid EP3 Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory responses, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentrations, cell death, intestine smooth muscle contraction, positive regulation of fever generation, and negative regulation of gastric acid secretion.
