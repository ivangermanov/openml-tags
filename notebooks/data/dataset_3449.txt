QSAR-TID-10329 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10329. The dataset has 669 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The Prostanoid EP3 receptor is a single protein target, also known as the Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3 subtype. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor group and is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and cell death.

The receptor is activated by prostanoid EP3 receptor agonists, such as Misoprostol and Sepetaprost, which are small molecules that bind to the receptor and trigger a response. The receptor is also involved in various diseases, including gastric acid secretion and fever generation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Prostanoid EP3 receptor.
