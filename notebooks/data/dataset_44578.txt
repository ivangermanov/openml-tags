Diabetes One Thirty US 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Diabetes One Thirty US dataset, containing two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The sampling process was performed using a uniform distribution across classes, ensuring an equal representation of each class. 

The dataset contains various features related to patients' demographics, medical history, and treatment outcomes. These features include encounter ID, patient number, race, gender, age, weight, admission type, discharge disposition, admission source, time spent in hospital, payer code, medical specialty, laboratory procedures, number of procedures, medications, outpatient visits, emergency visits, inpatient visits, diagnoses, glucose serum levels, A1C results, and medication types.

To generate this dataset, a random number generator was used to select classes, columns, and rows. The selection process ensured that the resulting dataset maintains a balanced representation of classes.
