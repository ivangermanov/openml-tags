The Electrical Discharge Machining dataset represents a two-target regression problem. The task is to shorten the machining time by reproducing the behavior of an expert operator who controls the values of two variables. Each of the target variables takes on three distinct numeric values, and there are sixteen continuous input variables. The goal is to model the relationship between these inputs and outputs, allowing for more efficient machining processes.

The dataset consists of various features that describe the machining process, including measures of mean time and standard deviation for different aspects of the process. By analyzing these features, machine learning models can learn to predict the optimal settings for the two target variables, leading to reduced machining times and improved overall efficiency.
