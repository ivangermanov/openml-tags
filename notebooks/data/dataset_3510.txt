Drug Classification Tags: Context 

Since I am a beginner in machine learning, it would be a great opportunity to try some techniques to predict the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for the patient.

The target feature is the drug type. 

The feature sets are age, sex, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and sodium to potassium ratio. 

The main problem lies not just in the feature sets and target sets but also in the approach that is taken in solving these types of problems as a beginner. Therefore, the best of luck is wished.

Features: age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, drug

Keywords: drug classification, machine learning, prediction, accuracy, patient care, feature extraction, target feature.
