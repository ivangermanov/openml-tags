QSAR-TID-12910 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12910. The dataset has 326 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a set of numerical values. These fingerprints can be used to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a valuable resource for identifying potential lead compounds and optimizing their activity against specific drug targets.

The Neurotensin Receptor 1 is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including temperature homeostasis, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, and modulation of pain perception. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, glutamate secretion, and gamma-aminobutyric acid secretion.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the activity of various compounds against the Neurotensin Receptor 1, which can be used to identify potential lead compounds and optimize their activity.
