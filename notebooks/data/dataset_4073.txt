QSAR-TID-17023 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17023. The dataset has eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17023. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Ecdysone receptor, a single protein target that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression.

The Ecdysone receptor is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. It is involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription and is activated by the binding of ecdysone, a steroid hormone. The receptor is composed of several domains, including a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, which are responsible for its transcriptional activity.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in the development of QSAR models for the Ecdysone receptor. The FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints provide a detailed description of the molecular structure of the compounds, which can be used to develop predictive models of their activity.
