Wine Recognition Data

Title of Database: Wine Recognition Data

This database is an updated version, last modified on September 21, 1998, with added attribute information.

The sources of this database are from various places, including the Institute of Pharmaceutical and Food Analysis and Technologies in Genoa, Italy, and James Cook University of North Queensland.

Past usage of this database includes comparisons of classifiers in high-dimensional settings, where the classes are separable, although only one method, Regularized Discriminant Analysis, has achieved one hundred percent correct classification. This makes it a good dataset for initially testing new classifiers, but it may not be particularly challenging.

The relevant information about this dataset is that it consists of the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of thirteen constituents found in each of the three types of wines. Although the initial dataset had around thirty variables, only thirteen dimensions are included in this version. Unfortunately, the list of the original thirty variables was lost, making it impossible to determine which thirteen variables are included in the current set.

The attributes of the dataset include alcohol, malic acid, ash, alkalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, non-flavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, optical density two eighty over optical density three fifteen of diluted wines, and proline.

There are one hundred seventy-eight instances in total, divided into three classes: fifty-nine instances of class one, seventy-one instances of class two, and forty-eight instances of class three.

Each attribute is continuous, and there are no missing values. It is suggested that the variables be standardized for certain uses, such as with classifiers that are not scale-invariant.

Class distribution is as follows: class one has fifty-nine instances, class two has seventy-one instances, and class three has forty-eight instances.
