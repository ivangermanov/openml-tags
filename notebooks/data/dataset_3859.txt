QSAR-TID-125 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 125. The dataset has 1425 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation, heart rate, and smooth muscle contraction. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is activated by the binding of adrenergic agonists, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine.

The dataset contains a list of compounds with their corresponding activity values, which can be used to train machine learning models for predicting the activity of new compounds. The features of the dataset include molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that encodes the structural information of a molecule.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on the development of new drugs targeting the Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor. The dataset can be used to identify new lead compounds, optimize existing compounds, and understand the structure-activity relationships of the receptor.
