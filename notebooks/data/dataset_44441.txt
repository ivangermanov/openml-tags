Name: Eye Movements Seed Three 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is defined to take in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. 

The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of classes from the unique classes in the dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. 

The function then selects the indices where one of the selected classes is present and filters the data accordingly. 

If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, the function uniformly samples columns to reduce the dimensionality. 

Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data according to the target variable and samples a subset of rows.
