Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements with Seed Three 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Eye Movements dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the resulting dataset has a maximum number of ten classes. 

The subsampled dataset was then further reduced by uniformly sampling columns, limiting the number of columns to one hundred. Finally, the dataset was reduced again by randomly selecting a specified number of rows while maintaining the stratification of the data. 

This process resulted in a dataset with a carefully controlled balance of classes and features. The features included in this dataset are related to eye movements, including fixation durations, saccade lengths, and pupil diameters. These features are important for understanding how humans process visual information.
