**Pigs Bayesian Network. Sample Zero**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference provides access to this network.

This network consists of four hundred forty-one nodes and five hundred ninety-two arcs, resulting in five thousand six hundred eighteen parameters.

The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point sixty-six, while the average degree is two point sixty-eight. The maximum in-degree is two.

Some notable features include production levels, pig weights, feed types, and health status.

This dataset is particularly useful for those working in manufacturing and machine learning, specifically in the context of pig farming and agricultural production.
