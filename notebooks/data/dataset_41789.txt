**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex EUR NZD pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute signifies the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent minute compared to the mean high price of the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases in the following minute, and false when the mean high price decreases or remains unchanged.
