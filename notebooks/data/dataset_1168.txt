We consider the problem of scheduling tasks on multiple servers, each with limited capacity for central processing unit, memory, and input/output attributes. These tasks have specific durations, earliest start times, and latest end times, as well as resource requirements for central processing unit, memory, and input/output attributes. The tasks can be scheduled on any of the multiple servers, as long as the total resource consumption does not exceed the server's capacity.

All tasks must be completed within their specified time frames, which do not extend beyond midnight between two consecutive days. Once a task is started, it cannot be interrupted and must run for its entire duration. Furthermore, if a server is utilized by a task, it must be operational during that time.

In addition to the costs associated with running the allocated tasks, the server also consumes idle power when it is turned on. There are also startup and shutdown costs incurred every time a server is powered on or off. At the beginning and end of the planning period, all servers are turned off.

The electricity price for the data center varies throughout the day and is unknown in advance. A forecast is used to generate a schedule, and the actual cost is determined after the fact by applying the real-time electricity price to the energy consumption in each time period. A single forecast of the price is provided, but there may be significant discrepancies between the forecast and actual prices, allowing for opportunities to create more accurate forecasts using historical data on demand and prices, as well as prior forecast information. It is important to note that a highly accurate forecast does not necessarily guarantee a low-cost schedule.

In the forecasting problem, we aim to predict the actual electricity price for the next day based on historical and forecasted data. Historical data is available from September 2011 onward, with missing values denoted by question marks.

The data includes various fields, including date and time, holiday information, day of the week, week of the year, day, month, year, half-hour period of the day, forecasted wind production, national load forecast, price forecast, actual temperature, actual wind speed, carbon dioxide intensity, actual wind energy production, actual national system load, and actual price.
