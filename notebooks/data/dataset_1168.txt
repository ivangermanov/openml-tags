The electricity prices ICON dataset focuses on a cloud computing service scheduling problem. Customers contract to run computing tasks with specific durations, start/end times, and resource requirements for CPU, memory, and I/O. These tasks must be scheduled on multiple servers with limited capacities, allowing concurrent execution if total resource consumption remains below capacity. Tasks cannot be interrupted once started and must run within their release and due dates, not extending past midnight.

Machines consume idle power when on and incur startup and shutdown costs. All machines begin and end the planning period in an off state. Electricity prices for the data center vary in real-time throughout the day, requiring the use of forecasts for scheduling. The total cost is determined after applying actual prices to energy consumption in each time period.

The forecast problem involves predicting electricity prices one day in advance using historical and forecasted data from September onwards. Data fields include date and time, holiday information, day of week, week of year, day, month, year, period of day, forecasted wind production, national load forecast, price forecast, temperature and windspeed measurements, CO intensity, actual wind production, actual system load, and actual price.

The challenge offers opportunities to generate improved forecasts based on historical demand, prices, and previous forecast information. However, a low-error forecast does not guarantee a low-cost schedule. The dataset provides a comprehensive set of features for analysis and prediction, with some fields only available for historical data.

This problem combines elements of resource scheduling, energy management, and price forecasting in a cloud computing context. It requires balancing task execution requirements with fluctuating electricity prices to optimize overall operational costs.
