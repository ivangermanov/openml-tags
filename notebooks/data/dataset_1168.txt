The Steel Plates Faults Data Set is a collection of data related to steel plates' faults, categorized into seven distinct types. The primary objective of this dataset was to train machine learning models for automatic pattern recognition. This dataset comprises twenty-seven features that describe each fault, including location and size, as well as seven binary features that indicate the type of fault.

These binary features include Pastry, Z Scratch, K Scratch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, and Other Faults. The latter is often used as a binary classification target, distinguishing between common and other faults.

Attribute information includes:

* X Minimum
* X Maximum
* Y Minimum
* Y Maximum
* Pixels Areas
* X Perimeter

* Sum of Luminosity
* Minimum of Luminosity
* Maximum of Luminosity
* Length of Conveyer
* Type of Steel A Three Hundred
* Type of Steel A Four Hundred
* Steel Plate Thickness
* Edges Index
* Empty Index
* Square Index
* Outside X Index
* Edges X Index
* Edges Y Index
