**QSAR-TID-101333**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101333. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by multiple FCFP6 1024 bit molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is related to the government and MTLQSAR study three.

**Scraped Data:**

The protein target is Interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, also known as EIF2AK2, eIF-2A protein kinase 2, Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group/other protein kinase PEK family/other protein kinase PKR.

The protein target is involved in various cellular components, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, ribosome, membrane, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm. It is associated with multiple molecular functions, such as nucleotide binding, RNA binding, double-stranded RNA binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein phosphatase regulator activity.

The protein target participates in multiple biological processes, including positive regulation of cytokine production, immune system process, translation, protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, response to virus, regulation of translational initiation by eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, phosphorylation, negative regulation of translation, endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response, positive regulation of chemokine production, positive regulation of stress-activated MAPK cascade, negative regulation of osteoblast proliferation, cellular response to amino acid starvation, response to interferon-alpha, negative regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of MAPK cascade, negative regulation of viral genome replication, innate immune response, protein autophosphorylation, positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity, defense response to virus, antiviral innate immune response, regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly, positive regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling, regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, and regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation.
