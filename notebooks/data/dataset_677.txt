This is a binarized version of the original dataset, which involves converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process is achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

The features included in this dataset are temperature, various molecular properties, and chemical bond characteristics. These features aim to describe the chemical structure and properties of molecules, which are crucial in understanding their behavior and interactions.
