The imagery was collected on June twelfth, nineteen ninety-two and represents a two point nine by two point nine kilometer area in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, USA. 

Please cite: Data contains the information of samples from spectral bands. The classes represent land-use types: alfalfa, corn, grass, hay, oats, soybeans, trees, and wheat.

Features: 

The dataset represents a land-use classification problem, where the goal is to identify the type of land use based on the spectral information. The dataset is composed of a large number of samples, each representing a specific area of land, and a large number of spectral bands, which provide information about the reflectance of the land at different wavelengths. The classes in the dataset represent different types of land use, including crops such as alfalfa, corn, oats, soybeans, and wheat, as well as natural areas such as grass and trees.
