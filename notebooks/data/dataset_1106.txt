Multiclass Cancer Diagnosis Using Tumor Gene Expression Signatures.

This dataset focuses on multiclass cancer diagnosis using sixteen thousand sixty-three tumor gene expression signatures. The study aims to develop an approach for diagnosing multiple types of cancer based on gene expression profiles.

The dataset consists of various gene expression signatures obtained from tumors. These signatures serve as features, which are used to train machine learning models for cancer diagnosis.

The approach involves training models on a subset of the data and testing them on the remaining instances. This process enables the evaluation of the model's performance in diagnosing different types of cancer.

Features:
Gene expression levels of various genes, including housekeeping genes and other control genes.
