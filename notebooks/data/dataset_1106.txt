This dataset, known as GCM, contains gene expression signatures from tumor samples used for multiclass cancer diagnosis. The data is split into training and testing sets, with the first instances used for training. The features consist of numerous gene expression measurements, represented by various probe set identifiers. These measurements provide a comprehensive profile of gene activity in cancer cells, enabling the classification of different cancer types based on their molecular signatures. The study aims to improve cancer diagnosis and potentially inform treatment strategies by leveraging the distinct gene expression patterns associated with various cancer types.
