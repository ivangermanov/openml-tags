Name: PDGFR
Tags: Drug design dataset

This is one of several drug design datasets. The datasets with numerous features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset contains information related to PDGFR inhibitors. It is derived from a study on the development of linear, ensemble, and non-linear models for predicting and interpreting the biological activity of PDGFR inhibitors.

Other datasets in this collection cover various topics in medicinal chemistry and drug design, including:

- Carbolenes
- Melting point prediction
- Neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity validation  
- Benzodiazepine receptor ligands
- Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR)
- Polyaromatic hydrocarbons
- Toxicity prediction
- Biodegradability of chemical compounds
- Structure-function relationships of modified proteins
- Antifilarial antimycin analogues

The datasets utilize different molecular descriptors and statistical methods to model various properties and activities of chemical compounds. They represent a diverse range of applications in drug discovery, toxicology, and chemical informatics.
