This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: seventeen thousand twenty-one, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: seventeen thousand twenty-one.
