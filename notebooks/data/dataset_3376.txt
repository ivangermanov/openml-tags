The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game. In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features, or attributes, that measure different aspects of the instance. In this case, there are four attributes that describe the weather conditions: the outlook, which could be sunny, cloudy, or rainy; the temperature, which is measured in degrees; the humidity, which indicates how damp the air is; and whether it is windy or not. The outcome is whether these conditions are suitable for playing the game or not.

Features: outlook, temperature, humidity, windy, play
