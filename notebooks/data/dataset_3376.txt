QSAR-TID-12186 Dataset: Machine Learning, Manufacturing, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12186. It has twenty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and various fingerprint features.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it for your research purposes.
