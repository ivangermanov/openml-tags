The QSAR-TID-101411 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101411. This dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The drug target is a single protein, also known as Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase ULK One. It is an enzyme, specifically a protein kinase, involved in various cellular processes such as autophagy, protein phosphorylation, and signal transduction.

Autophagy is a catabolic process in which cells recycle damaged or dysfunctional cellular components, such as proteins and organelles. ULK One plays a crucial role in the initiation of autophagy by phosphorylating and activating other proteins involved in this process.

The dataset is annotated with various terms from Gene Ontology, including biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. These annotations provide insights into the functions and localizations of ULK One and its interactions with other proteins.

In addition to Gene Ontology, the dataset is also annotated with terms from other databases, such as UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam, providing further information about the structure and function of ULK One.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase ULK One, autophagy, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, Gene Ontology, molecular fingerprints.
