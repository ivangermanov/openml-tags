QSAR-TID-101411 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101411. The dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the target TID: 101411.

The target TID: 101411 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase, also known as ULK1, which plays a crucial role in autophagy and cell signaling. It is involved in various biological processes, including autophagosome assembly, protein phosphorylation, and signal transduction.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for this target, which can aid in the discovery of new drugs and therapies.
