The Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset is originally from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The primary goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can diagnose whether a patient has chronic kidney disease or not, based on various diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

This dataset comprises several medical predictor variables and one target variable, which is the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. The predictor variables include blood pressure, albumin levels, and other relevant medical factors. 

The inspiration behind this project is to design a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether patients in the dataset have chronic kidney disease or not. 

Features of interest include blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin levels, sugar levels, red blood cell count, blood urea levels, serum creatinine levels, sodium levels, potassium levels, hemoglobin levels, white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and hypertension status.
