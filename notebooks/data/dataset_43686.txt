The Chronic Kidney Disease dataset is originally from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The primary objective of this dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient is suffering from chronic kidney disease or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, which is the Class. The predictor variables include Blood Pressure, Albumin, and other relevant medical factors. 

The inspiration behind this dataset is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have chronic kidney disease or not, based on these medical predictor variables.

The dataset features a range of medical variables, including Blood Pressure, Serum Glomerular Filtration Rate, Albumin, Sugar, Red Blood Cell Count, Blood Urea, Serum Creatinine, Sodium, Potassium, Hemoglobin, White Blood Cell Count, and Red Blood Cell Count, as well as a variable indicating whether the patient has Hypertension.
