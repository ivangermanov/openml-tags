Iris Tags: This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. The Iris dataset is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains three classes of instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

The instances in this dataset represent individual plants. 

The Iris dataset is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and is widely used in statistics and machine learning. The data set contains three classes of instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain.

The Iris dataset differs from the original data presented in the article. The corrected data has been identified and the errors have been noted. 

This dataset does not have any missing values.
