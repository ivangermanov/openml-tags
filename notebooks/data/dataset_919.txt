Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involves calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This binarization technique simplifies the original numeric data into a more straightforward two-class problem, potentially making it easier to analyze or apply certain machine learning algorithms.

The dataset likely contains multiple columns of data, with the final column representing the binary classification outcome. Researchers and data scientists may find this binarized version useful for various studies, particularly those involving binary classification tasks or comparative analyses between numeric and categorical target variables.
