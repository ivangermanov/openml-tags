The Various Cancers Final dataset is categorized under Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset contains multiple samples, each characterized by numerous attributes representing measurements from DNA microarrays. The attributes are numeric and have been normalized in some manner, resulting in similar distributions of attribute values across the example data and test data.

All datasets encompass between one hundred and four hundred samples, each described by twenty thousand to sixty-five thousand attributes. These samples are assigned to multiple classes, ranging from two to ten. 

The source of this dataset is the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge, which provides detailed information about the dataset.
