This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10983, is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10983. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the chembl database, specifically version seventeen. It contains information about the neurokinin three receptor, also known as the neurokinin b receptor, neuromedin-k receptor, nk-three r, and nk-three receptor nkr.

The neurokinin three receptor is a single protein that belongs to the family a g protein-coupled receptor, specifically the peptide receptor family. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in signal transduction, particularly in the g protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and tachykinin receptor signaling pathway.

Additionally, this receptor is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of heart rate, response to estradiol, regulation of dopamine metabolic process, response to cocaine, positive regulation of blood pressure, regulation of feeding behavior, and regulation of uterine smooth muscle contraction.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, neurokinin three receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, tachykinin receptor signaling pathway.
