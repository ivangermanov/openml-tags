QSAR-TID-10983 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10983. The dataset has rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin Three Receptor. The Neurokinin Three Receptor is a single protein, also known as Neurokinin B Receptor, Neuromedin-K Receptor, NK-Three R, and NK-Three Receptor. It belongs to the species Rattus norvegicus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The Neurokinin Three Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, tachykinin receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of heart rate, response to estradiol, regulation of dopamine metabolic process, response to cocaine, positive regulation of blood pressure, regulation of feeding behavior, regulation of uterine smooth muscle contraction, and positive regulation of flagellated sperm motility.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction of drug-target interactions.
