German Credit Risk 
Tags: Context 

The original dataset, known as German Credit Risk, contains one thousand entries with twenty categorical and symbolic attributes. In this dataset, each entry represents an individual who has taken out a credit from a bank. Each individual is classified as a good or bad credit risk based on the set of attributes.

It is extremely challenging to comprehend the original dataset due to its intricate system of categories and symbols. As a result, a Python script was written to convert it into a readable Comma Separated Values file. Several columns were deliberately omitted since, in the writer's opinion, they were either deemed unimportant or had obscure descriptions. 

The selected attributes include Age, which is a numeric value; Sex, which is categorized as male or female; Job, which is categorized numerically as unskilled and non-resident, unskilled and resident, skilled, or highly skilled; Housing, which is categorized as own, rent, or free; Saving Accounts, which are categorized as little, moderate, quite rich, or rich; Checking Account, which is a numeric value expressed in Deutsche Marks; Credit Amount, which is also a numeric value expressed in Deutsche Marks; Duration, which is a numeric value expressed in months; and Purpose, which is categorized as car, furniture or equipment, radio or television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, or vacation and others.
