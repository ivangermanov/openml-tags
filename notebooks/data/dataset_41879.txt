**Data Description**

This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex GBP/USD pair obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one hourly candlestick, with the entire dataset spanning from January to December. Since Forex markets do not operate on weekends, these days are excluded from the data.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent hour relative to the mean high price of the current hour. Specifically, the class attribute assumes a value of True when the mean high price is anticipated to rise in the forthcoming hour and False when it is expected to decline or remain stagnant.
