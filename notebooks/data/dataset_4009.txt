Diabetes Dataset 
================

The Diabetes dataset is a collection of ten baseline variables, including age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, obtained for each of the diabetes patients, along with the response of interest, which is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Data Set Characteristics**

This dataset consists of a total number of instances and a number of attributes. The first ten columns contain numeric predictive values, while the eleventh column represents the target variable, which is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Attribute Information**

Each attribute in this dataset has been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation. The attributes include age in years, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol divided by High-Density Lipoprotein, logarithm of serum triglycerides level, and blood sugar level.

**Source**
This dataset was sourced from a study on Least Angle Regression, which aimed to identify the most important predictors of disease progression in diabetes patients.
