QSAR-TID-163 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. It is a key regulator of gene expression and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, survival, and metabolism.

The receptor is activated by fatty acids and eicosanoids, which bind to the ligand-binding domain, leading to the recruitment of coactivator proteins and the transcriptional activation of target genes.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha, which can be used for the discovery of new drugs and the optimization of existing ones.
