Bike Sharing Demand

Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on categorical and numerical features" benchmark.

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process, from membership to rental and return, has become fully automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular location and return it at another location. Currently, there are numerous bike-sharing programs around the world, comprising hundreds of thousands of bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their significant role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health-related issues. Apart from their fascinating real-world applications, the characteristics of the data generated by these systems make them appealing for research purposes.

Unlike other transportation services, such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature transforms bike-sharing systems into a virtual sensor network capable of detecting mobility within cities. As a result, it is anticipated that most significant events within cities could be identified through monitoring this data.

The bike-sharing rental process is heavily influenced by environmental and seasonal factors. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and time of day can all impact rental behavior. 

The core dataset relates to the two-year historical log corresponding to years from the Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly available. We aggregated the data on an hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information was obtained from relevant sources.

Attributes:

* Season: the time of year 
* Year 
* Month 
* Hour 
* Holiday: whether the day is a holiday or not 
* Weekday: the day of the week 
* Working Day: if the day is neither a weekend nor a holiday, it is one; otherwise, it is zero.
* Weather Situation 
* Temperature: normalized temperature in Celsius 
* Feeling Temperature: normalized feeling temperature in Celsius 
* Humidity: normalized humidity 
* Wind Speed: normalized wind speed 
* Casual Users: count of casual users 
* Registered Users: count of registered users 
* Count: count of total rental bikes, including both casual and registered
