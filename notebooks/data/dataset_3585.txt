The QSAR-TID-11534 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11534. This dataset has one thousand seven hundred three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The QSAR data shows activity values of several compounds on the drug target Cathepsin S, which is a single protein and a cysteine protease. It belongs to the cysteine protease CA clan and the cysteine protease C one A family.

Cathepsin S is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including adaptive immune response, apoptosis, and protein processing. It is also involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the trafficking and processing of endosomal toll-like receptors.

This dataset can be used for further research into the structure-activity relationships of compounds on Cathepsin S and for the development of new inhibitors for this enzyme.

Keywords: QSAR, Cathepsin S, cysteine protease, enzyme, adaptive immune response, apoptosis, protein processing, extracellular matrix, toll-like receptors.
