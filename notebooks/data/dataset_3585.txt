QSAR-TID-11534 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11534. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1703 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features are FCFP6 1024, which are molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is related to Cathepsin S, a protein target that belongs to the Enzyme/Protease/Cysteine protease/Cysteine protease CA clan/Cysteine protease C1A family. Cathepsin S is a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, immune response, and apoptosis.

The dataset provides information on the activity of various compounds on Cathepsin S, which can be useful for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs that target this protein.
