This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one two nine five zero, and it has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which represent the molecular structure of the compounds.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains information about the Metabotropic glutamate receptor seven, which is a single protein preferred name, also known as Gprc one g, Grm seven, Metabotropic glutamate receptor seven, mgLuR seven, and Mglur seven.

The Metabotropic glutamate receptor seven is a protein target classification one, membrane receptor, family C G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, family C GPCR, neurotransmitter receptor, family C GPCR, and Metabotropic glutamate receptor.

It belongs to the species group Rattus norvegicus and has relationships with other proteins, including being a subset of Metabotropic glutamate receptor protein family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including adenylate cyclase inhibiting G protein-coupled glutamate receptor activity, group three metabotropic glutamate receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, voltage-gated calcium channel activity, calcium channel regulator activity, protein binding, calmodulin binding, glutamate receptor activity, adenylate cyclase inhibitor activity, glutamate binding, PDZ domain binding, identical protein binding, protein dimerization activity, calcium-dependent protein binding, serine binding, conditioned taste aversion, behavioral fear response, cell communication, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled glutamate receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled glutamate receptor signaling pathway, chemical synaptic transmission, sensory perception of sound, learning or memory, memory, short-term memory, associative learning, negative regulation of glutamate secretion, transmission of nerve impulse, signaling, adult behavior, multicellular organismal response to stress, negative regulation of neuron apoptotic process, nervous system process, response to stimulus, regulation of synaptic transmission, glutamatergic, axon development, glycosylation, calcium ion transmembrane transport, presynaptic modulation of chemical synaptic transmission.
