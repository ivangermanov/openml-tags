QSAR-TID-30000 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30000. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, demonstrating activity values of various compounds on drug target TID: 30000.
