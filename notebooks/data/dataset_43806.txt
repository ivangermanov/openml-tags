Rainfall in Kerala 1901-2017
Tags: Context

Kerala is a state in South India known for its beautiful beaches and backwaters. It is also known as God's own country and was named one of the paradises of the world by National Geographic. Due to climate change, Kerala has been affected by unprecedented rainfall and floods in recent years. This dataset was obtained from the Indian government's open data initiative to understand the trends.

This raw dataset has the monthly and annual rainfall in millimeters from the year nineteen oh one to two thousand seventeen.

Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the Government of India for opening up this data for further analysis.

Inspiration

Any interesting observations from the past? Can we forecast what the next few years might look like?
