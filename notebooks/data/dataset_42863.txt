The purpose of this dataset is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

This dataset was originally gathered to find a method of distinguishing three-dimensional objects within a two-dimensional image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the two-dimensional silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction. This object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans, and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.

The features were extracted from the silhouettes by a hierarchical image processing system extension, which extracts a combination of scale-independent features utilizing both classical moments-based measures and heuristic measures. Four model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double-decker bus, a Chevrolet van, a Saab, and an Opel Manta. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van, and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation. The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface, and the vehicles were painted matte black to minimize highlights. The images were captured using a framestore connected to a computer. All images were captured with a spatial resolution and were quantized to greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated, and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink modules to remove image noise.

The vehicles were rotated, and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. Two sets of images, each set covering a full three-hundred-sixty-degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively. A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations.
