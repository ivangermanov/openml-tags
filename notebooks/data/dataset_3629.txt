QSAR-TID-100917 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100917. The dataset has 122 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Epithelial Discoidin Domain-Containing Receptor 1, a single protein target that is also known as CAK, CD167 antigen-like family member A, and Cell Adhesion Kinase. This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, cell growth, and protein phosphorylation.

The Epithelial Discoidin Domain-Containing Receptor 1 is a transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell behavior and tissue development. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell-matrix adhesion, and protein phosphorylation, and is also implicated in various diseases, including cancer and fibrosis.
