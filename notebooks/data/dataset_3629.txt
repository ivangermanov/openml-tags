MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-100917
Tags: Machine Learning, Multi Task Learning QSAR, Statistics, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred ninety one seven, and it has one hundred twenty two rows and one thousand twenty six features including IDs and class feature molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings they were obtained using the pipeline pilot program dassault systemes biovia generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and fingerprints.

This dataset was obtained from the metaqsar project in september two thousand fifteen please cite this dataset when using it for any purpose.

The target of this dataset is epithelial discoidin domain containing receptor one which is a single protein preferred name it also has many synonyms including cd one sixty seven antigen like family member a cd antigen equals cd one sixty seven a cell adhesion kinase ddr one.

The organism of this target is homo sapiens and it belongs to the enzyme kinase protein kinase tk protein kinase group tyrosine protein kinase ddr family.

This target has many functions including nucleotide binding protein kinase activity protein tyrosine kinase activity transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity protein binding collagen binding atp binding kinase activity transferase activity metal ion binding and many others.

It is also involved in many biological processes including regulation of cell growth regulation of cell matrix adhesion protein phosphorylation cell adhesion transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway female pregnancy embryo implantation lactation cell population proliferation negative regulation of cell population proliferation regulation of extracellular matrix disassembly positive regulation of neuron projection development and many others.
