Consequently, the rates in the United States Dollar column are always one.

It enables users to analyze trends, patterns, and correlations between different currencies over time. With its extensive coverage of fifty-one currencies, this dataset offers a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners to study the dynamics of international currency markets.
