The Avila dataset has been preprocessed using the Z-normalization method to standardize the life science data. This process involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature, resulting in a distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The dataset has been divided into two subsets, a training set and a testing set, to facilitate model evaluation and validation.

Features included in this dataset are various attributes related to life sciences.

Tags associated with this dataset include Images and Life Science Data.
