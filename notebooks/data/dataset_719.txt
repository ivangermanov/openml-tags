Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: treatment, cell type, status, karnofsky, months, age, therapy, binary class

This dataset, known as Veteran, has been binarized from its original form to create a two-class nominal target feature. The process involved calculating the mean value and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for binary classification tasks and potentially simplifies certain types of analysis. The dataset includes various features related to medical treatment and patient characteristics, which could be valuable for research in healthcare and clinical studies. Users of this dataset should ensure proper citation and be aware of its modified nature compared to the original version.
