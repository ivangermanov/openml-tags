Diabetes Bayesian Network. Sample 0.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are moderate, with a maximum in-degree.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a model-based approach to insulin adjustment, which is a critical aspect of diabetes management.

The network features a range of variables related to meal intake, glucose levels, insulin absorption, and renal clearance, among others. These variables are interconnected to represent the complex relationships between them.

The network is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working on diabetes management and insulin adjustment.
