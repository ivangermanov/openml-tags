**Diabetes Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which provides a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a discrete-very large network consisting of numerous variables related to diabetes management. It has a total of nodes and arcs, with a substantial number of parameters.

One of the key characteristics of this network is its average Markov blanket size, which indicates the complexity of the relationships between variables. Additionally, the average degree of the network highlights the interconnectedness of the variables.

This network was developed using a model-based approach to insulin adjustment, which involves simulating various scenarios to optimize insulin dosing.

Features of the network include meal, cholesterol, insulin absorption, glucose production, and renal clearance, among many others. These variables are crucial in understanding the dynamics of glucose regulation and insulin response.
