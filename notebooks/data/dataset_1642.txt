This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11402. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it provides information about the biological activity of various compounds against a specific drug target. The target is Furin, also known as dibasic-processing enzyme, which is a single protein involved in various biological processes.

Furin is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the processing of precursor proteins into their mature forms. It is localized in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the secretion of proteins outside the cell. Furin has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and influenza.

The dataset includes multiple features that describe the molecular structure of the compounds, including their molecular fingerprints. These features are used to predict the biological activity of the compounds against the Furin target.

Keywords: QSAR, Furin, molecular fingerprints, drug target, biological activity, MetaQSAR project.
