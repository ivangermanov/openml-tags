QSAR-TID-12471 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12471. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The Mu Opioid Receptor is a single protein target, also known as Mor, M-OR-1, MOR-1, Mu-type Opioid Receptor, Oprm. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a G protein-coupled receptor, and belongs to the peptide receptor family. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, GoProcess, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, MICAD, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro.
