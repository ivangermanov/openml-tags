This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mu Opioid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Mu Opioid Receptor. The Mu Opioid Receptor is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Mor, M-OR-1, MOR-1, Mu-type Opioid Receptor, and Oprm. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and opioid receptor.

The Mu Opioid Receptor has multiple functions including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating dopamine receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway. It is involved in multiple biological processes including locomotory behavior, sensory perception of pain, positive regulation of appetite, eating behavior, and response to ethanol.
