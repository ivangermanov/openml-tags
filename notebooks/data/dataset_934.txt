Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version 1). This dataset converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset, known as Socmob, focuses on social mobility and intergenerational occupational changes. It has been transformed from its original numeric format into a binary classification problem, making it suitable for various regression and classification analyses. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive, while those above are labeled as negative. This binarization allows for a more straightforward interpretation of social mobility trends and factors influencing occupational outcomes across generations.

The dataset encompasses several key features that are crucial for understanding social mobility patterns. These include parental occupations, family dynamics, racial backgrounds, and the initial career choices of the younger generation. By examining these factors in conjunction with the binarized outcome, researchers can investigate the complex interplay between socioeconomic background, family structure, and career trajectories.

This resource serves as a valuable tool for sociologists, economists, and data scientists interested in exploring the determinants of social mobility and challenging common assumptions about intergenerational occupational shifts. Its simplified binary structure makes it particularly useful for introductory studies in social science data analysis and machine learning applications focused on societal trends.
