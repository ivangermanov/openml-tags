Philippine Seed Two Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True Tags: Subsampling of the Philippine dataset with a seed of two.

This dataset was generated using the following source code:

The subsample function takes in several parameters including a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify.

First, the function uniformly samples classes from the dataset. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects the specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If there are more columns than the maximum allowed, it selects the specified number of columns randomly.

Then, the function samples rows from the dataset. If there are more rows than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select the specified number of rows based on the class distribution.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to strings and returns the subsampled dataset.
