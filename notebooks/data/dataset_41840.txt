**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex EUR/NOK from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent minute relative to the mean high price of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is expected to increase in the next minute, and false when it is expected to decrease or remain unchanged.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should only be based on predictions made on close attributes (which are also available)**.
