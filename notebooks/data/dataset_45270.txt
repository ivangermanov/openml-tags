Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 7.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete massive network.

The Munin dataset has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex network. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes are moderate, indicating a relatively sparse network. The maximum in-degree of the nodes is relatively low, suggesting that the network does not have highly connected nodes.

The Munin dataset is an expert EMG assistant, designed to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of muscle disorders. The network features a wide range of variables related to muscle function, including muscle activity, muscle strength, and muscle pathology.

The dataset is characterized by a large number of parameters, indicating a high degree of complexity and nuance in the relationships between the variables.

Features of the network include muscle activity measures, muscle strength measures, and muscle pathology measures. The network also includes variables related to muscle denervation, muscle reinnervation, and muscle regeneration.

Keywords: Bayesian network, muscle function, EMG, muscle disorders, diagnosis, treatment.
