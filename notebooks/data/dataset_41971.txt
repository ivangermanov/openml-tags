This collection includes data sets of one dimensional ultrasound raw radio frequency data acquired from the calf muscles of healthy volunteers. The subjects were asked to manually annotate the data to allow for muscle contraction classification tasks. Each line of the file contains a scan consisting of amplitude values, an annotation indicating whether this scan belongs to a contracted muscle or not, the identification of the subject and the identification of the data set.

Features: scan, annotation, subject identification, data set identification

Keywords: ultrasound, muscle contraction, classification, annotation, radio frequency data
