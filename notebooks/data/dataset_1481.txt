Abstract:
This dataset represents a chess endgame scenario, focusing on the positions of the white king, white rook, and black king on the chessboard. The primary objective is to determine the optimal number of turns required for the white player to achieve victory. If the game extends beyond sixteen turns, it is considered a draw. This dataset provides valuable insights into endgame strategies and positional analysis in chess.
