Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Age, Gender, Race, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Chlamydia, is associated with multiple studies as indicated by its tags. The original source and date of creation are unknown. It is important to note that this version is a binarized adaptation of an earlier dataset. The modification process involved transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset includes demographic information such as age, gender, and race, along with the newly created binary classification feature.
