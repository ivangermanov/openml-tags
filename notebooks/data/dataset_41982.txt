Much of machine learning research focuses on producing models that perform well on benchmark tasks, in turn improving our understanding of the challenges associated with those tasks. From the perspective of machine learning researchers, the content of the task itself is largely irrelevant, and thus there have increasingly been calls for benchmark tasks to more heavily focus on problems that are of social or cultural relevance. In this work, we introduce Kuzushiji MNIST, a dataset that focuses on Kuzushiji, or cursive Japanese, as well as two larger, more challenging datasets, Kuzushiji Forty-Nine and Kuzushiji Kanji. Through these datasets, we wish to engage the machine learning community in the world of classical Japanese literature.

Keywords: machine learning, benchmark tasks, social relevance, cultural relevance, Kuzushiji, cursive Japanese, classical Japanese literature.
