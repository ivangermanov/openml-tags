Name: Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete Seed Three

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the dataset Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete. It takes in a seed value, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. The function returns a subsampled dataset.

The subsample function first gets the unique classes from the target variable. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects a random subset of columns. It then subsets the data based on the selected columns.

Finally, the function uniformly samples rows if required. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a random subset of rows. It then subsets the data based on the selected rows.

The function returns a subsampled dataset with the selected features and target variable.
