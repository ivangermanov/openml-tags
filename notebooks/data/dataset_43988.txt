Houses Dataset

This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark. It was transformed in the same way as the dataset used in the tabular data benchmark.

The dataset was collected from all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. A block group, on average, includes a geographically compact area with a population of approximately 1,425.5 individuals. The geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. The distances among the centroids of each block group were computed as measured in latitude and longitude.

The dataset contains 9 variables, with the dependent variable being the natural logarithm of the median house value. The independent variables include median income, median age of housing, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude.

The dataset was preprocessed by excluding all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. The final dataset contains a large number of observations.

The features of the dataset include median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude.
