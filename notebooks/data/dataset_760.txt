Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Year, Train kilometers, Percentage Mark I, Accidents, SPAD preventable, Other preventable, Non preventable, Year grouped, Accidents grouped, SPAD grouped, Other grouped, Non grouped, Train kilometers grouped, Fatalities, SPAD fatalities, Other fatalities, Binary Class

This dataset contains information about train accidents in the United Kingdom, including various metrics related to accident prevention, fatalities, and train operations. The data has been binarized from its original form to create a two-class nominal target feature based on the mean value of the original numeric target. This transformation allows for classification of instances into positive and negative categories, providing a simplified approach to analyzing the accident data. The features encompass a wide range of factors that may contribute to or be affected by train accidents, such as the distance traveled by trains, types of accidents, preventability, and resulting fatalities.
