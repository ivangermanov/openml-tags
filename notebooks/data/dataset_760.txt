This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The conversion process involved transforming the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

The dataset comprises of three distinct features, namely Column One, Column Two, and Binary Class.
