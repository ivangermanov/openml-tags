Cover Type Seed Three Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Cover Type dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of three, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. The stratification argument was set to true.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the dataset were identified, and then a random selection of ten classes was made. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were retained, while the others were discarded. Next, the columns were uniformly sampled, and a random selection of one hundred columns was made.

Finally, the dataset was further reduced by randomly selecting two thousand rows, while ensuring that the class distribution remained stratified.
