This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred one thousand two hundred eighty-one, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes various information about the target protein such as its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description.

The target protein is a single protein known as Serine/threonine-protein kinase DCLK one, also referred to as Doublecortin domain-containing protein three A, Doublecortin-like and CAM kinase-like one. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase DCAMK one family.

The target protein is involved in various biological processes such as neuron migration, protein phosphorylation, nervous system development, axonogenesis, central nervous system development, brain development, response to virus, endosomal transport, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, central nervous system projection neuron axonogenesis, cell differentiation, forebrain development, protein localization to nucleus, intracellular signal transduction, axon extension, neuron projection morphogenesis, dendrite morphogenesis, negative regulation of protein localization to nucleus.

Additionally, the target protein is associated with various cellular components such as plasma membrane and postsynaptic density, and it has molecular functions like nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein serine kinase activity.
