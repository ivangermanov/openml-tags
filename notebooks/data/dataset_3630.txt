QSAR-TID-101281 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101281. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase DCLK one, which is a single protein target. The target is also known as Doublecortin Domain-Containing Protein three A or Doublecortin-Like and CAM Kinase-Like one. It is a protein kinase that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group and DCAMK one family.

The target is involved in various biological processes, including neuron migration, protein phosphorylation, nervous system development, and axonogenesis. It is also involved in the regulation of protein localization to the nucleus and has been implicated in the response to viruses.

The dataset is part of the Expression Atlas, which provides information on gene expression across different tissues and cell types. It is also part of the Gene Ontology, which provides information on the biological processes and molecular functions of genes.
