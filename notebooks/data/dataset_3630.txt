The Tweets of Wisdom 

Twitter has become one of the most popular social media platforms over the past few years, accommodating a diverse range of individuals and thoughts. From celebrities to government policies, Twitter provides a platform for everyone to express themselves. Amidst this diversity, there are numerous Twitter accounts dedicated to sharing self-help thoughts, often related to personal improvement and excelling in various aspects of life. Intrigued by these accounts, I embarked on a journey to explore their tweets, discovering recurring themes throughout.

To delve deeper into these tweets, I utilized the Tweepy Application Programming Interface to scrape data from forty prominent self-help Twitter accounts. The collected data comprises tweets, retweets, and retweets with comments, resulting in a dataset containing more than forty authors. Every retweet from any of the initial forty authors is stored as a tweet from the original author, while retweets with comments include the author's remark, followed by a tag and the content of the retweet.

I extend my gratitude to Stack Overflow, an invaluable resource that assisted me throughout this project, from scraping data to conducting data analysis. Additionally, I appreciate the Tweepy API, which greatly facilitated the process of fetching tweets.

My primary motivations for creating this dataset were to investigate the similarity among these self-help tweets and to identify factors contributing to their virality. I explored these questions further in my kernel, where I analyzed the data to uncover insights into the characteristics of popular self-help tweets.
