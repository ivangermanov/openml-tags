The CHSCase Health dataset has been binarized, converting its numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The resulting dataset consists of several features, including columns one through four, which have been retained in their original form.
