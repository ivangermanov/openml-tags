Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Column One, Column Two, Column Three, Column Four, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on health-related mythbusting and study analysis. It has been processed to create a binary classification system based on the original numeric data. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value and then categorizing instances below this threshold as positive, while those above are labeled as negative. This binarization allows for simplified analysis and comparison of health-related factors.

The dataset includes multiple columns of information, culminating in a binary class designation. This structure enables researchers and analysts to explore relationships between various health indicators and outcomes, potentially uncovering patterns or debunking common misconceptions in the field of health science.

By transforming the original continuous data into a binary format, this dataset facilitates easier interpretation and application of machine learning algorithms, particularly those designed for classification tasks. This approach can be especially useful in health studies where clear distinctions between groups or outcomes are desired.
