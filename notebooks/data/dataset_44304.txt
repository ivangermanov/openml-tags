**Meta Album Textures ALOT Dataset (Mini)**

The Textures ALOT dataset, which consists of images from two hundred and fifty categories, is a comprehensive collection of textures captured in a controlled environment. The images in the dataset showcase different viewing angles, illumination angles, and illumination colors for each material of texture. A preprocessed version of Textures ALOT is used in the Meta Album meta-dataset, where the images are first cropped into square images and then resized to a uniform size with an anti-aliasing filter.

abstract = {For the modeling of materials, the mapping of image features onto a codebook of feature representatives receives extensive treatment. For reason of their generality and simplicity, filterbank outputs are commonly used as features. The MR8 filterbank of Varma and Zisserman is performing well in a recent evaluation. In this paper, we construct color invariant filter sets from the original MR8 filterbank. We evaluate several color invariant alternatives over more than two hundred and fifty real-world materials recorded under a variety of imaging conditions including clutter. Our contribution is a material recognition framework that learns automatically for each material specifically the most discriminative filterbank combination and corresponding degree of color invariance. For a large set of materials each with different physical properties, we demonstrate the material-specific filterbank models to be preferred over models with fixed filterbanks.}
