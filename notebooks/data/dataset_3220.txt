The QSAR-TID-20151 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dipeptidyl Peptidase VIII. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature, namely, MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was generated from the ChEMBL database, specifically from version seventeen. It consists of one thousand four hundred twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features. The features do not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for machine learning modeling. The dataset is suitable for machine learning and statistical analysis.

Dipeptidyl Peptidase VIII is an enzyme that belongs to the serine protease family. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, immune response, and apoptotic process. Inhibitors of this enzyme have potential therapeutic applications.
