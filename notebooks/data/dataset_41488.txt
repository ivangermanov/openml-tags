The Solar Flare dataset is a multivariate regression data set that contains three target variables, which correspond to the number of times three types of solar flare - common, moderate, and severe - are observed within a twenty-four hour period. There are two versions of this dataset, with SF1 containing data from one year and SF2 from another year. This dataset has a range of features, including the Zurich class, the size of the largest spot, the distribution of spots, the level of activity, the evolution of the flare, the activity of the previous day, the complexity of the flare's history, whether the flare became historically complex, the total area, the area of the largest spot, and the classification of the flare into C, M, or X class.
