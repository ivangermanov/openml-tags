This dataset is part of a collection of forty-one drug design datasets, which were formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs used in this dataset were taken from the original study.

The dataset contains one hundred fourteen three features, which are molecular descriptors influencing various properties of solid drugs. These descriptors play a crucial role in classification and prediction of biological activities.

The original study behind this dataset investigated structure-biodegradability relationships for chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. The research aimed to develop quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships for these compounds.
