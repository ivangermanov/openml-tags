QSAR-TID-11140 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11140. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

The generating fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

MOLECULE CHEMEBL ID is one of the features along with many other FCFP features.
