The QSAR-TID-11774 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11774. This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset consists of ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature called Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

This dataset contains information about a specific protein, namely Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidase Two, also known as Membrane-Bound Aminopeptidase P or Membrane-Bound APP. It belongs to the species Rattus Norvegicus.

This protein is classified as an enzyme, specifically a metallo protease belonging to the Metallo Protease MG Clan and Metallo Protease M Twenty-Four B Subfamily.

It has various functions, including aminopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, and metalloaminopeptidase activity. 

This protein is involved in biological processes such as proteolysis and post-translational modification, specifically synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins.
