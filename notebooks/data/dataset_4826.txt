This dataset is about predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope â€“ a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability), may be required to solve the problem.

The dataset was originally obtained from the Marine Resources Division Marine Research Laboratories, Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries, Tasmania. It has been previously used in various studies, including a Ph.D. thesis by Sam Waugh in 1995, where it was used to extend and benchmark Cascade-Correlation. The dataset has also been treated as a three-category classification problem, grouping ring classes one to eight, nine and ten, and eleven onwards.

The dataset contains four thousand one hundred seventy-seven instances, each described by eight attributes: sex, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, and shell weight. There are no missing attribute values. The goal is to predict the number of rings, which corresponds to the age of the abalone.

Statistics for numeric domains include minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients for each attribute. There is no class distribution available.
