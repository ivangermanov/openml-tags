This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The MetaQSAR project was conducted in September 2015. This dataset should be cited accordingly.

The dataset contains multiple compounds with their respective activity values on drug target TID. Each compound has numerous molecular fingerprints which were generated from their corresponding SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The molecular fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The dataset also includes information about the target protein, namely Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Nek11. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group/other protein kinase Nek family/other protein kinase Nek11 classification. 

Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, Guide to Pharmacology, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, and InterPro provide additional information about this protein.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, drug target, protein kinase, Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Nek11.
