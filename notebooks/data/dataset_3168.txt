QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Melatonin receptor C, also known as Melc (alpha) receptor, Mel C R, Melc receptor, Melatonin receptor type C, and mtnrc. This receptor is found in Xenopus laevis and belongs to the membrane receptor/Family A G protein coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family A GPCR)/Monoamine derivative receptor (family A GPCR)/Melatonin receptor classification.

The Melatonin receptor C is associated with several Gene Ontology terms. For cellular components, it is linked to the plasma membrane and membrane. Its molecular functions include G protein coupled receptor activity and melatonin receptor activity. The biological processes it participates in are signal transduction and G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway.

This receptor is referenced in various databases, including canSAR Target, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. The InterPro database provides information on several protein domains associated with this receptor, such as Melatonin receptor, GPCR Rhodopsin, Melatonin receptor C, and GPCR Rhodopsin TM.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains valuable information for researchers studying drug interactions with the Melatonin receptor C. It provides a comprehensive set of molecular fingerprints that can be used to analyze and predict compound activity on this specific target.
