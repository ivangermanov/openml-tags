QSAR-TID-100869 Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: One Hundred Eighty-Nine, and it has eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-seven FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints.
