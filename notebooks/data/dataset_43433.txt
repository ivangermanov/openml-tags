This dataset, Crystal System Properties for Li-ion Batteries, contains data about the physical and chemical properties of Li-ion silicate cathodes. These properties can be useful to predict the class of a Li-ion battery, which can be classified on the basis of their crystal system. There are three major classes of crystal system, including monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic. Feel free to explore the dataset and use any classification algorithm to predict the battery classes.

The dataset features include Material ID, Formula, Space Group, Formation Energy, Energy Above Hull, Band Gap, Number of Sites, Density, Volume, Presence of Band Structure, and Crystal System.
