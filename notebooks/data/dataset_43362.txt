The Netflix Movies dataset contains information about various films available on the platform, which is utilized by the website to provide personalized movie recommendations based on individual user preferences.

This comprehensive dataset is comprised of multiple features, including Movie Name, Duration, Release Year, Genre, Director, Actors, Country of Origin, Rating, and Entry Date on Netflix.

To prepare this dataset for implementation into a recommendation system using machine learning, I employed Netflix's Application Programming Interface (API) to collect the necessary data, followed by extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization procedures.

By leveraging these insights, the goal is to develop an effective recommendation system capable of suggesting movies that align with users' preferred genres.
