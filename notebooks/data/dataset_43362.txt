The Netflix Movies dataset contains information about movies available on Netflix, which is used to provide personalized recommendations based on individual preferences. This dataset is utilized by the Netflix website to suggest movies of a specific genre that a user is likely to enjoy. To create this dataset, I leveraged Netflix's Application Programming Interface (API) to gather data, and then performed exploratory data analysis, cleaning, and visualization to lay the groundwork for a machine learning-based recommendation system.

Features of this dataset include movie name, duration, release year, genre, director, actors, country of origin, rating, and the date it was added to Netflix.

Keywords: Netflix, movies, recommendations, genre, machine learning, API, data analysis.
