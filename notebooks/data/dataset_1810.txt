QSAR-TID-10614 Dataset: Computer Systems, Machine Learning, MTL QSAR Study

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10614. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including molecule IDs and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015.

Description:
The dataset is related to the Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP2 subtype, which is a single protein. It has multiple functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity and prostaglandin E receptor activity. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, such as inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

Expression Atlas provides information on gene expression across different cell types, tissues, and developmental stages. Component analysis reveals that the receptor is localized in the plasma membrane and membrane. Functional analysis shows that it is involved in adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

The receptor also plays a role in response to various stimuli, including nematode, lipopolysaccharide, progesterone, and lipid. Additionally, it regulates cell population proliferation and is involved in cellular response to prostaglandin E stimulus.
