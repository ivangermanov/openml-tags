Win95pts Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a valuable resource for this dataset.

This network consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively large, and the average degree is moderate. The maximum in-degree is also noteworthy.

The features of this network include Print Port, Network Print, Print Data, Data Set Local Clock, Print Driver, Network Speed, Print File, and many others. These features are related to printing and network configurations.

The network also includes features such as Problem Detection, Print Status, Paper Orientation, Print Thread, Application Status, and more. These features are important for understanding the behavior of the printing system.

Additionally, the network includes features related to graphics and fonts, such as Graphics Related Driver Settings, Print Script, and Font Installation. These features are crucial for understanding the printing process.
