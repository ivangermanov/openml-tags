**Quality Prediction in a Mining Process**

**Context**
The dataset originates from a crucial part of a mining process: a flotation plant. The primary objective is to utilize this data to predict the amount of impurity in the ore concentrate. As this impurity is measured every hour, if we can predict the silica content in the ore concentrate, we can provide engineers with early information to take corrective actions and empower them to reduce impurity, if necessary, and also contribute to environmental sustainability by minimizing the amount of ore that goes to tailings.

**Content**
The dataset consists of a time and date range, spanning from March to September. Some columns were sampled every twenty seconds, while others were sampled on an hourly basis. The second and third columns represent quality measures of the iron ore pulp right before it is fed into the flotation plant. Columns four to eight are the most critical variables that impact the ore quality at the end of the process. Columns nine to twenty-two contain process data, including level and air flow inside the flotation columns, which also affect ore quality. The last two columns represent the final iron ore pulp quality measurement from the laboratory. The target is to predict the percentage of silica in the iron ore concentrate.

**Inspiration**
The community's assistance is sought to answer the following questions: Is it possible to predict the percentage of silica concentrate every minute? How many steps ahead can we predict the percentage of silica in concentrate? This would enable engineers to act in a predictive and optimized manner, mitigating the percentage of iron that could have gone to tailings. Is it possible to predict the percentage of silica in concentrate without using the percentage of iron concentrate column, as they are highly correlated?
