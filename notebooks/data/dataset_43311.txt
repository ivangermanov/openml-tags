Quality Prediction in a Mining Process 
Tags: Context 

The dataset originates from one of the most critical components of a mining process: a flotation plant. The primary objective is to utilize this data to forecast the level of impurity present in the ore concentrate. Since this impurity is measured every hour, if we can accurately predict the percentage of silica (impurity) in the ore concentrate, we can empower engineers by providing them with early information to take prompt action. Consequently, they will be able to take corrective measures in advance, thereby reducing the level of impurity, if necessary, and contributing to environmental sustainability by decreasing the amount of ore that ends up in tailings as a result of reduced silica in the ore concentrate.

Content 

The initial column displays a time and date range spanning from March to September. Certain columns were sampled every twenty seconds, while others were sampled on an hourly basis. The second and third columns represent quality measures of the iron ore pulp immediately prior to its introduction into the flotation plant. Columns four through eight encompass the most significant variables influencing the final ore quality. Columns nine through twenty-two comprise process data, including levels and airflow within the flotation columns, which also impact ore quality. The final two columns contain the ultimate iron ore pulp quality measurements obtained from the laboratory. The target is to forecast the final column, representing the percentage of silica in the iron ore concentrate.

Inspiration 

Having worked extensively on this dataset, I am eager to explore whether the community can assist in addressing the following queries: Can we predict the percentage of silica concentrate every minute? How many steps (hours) ahead can we forecast the percentage of silica in concentrate? Answering these questions would enable engineers to operate in a proactive and optimized manner, minimizing the percentage of iron that might otherwise end up in tailings.
