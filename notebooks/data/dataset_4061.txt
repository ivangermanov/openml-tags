QSAR-TID-11287 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11287. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains one hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

This dataset is related to Coagulation Factor XI, a single protein that is a serine-type endopeptidase. It is involved in the blood coagulation process and is a target for the treatment of bleeding disorders.

The dataset includes information on the protein's structure, function, and interactions, as well as its role in various biological processes. It also includes information on the protein's inhibitors and modulators, which are potential drug targets.

The protein is a member of the peptidase S1 family and has a trypsin-like fold. It is activated by thrombin and is involved in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation.

The dataset includes information on the protein's expression, localization, and function, as well as its role in various diseases and disorders.
