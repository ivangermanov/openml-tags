The Superconduct Dataset is categorized under Agriculture and Computer Systems. This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

The dataset contains information on superconductors. It has eighty-one columns containing extracted features and one column containing the critical temperature, which is used as the target variable. The original data from which the features were extracted comes from a public source.

Studies related to this dataset have been published, including an article on Frontiers in Materials.

The dataset was sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI).

Features include mean atomic mass, weighted mean atomic mass, geometric mean atomic mass, weighted geometric mean atomic mass, entropy of atomic mass, weighted entropy of atomic mass, range of atomic mass, weighted range of atomic mass, standard deviation of atomic mass, and weighted standard deviation of atomic mass. Other features include mean first ionization energy, weighted mean first ionization energy, geometric mean first ionization energy, weighted geometric mean first ionization energy, entropy of first ionization energy, weighted entropy of first ionization energy, range of first ionization energy, weighted range of first ionization energy, and standard deviation of first ionization energy. Additionally, there are features for mean atomic radius, density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence.
