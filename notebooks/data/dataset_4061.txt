MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-11287

Tags: Machine Learning, Medicine, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11287. It has one hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID is an identifier for each molecule in the ChEMBL database. MEDIAN_PXC50 is the median of the negative logarithm of the half maximal inhibitory concentration, which is a measure of the potency of a compound.

The dataset is related to Coagulation Factor Eleven, also known as Plasma Thromboplastin Component, which is a serine protease involved in the blood clotting process. It is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma as an inactive zymogen. Upon activation, it cleaves and activates other clotting factors, leading to the formation of a blood clot.

Several compounds have been identified as inhibitors of Coagulation Factor Eleven, including antibodies, enzymes, and small molecules. These inhibitors have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of thrombotic disorders.
