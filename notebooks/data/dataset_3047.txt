QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Cytochrome P family A, also known as alpha hydroxyprogesterone aldolase. This enzyme is involved in steroid biosynthesis, particularly androgen and glucocorticoid production. It is classified as a single protein target and is found in Homo sapiens. The protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and has various functions including monooxygenase activity, steroid alpha monooxygenase activity, and iron ion binding.

Several compounds targeting Cytochrome P family A are mentioned, including abiraterone, orteronel, and seviteronel. These small molecules act as inhibitors of the enzyme and are in various phases of drug development. Abiraterone acetate, for instance, has been approved for clinical use.

The dataset provides information on the protein's involvement in biological processes such as lipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, sex differentiation, and hormone production. It also includes details on associated genetic disorders, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to alpha hydroxylase deficiency.

Various database identifiers and classifications are provided, including Gene Ontology terms for cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. The protein's structure has been determined through multiple PDB entries, and it is referenced in numerous biological databases such as UniProt, InterPro, and Reactome.
