Name: Ailerons

This dataset is a binarized version of the original Ailerons dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). The source and date of the original dataset are unknown.

The dataset contains various features related to aircraft control and performance, including climb rate, pitch, roll, and multiple time-based measurements. Some of the features are differences or derivatives of other measurements. The target variable is a binary classification of aircraft behavior.

This binarized version of the Ailerons dataset is particularly useful for classification tasks and comparative studies in machine learning and data mining. It provides an opportunity to explore the relationship between continuous and discrete target variables in the context of aircraft control systems.

Researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems, especially those related to aerospace engineering and flight dynamics, may find this dataset valuable for their work. The binarization process allows for the application of a wider range of classification algorithms and techniques.
