This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features, including Climb Rate, SGz, Pitch, Roll, Absolute Roll, Difference in Climb, Difference in Roll Rate, Difference in Difference in Climb, and several time-based features. Additionally, there are features related to differences in time, Alpha, and Se.

Binary Class is the target feature, which has been binarized for regression analysis. This dataset is suitable for studying various aspects of chemistry and life science, as well as exploring myth-busting concepts.
