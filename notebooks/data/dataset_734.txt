Visualizing Hamster Dataset: A Binarized Version for Myth-Busting and Study Purposes 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset, specifically designed for myth-busting and study purposes. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature, where all instances with a lower target value are classified as positive ('Positive') and all others are classified as negative ('Negative'). 

The dataset includes various features related to organ sizes, including Lung, Heart, Liver, Spleen, and Kidney sizes. These features have been carefully selected to facilitate comprehensive analysis and study.
