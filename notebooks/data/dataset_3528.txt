QSAR-TID-12938 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12938. The dataset has eighty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12938. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has eighty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Carboxypeptidase A1 enzyme, which is a single protein preferred name. The enzyme is also known by other names, including Carboxypeptidase A1 CPA and CPA1. It belongs to the species Bos taurus and is classified as a metallo protease M fourteen A subfamily.

The enzyme has various functions, including carboxypeptidase activity, metallocarboxypeptidase activity, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and leukotriene metabolic process.
