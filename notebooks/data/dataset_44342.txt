**Meta Album Subcellular Human Protein Dataset (Extended)**

This dataset is a subset of the Subcellular dataset in the Protein Atlas project. The original dataset stems from the Human Protein Atlas Image Classification competition and comprises images of human protein patterns in cells, each belonging to one or more out of twenty-eight classes. The labels correspond to protein organelle localizations.

For Meta Album, we performed two modifications: we turned the dataset into a multi-class dataset by dropping all images belonging to more than a single class and also those images that belong to classes with less than forty members; we converted the remaining images into RGB by dropping the yellow channel, a common practice in the competition. Finally, we resized the images from the original dataset to a uniform size.
