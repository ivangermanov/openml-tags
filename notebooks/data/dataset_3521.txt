QSAR-TID-10226 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase 26, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP6 features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. Matrix Metalloproteinase 26 is a single protein target that belongs to the Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAM clan/Metallo protease M10A subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, and negative regulation of inflammatory response.

Matrix Metalloproteinase 26 is also known as Endometase, Matrilysin-2, and MMP-26. It is a metalloendopeptidase that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins. The protein is localized in the extracellular region, extracellular space, and extracellular matrix.
