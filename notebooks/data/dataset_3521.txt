The QSAR-TID-10226 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Twenty-Six. This dataset has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent extended-connectivity fingerprints, also known as molecular fingerprints, which were generated from simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule identifiers and extended-connectivity fingerprints.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Twenty-Six is a single protein, also known as Endometase, Matrilysin-Two, or Matrix Metalloproteinase Twenty-Six. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, specifically a protease and a metalloprotease, belonging to the metalloprotease M ten A subfamily.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, and negative regulation of inflammatory response. It is located in the extracellular region, extracellular space, and extracellular matrix.
