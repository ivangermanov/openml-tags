Diabetes Dataset
----------------

The Diabetes dataset contains ten baseline variables, including age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, obtained for each of the diabetes patients. Additionally, the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, is also included.

Data Set Characteristics:

The dataset consists of a total of instances, with each instance having a total of attributes. The first ten columns are numeric predictive values, and the eleventh column is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Attribute Information:

The dataset includes the following attributes: age in years, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol divided by high-density lipoproteins, possibly log of serum triglycerides level, and blood sugar level. Each of these ten feature variables has been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the square root of the number of samples.
