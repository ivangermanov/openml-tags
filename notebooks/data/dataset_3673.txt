Employee Turnover at TechCo

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Context:
These simulated data are based on employee turnover data in a real technology company in India, referred to by the pseudonym TechCo. The data can be used to analyze the drivers of turnover at TechCo.

The original dataset was analyzed in a research paper, which demonstrated how machine learning can be useful for discovering nonlinear and interactive patterns between variables that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. This publicly offered dataset is simulated based on the original data for privacy considerations. Along with the accompanying Python and R codes, this dataset will help readers learn how to implement machine learning techniques to discover these patterns.

Content:
This dataset includes entry-level employees who were randomly assigned to any of TechCo's geographically dispersed production centers. The data are structured as a panel with one observation for each month that an individual is employed at the company. The dataset includes observations from employees over a certain period of time.

Objectives:
The primary objective is to explore patterns in the data that would help us learn more about the factors influencing employee turnover. Another objective is to develop the most accurate predictive model to estimate when a specific employee will leave the company.

Features:
The dataset includes various attributes related to the employees, including their performance scores, demographic information, and work environment characteristics.
