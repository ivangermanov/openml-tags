QSAR-TID-50 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 50. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The dataset is composed of several compounds, each with its corresponding activity value on drug target TID: 50. The activity values are represented in pseudo-pCI50 units. The dataset also includes features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, which represents the unique identifier for each compound in the ChEMBL database.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in QSAR modeling and virtual screening. The dataset can be used to develop and train QSAR models, which can be used to predict the activity of new compounds on drug target TID: 50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.
