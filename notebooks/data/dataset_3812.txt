QSAR-TID-50 Dataset Description:

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Fifty, and it consists of One Thousand Four Hundred Fourteen rows and One Thousand Twenty-Six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP Six One Zero Two Four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Demographic information includes organism species, Homo sapiens, and protein target classification as one, membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, monoamine receptor, and adrenergic receptor.

The preferred name for this protein target is Beta-One Adrenergic Receptor, also known as ADRB One, ADRB One R, B One AR, Beta-One Adrenergic Receptor, and Beta-One Adrenoceptor.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, released in September Two Thousand Fifteen.
