The Meta-Album Boats Dataset Extended 

The original version of the Meta-Album Boats dataset is called the Marvel dataset. It contains over one hundred thirty-eight thousand images of twenty-six different maritime vessels in their natural backgrounds. Each class has a varying number of images ranging from one thousand eight hundred two to eight thousand nine hundred thirty, all of which have variable resolutions. To preprocess this dataset, we duplicated the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and rightmost three columns based on the orientation of the original image to create square images. We did not apply any cropping because the boats occupy most of the image, and doing so would result in incomplete images. Finally, the square images were resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
