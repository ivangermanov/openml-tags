QSAR-TID-10407 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin II, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin II. Trypsin II is a single protein, also known as Anionic Trypsin, and it belongs to the species Bos taurus. It is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, and serine protease PA clan, and serine protease S1A subfamily.

The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP features. The FCFP features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Trypsin II is involved in multiple biological processes, including proteolysis, digestion, and collagen catabolic process. It has multiple functions, including serine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.
