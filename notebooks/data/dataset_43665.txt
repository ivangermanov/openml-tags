Indian Liver Patient Records
Tags: Context

Patients suffering from liver disease have been continuously increasing due to excessive consumption of alcohol, inhalation of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles, and drugs. This dataset was utilized to assess prediction algorithms in an endeavor to alleviate the burden on medical professionals.

The dataset comprises four hundred sixteen liver patient records and one hundred sixty-seven non-liver patient records collected from the North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "dataset" column serves as a class label employed to categorize individuals into two distinct groups: those afflicted with liver disease and those without any liver-related affliction. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset encompasses four hundred forty-one male patient records and one hundred forty-two female patient records. It is noteworthy that any individual whose age exceeds eighty-nine is listed as being ninety years old.

The columns within this dataset include the patient's age, gender, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total proteins, albumin, albumin and globulin ratio, and a dataset column employed for categorization purposes.

The primary objective of utilizing these patient records is to accurately determine which individuals are afflicted with liver disease and which ones are not.
