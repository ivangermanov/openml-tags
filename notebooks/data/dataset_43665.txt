Indian Liver Patient Records
Tags: Context

Patients with liver disease have been continuously increasing due to excessive consumption of alcohol, inhalation of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles, and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce the burden on doctors.
