QSAR-TID-11558 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Alpha. Retinoid X Receptor Alpha is a single protein, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member One, Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-Alpha, and Rxra. It is a transcription factor and a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes.

The dataset has multiple features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features are FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Retinoid X Receptor Alpha is a protein target that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including transcription regulation, cell differentiation, and embryonic development. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of retinoic acid signaling.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
