Radar Traffic Data

Tags: Context Traffic Data

This dataset contains traffic data collected from several Wavetronix radar sensors deployed by the City of Austin. The dataset is augmented with geo coordinates from a sensor location dataset.

The data was acquired from the City of Austin's open data portal, and it represents a specific time period. Understanding the context of the data is crucial to making the most out of it. Therefore, it is essential to know how the data was acquired and what time period it represents.

The data source is the City of Austin's open data portal.

This dataset will be in front of the world's largest data science community, and it has the potential to answer many questions. Some of the questions that can be explored using this dataset include traffic patterns, volume, and direction.

The dataset contains the following features: location name, location latitude, location longitude, year, month, day, day of the week, hour, minute, time bin, direction, and volume.
