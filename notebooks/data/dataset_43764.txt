Country Profiles

We have built comprehensive country profiles that enable users to delve into the statistics surrounding the coronavirus pandemic for every country worldwide. In the midst of a rapidly evolving pandemic, identifying the countries that are making significant progress against it is no straightforward task. Our primary focus lies in excess mortality and the rate of confirmed deaths, but for a more comprehensive assessment, a broader perspective is essential.

To achieve this, we track the pandemic's impact throughout our publication and have created in-depth country profiles for every nation globally. Each profile encompasses interactive visualizations, detailed explanations of the presented metrics, and information on the sources of the data. Moreover, every country profile is updated on a daily basis.

The country profiles include an array of relevant metrics, such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total cases per million, new cases per million, and many others. These metrics provide valuable insights into the progression of the pandemic within each country.

Additionally, the profiles include demographic and economic indicators, including population, population density, median age, GDP per capita, extreme poverty, and human development index. These indicators offer context to the pandemic's impact on various societies.

Some key aspects of the pandemic, such as vaccination rates, testing figures, and government responses, are also captured within the profiles. The inclusion of these metrics enables a more nuanced understanding of how different countries are responding to the crisis.
