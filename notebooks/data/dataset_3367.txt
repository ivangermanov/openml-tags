The QSAR-TID-12132 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12132. This dataset has forty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. These molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR models and datasets for machine learning applications. 

The target protein is Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta-One, also known as c-erbA-two, c-erbA-Beta, Erba-two, Nr-one-A-two, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group A Member Two. 

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, thyroid hormone-mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of thyroid hormone-mediated signaling pathway, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, sensory perception of sound, negative regulation of female receptivity, regulation of heart contraction, female courtship behavior, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, animal organ morphogenesis, regulation of lipid metabolic process, cell differentiation, positive regulation of chondrocyte differentiation, mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase two, positive regulation of ossification, negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, retinal cone cell development, retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway, embryonic organ development, type one pneumocyte differentiation, regulation of cholesterol metabolic process, regulation of triglyceride metabolic process, cellular response to thyroid hormone stimulus, retinal cone cell apoptotic process.
