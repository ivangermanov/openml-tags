This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha is also known as one seventy kilodalton melanoma membrane-bound gelatinase, antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme, FAP, soluble form, APCE, dipeptidyl peptidase FAP, FAP - All.

It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens.

Its protein target classification is one point enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease SC clan/serine protease S nine B subfamily.

It is involved in various biological processes including angiogenesis, proteolysis, apoptotic process, cell adhesion, regulation of collagen catabolic process, negative regulation of extracellular matrix disassembly, endothelial cell migration, proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process, regulation of cell cycle, regulation of fibrinolysis, negative regulation of cell proliferation involved in contact inhibition, melanocyte proliferation, positive regulation of execution phase of apoptosis, melanocyte apoptotic process, and negative regulation of extracellular matrix organization.
