Title: Recurrent Event (Defect Fix) and Size Data for Mozilla Classes

Tags: mythbusting, OpenML, PROMISE, study, time series

This dataset includes a binary attribute (event) to show defect fixes. The data is at the "observation" level. Each modification made to a C++ class was entered as an observation. A newly added class created an observation. The observation period was between May and February.

The dataset was used for modeling the effect of size on defect proneness for open source software. Quality is becoming increasingly important with the continuous adoption of open source software. Previous research has found that there is generally a positive relationship between module size and defect proneness. Therefore, in open source software development, it is important to monitor module size and understand its impact on defect proneness.

Traditional approaches to quality modeling, which measure specific system snapshots and obtain future defect counts, are not well suited because open source modules usually evolve and their size changes over time. In this study, Cox proportional hazards modeling with recurrent events was used to study the effect of class size on defect proneness in the Mozilla product. The effect of size was found to be significant, and this effect on defect proneness was quantified.

The dataset includes features such as a numeric identification assigned to each separate C++ class, start and end times for modifications, a binary event indicator for defect fixes, class size measured in source lines of code, and a state indicator for whether a class has experienced an event.
