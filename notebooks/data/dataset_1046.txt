Title: Recurrent Event Defect Fix and Size Data for Mozilla Classes

This data set includes a binary attribute to show defect fix and is at the observation level. Each modification made to a C++ class was entered as an observation. A newly added class created an observation. The observation period was between May twenty-ninth, two thousand two, and February twenty-second, two thousand six.

Past Usage:
This data set was used for studying the effect of size on defect proneness for open-source software. Previous research has found that there is generally a positive relationship between module size and defect proneness. Therefore, in open-source software development, it is important to monitor module size and understand its impact on defect proneness. However, traditional approaches to quality modeling, which measure specific system snapshots and obtain future defect counts, are not well-suited because open-source modules usually evolve and their size changes over time.

Features:
This data set is used to create a conditional Cox Proportional Hazards Model. It includes the following attributes: identification assigned to each separate C++ class, a time infinitesimally greater than the time of the modification that created this observation, either the time of the next modification, or the end of the observation period, or the time of deletion, whichever comes first, a binary attribute to show defect fix, the number of source lines of code of the C++ classes at the time of the modification, and a state attribute initially set to zero and becomes one after the class experiences an event.
