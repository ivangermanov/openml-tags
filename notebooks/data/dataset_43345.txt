Machine Learning and Statistics Context 

This is the preprocessed train data from the Quora Insincere Questions Competition. 

The original train data has undergone preprocessing to remove stop words, numbers, punctuation marks, and common words, and has been converted to lowercase. 

Subsequently, the resultant dataset has been lemmatized and stemmed using the scikit-learn/NLTK library.

This dataset contains a large collection of quora questions, with approximately one point three million rows of data, where target equals zero indicates sincere questions and target equals one indicates insincere questions.

Acknowledgments
