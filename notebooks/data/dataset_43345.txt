The Quora Insincere Questions dataset, tagged as Context, is a preprocessed train data from the Quora Insincere Questions competition in the year two thousand and eighteen. The original train data underwent significant transformations to remove stop words, numbers, punctuations, and common words, and was converted to lower case. Furthermore, the resultant dataset was lemmatized and stemmed using the scikit-learn/NLTK library.

This dataset contains a substantial amount of quora questions, approximately one point three million rows, with a target variable assigned to each question. The target variable is assigned a value of zero for sincere questions and a value of one for insincere questions.

The dataset is a valuable resource and the author would like to extend gratitude to the Co-learning lounge mentors for their guidance and support in working on this problem. The dataset is particularly useful for building machine learning models in natural language processing.

The dataset features include the question identifier, the question text, and the target variable.
