The Weather Test dataset is a tiny collection of data that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game. In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. In this case, there are four attributes that describe the weather conditions: the outlook, which could be sunny or cloudy, the temperature, which could be hot or cold, the humidity, which could be high or low, and whether it is windy or not. The outcome or target variable is whether to play the game or not, based on these weather conditions.
