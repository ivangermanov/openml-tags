Compass Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

This is a subsampling of the dataset Compass with a seed of zero, where the maximum number of rows is two thousand, the maximum number of columns is one hundred, and the maximum number of classes is ten. The stratification is set to true.

The subsample function takes in several parameters, including the seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first uniformly samples the classes, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples the columns, selecting a specified number of columns at random. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it stratifies the data and selects a subset of rows.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to strings and returns the resulting dataset, including the dataset name, features, and categorical mask.

Features include sex, age, race, juvenile felony count, juvenile misdemeanor count, juvenile other count, prior count, days between screening and arrest, days from compass, charge degree, decile score, score text, type of assessment, and recidivism status.
