The Atlas Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014 dataset is a collection of data from the CERN website, which also hosts the documentation of the data. This dataset was used in the Kaggle Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014, and further information about the challenge can be found on the Kaggle website, the challenge website, and the PMLR competition proceedings.

Notes:

* This version of the dataset encodes -999 as Not a Number (NaN).
* This version only contains the data used by the Kaggle competition.

The dataset features include Event Identification, Mass Measurements, Particle Transverse Momentum, Particle Visible Mass, Particle Total Transverse Momentum, and other particle physics-related properties. Additionally, the dataset includes Weight and Label information, as well as a Kaggle Set and Kaggle Weight.
