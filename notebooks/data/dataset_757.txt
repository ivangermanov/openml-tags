Binarized Regression Problem Dataset

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features such as Dataset Name, Temperature, Number of atoms, pressure, reaction rate constant, Binary indicator, Cost, Standard Deviation ratio, correlation, canonical correlation coefficients, fractal dimensions, skewness, kurtosis, Hydrogen bond count, Hydrogen bond energy, Molecular complexity, Atomization energy, and Algorithm Name.

The resulting binary class labels are either Positive or Negative.
