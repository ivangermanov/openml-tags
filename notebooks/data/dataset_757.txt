Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, focusing on mythbusting and various studies. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification, where instances below the mean are labeled as positive and those above as negative. This conversion allows for a simplified analysis of the data, potentially revealing insights that might not be apparent in the continuous regression format.

The dataset includes various features related to statistical properties, correlations, and algorithmic performance. These features provide a comprehensive view of the data's characteristics and the effectiveness of different analytical approaches. The binarization process enables researchers to apply classification algorithms and techniques to what was originally a regression problem, potentially uncovering new patterns or relationships within the data.
