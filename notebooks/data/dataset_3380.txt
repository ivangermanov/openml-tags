QSAR-TID-101598 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101598. The dataset has 399 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and includes activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings, which are a notation for describing molecular structures. The fingerprints are used to capture the structural properties of molecules, which can be used to predict their activity.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a large collection of QSAR data for a specific drug target. The data can be used to develop predictive models of molecular activity, which can aid in the identification of potential drug candidates.
