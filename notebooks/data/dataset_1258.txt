The QSAR-TID-12514 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12514, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.

The QSAR data shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one two five one four. The features of this dataset represent fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains multiple features, including molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

This dataset is related to the alpha one a adrenergic receptor, which is a single protein. Its preferred name is alpha one a adrenergic receptor, and its synonyms include adra one a, adra one c, alpha one a adrenergic receptor, alpha one a adrenoceptor, and alpha one a adrenoreceptor.

The alpha one a adrenergic receptor is classified under membrane receptor family a g protein coupled receptor small molecule receptor family a gpcr monoamine receptor adrenergic receptor. It is an integral component of the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including mapk cascade, negative regulation of heart rate involved in baroreceptor response to increased systemic arterial blood pressure, norepinephrine epinephrine vasoconstriction involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, and positive regulation of heart rate by epinephrine norepinephrine.
