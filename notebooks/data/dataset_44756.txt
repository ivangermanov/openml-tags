Subsampling of the dataset Riccardo with a specified set of parameters. This dataset has undergone a process of subsampling, which involves reducing its size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the number of classes was limited to a maximum of ten. To achieve this, a uniform sampling method was used to select the desired number of classes from the total number of unique classes present in the dataset. The selection was based on the frequency of each class, ensuring that the sampled classes were representative of the overall distribution.

Next, the number of columns was limited to a maximum of one hundred. Again, a uniform sampling method was used to select the desired number of columns from the total number of columns present in the dataset.

Finally, the number of rows was limited to a maximum of two thousand. To ensure that the sampled rows were representative of the overall distribution, a stratified sampling method was used. This involved splitting the dataset into subsets based on the class labels and then sampling a specified number of rows from each subset.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, with the categorical mask and column names preserved. The dataset is a subsampled version of the Riccardo dataset, with a reduced number of classes, columns, and rows.
