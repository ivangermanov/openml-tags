This database, tagged as Heart Disease Classification, contains a vast array of attributes, but all published experiments refer to utilizing a subset of the most relevant ones. The primary goal of this dataset is to determine the presence of heart disease in a patient, which is denoted by an integer value of either zero or one. The features that are utilized to achieve this goal include the patient's age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar level, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, old peak, slope of the peak exercise, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia diagnosis.
