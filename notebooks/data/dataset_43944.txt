This database contains a large number of attributes, however, all published experiments have focused on utilizing a subset of fourteen of these attributes. The primary objective of this classification task is to determine the presence of heart disease in patients, which is represented by the goal field. This field has an integer value of either zero or one.

The subset of fourteen attributes includes characteristics such as the patient's age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar level, electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved during exercise, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and the thallium stress test outcome.
