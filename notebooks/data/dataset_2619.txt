The Weather Problem dataset is a small collection of data that we will utilize repeatedly to demonstrate various machine learning techniques. This entirely fictional dataset supposedly revolves around the conditions deemed suitable for engaging in an unspecified outdoor game. Generally, instances within a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes, which serve to measure distinct aspects of each instance. 

In this particular scenario, there exist four primary attributes: overall atmospheric conditions, ambient air temperature, relative humidity, and presence of wind. The ultimate outcome of interest is determining whether or not to engage in the aforementioned outdoor activity.
