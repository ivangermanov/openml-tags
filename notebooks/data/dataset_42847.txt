Glass Dataset Information

A comparison test was conducted to evaluate the performance of a rule-based system, the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis in determining whether a type of glass is float processed or not. The results of this test are presented below.

In the context of criminological investigations, the correct identification of glass types found at a crime scene can serve as crucial evidence. This study aimed to develop a classification system for different types of glass.

The dataset consists of two hundred fourteen samples, each characterized by nine attributes: refractive index, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, barium, and iron. The class attribute, type of glass, has seven categories: building windows float processed, building windows non-float processed, vehicle windows float processed, vehicle windows non-float processed, containers, tableware, and headlamps.

The comparison test yielded the following results: for windows that were float processed, the rule-based system, nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis produced ten, twelve, and twenty-one incorrect answers, respectively. For windows that were not float processed, the corresponding numbers of incorrect answers were nineteen, sixteen, and twenty-two.
