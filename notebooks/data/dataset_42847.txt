Glass Dataset Information

Additional Information 

A comparison test was conducted to evaluate the performance of a rule-based system, BEAGLE, the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis in determining whether a type of glass was float processed or not. 

In the context of criminological investigations, the correct identification of glass found at a crime scene can serve as crucial evidence. 

The dataset contains two hundred fourteen samples, each characterized by nine attributes: Refractive Index, Sodium, Magnesium, Aluminum, Silicon, Potassium, Calcium, Barium, and Iron. These attributes correspond to the chemical composition of the glass samples, with measurements expressed in terms of weight percentage in their respective oxides.

The class attribute, Type of Glass, categorizes the samples into seven classes: Building Windows Float Processed, Building Windows Non-Float Processed, Vehicle Windows Float Processed, Vehicle Windows Non-Float Processed, Containers, Tableware, and Headlamps.

In the comparative study, the following results were obtained:

For windows that were float processed, ten incorrect answers were obtained using BEAGLE, twelve using the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and twenty-one using discriminant analysis. For windows that were not float processed, nineteen incorrect answers were obtained using BEAGLE, sixteen using the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and twenty-two using discriminant analysis.
