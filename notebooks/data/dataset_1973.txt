QSAR-TID-11626 Dataset 

Tags: Demographics, Education, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11626. The data consists of five hundred seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset provides information about the target protein, cyclin-dependent kinase nine, which is a single protein and its preferred name is cyclin-dependent kinase nine. It also has synonyms such as C-two K, CDC two L four, CDK nine, cell division cycle two-like protein kinase four, and cell division protein kinase nine.

Cyclin-dependent kinase nine is an enzyme that belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase CDK family. It is involved in various biological processes, including transcription by RNA polymerase two, transcription initiation at RNA polymerase two promoter, transcription elongation by RNA polymerase two, protein phosphorylation, and DNA repair.

This protein is localized in the nucleus and nucleoplasm and is involved in protein-protein interactions. It binds to various molecules, including ATP, DNA, and proteins, and is regulated by phosphorylation.

Several small molecules have been identified as inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase nine, including RGB-two eight six six thirty-eight, BMS-three eight seven zero three two, DINACICLIB, SELICICLIB, and RIVICICLIB. These molecules have been shown to inhibit the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase nine and have potential therapeutic applications.
