Title: AR1 Software Defect Prediction
Date: February 4, 2009

The data originates from a Turkish white goods manufacturer and was donated by the Software Research Laboratory (Softlab) at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey. The dataset pertains to embedded software in a white goods product, implemented in the C programming language. It comprises 121 modules, of which 9 are defective and 112 are defect free.

The dataset includes 29 static code attributes, encompassing McCabe, Halstead, and Lines of Code (LOC) measures, along with defect information (false/true). Function and method level static code attributes were collected using the Prest Metrics Extraction and Analysis Tool, which is available on the Softlab website.

Features include various lines of code metrics (total, blank, comment, code and comment, executable), unique and total operands and operators, Halstead metrics (vocabulary, length, volume, level, difficulty, effort, error, time), branch and decision counts, call pairs, condition counts, cyclomatic complexity and related metrics, design complexity and density, and formal parameters.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of software engineering, particularly those focused on defect prediction and code quality analysis in embedded systems.
