**AR1 - Software Defect Prediction**

The dataset was donated by the Software Research Laboratory (Softlab) at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey. The data originates from a Turkish white-goods manufacturer and represents embedded software in a white-goods product implemented in C programming language. It consists of one hundred twenty-one modules, nine of which are defective and one hundred twelve are defect-free.

Twenty-nine static code attributes were collected using the Prest Metrics Extraction and Analysis Tool. These attributes include McCabe, Halstead, and Lines of Code measures. Additionally, the dataset contains one defect information attribute indicating whether each module is defective or not.

Function-method-level static code attributes were gathered using the Prest Metrics Extraction and Analysis Tool, which is available online. The dataset provides valuable insights into software defect prediction and can be used for research purposes.

Features: total lines of code, blank lines of code, comment lines of code, code and comment lines of code, executable lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and design complexity.

Keywords: software defect prediction, PROMISE repository, embedded software, static code attributes, McCabe measure, Halstead measure, Lines of Code measure.
