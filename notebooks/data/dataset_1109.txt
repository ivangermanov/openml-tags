This dataset, known as Lymphoma Classes, is associated with multiple studies focusing on genetic analysis of lymphoma. The dataset contains an extensive list of gene features, indicating a comprehensive genetic profiling approach. The exact number of features is not specified, but it appears to be a high-dimensional dataset with thousands of genetic markers. The source and date of the dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper citation when using this data for research purposes. The genetic information provided could be valuable for understanding the molecular basis of different lymphoma types and potentially for developing targeted therapies or diagnostic tools.
