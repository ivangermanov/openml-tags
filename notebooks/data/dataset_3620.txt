QSAR-TID-102840 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102840. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The target is a single protein, Protein-tyrosine kinase 2-beta, also known as Calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase, Calcium-regulated non-receptor proline-rich tyrosine kinase, and other synonyms. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and tyrosine protein kinase Fak family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, response to reactive oxygen species, angiogenesis, oocyte maturation, response to hypoxia, and many others. It is also involved in various cellular components, including nucleus, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and others.

The protein has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, and others. It is also involved in various protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways.
