QSAR-TID-102840 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102840. 

The dataset has eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. 

They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.

The dataset was scraped from various sources.
