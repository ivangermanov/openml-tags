This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-12261, falls under the categories of Computational Universe, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR. It was derived from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values measured in pseudo-pCI50 units for various compounds on the drug target identified as TID: 12261. The dataset comprises one thousand eight hundred forty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Notably, generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset includes a molecule CHEMBL ID and a median pXC50 class feature. The remaining features consist of FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
