QSAR-TID-12261 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12261. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing the structure of a molecule as a binary string. This allows for the comparison and analysis of different molecules and their properties. The fingerprints were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, which is a software tool for cheminformatics and bioinformatics.

The dataset is a valuable resource for anyone working with QSAR data, and it provides a comprehensive collection of activity values for compounds on a specific drug target.
