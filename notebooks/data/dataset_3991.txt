QSAR-TID-194 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Coagulation Factor X, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Coagulation Factor X. Coagulation Factor X is a single protein that is also known as Activated Factor Xa Heavy Chain, Coagulation Factor X, Factor X Heavy Chain, and Factor X Light Chain. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protease family and is involved in the blood coagulation pathway.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen. It contains multiple features, including MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50, which are human-readable. However, the rest of the features are FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are not human-readable.

Coagulation Factor X is a protein that is involved in the blood coagulation pathway. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protease family and is responsible for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. It is also involved in the regulation of blood clotting and is a target for anticoagulant therapy.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and machine learning applications. It is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists who are working on the development of new anticoagulant drugs.
