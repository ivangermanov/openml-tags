Dataset Name: jEdit

Tags: mythbusting, study

Features: Weighted Methods per Class, Depth of Inheritance Tree, Number of Children, Coupling Between Object classes, Response For a Class, Lack of Cohesion in Methods, Number of Public Methods, Lines of Code, Bug count

This dataset pertains to the jEdit text editor, focusing on various software metrics and bug counts across different versions. It includes several study-related tags, indicating its use in multiple research efforts. The features listed encompass a range of object-oriented design metrics commonly used in software quality assessment and defect prediction studies. These metrics provide insights into the structural complexity, inheritance characteristics, coupling, cohesion, and size of the software components. The inclusion of a bug count feature suggests that this dataset may be particularly useful for investigating correlations between these software metrics and the occurrence of defects in the jEdit codebase.
