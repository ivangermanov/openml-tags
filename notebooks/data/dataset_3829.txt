QSAR-TID-12566 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12566. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features of the dataset are primarily FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in cheminformatics. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3, which is a single protein target. This receptor is a type of G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and synaptic transmission.

The receptor is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and basolateral plasma membrane, and is involved in the regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle contraction, heart rate, and insulin secretion.
