This directory contains six databases, corresponding test sets, and documentation related to thyroid disease. The databases were originally created by the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia. 

The documentation files provide information about the databases, including the source of the data, the number and names of attributes, and the types of values each attribute can take. 

In general, these databases share certain characteristics. They have many attributes, mostly numeric or boolean valued, and relate to thyroid disease domains. There are some missing attribute values, signified by a question mark. The number of classes varies across the databases. 

Each database has a large number of instances, with a separate test set containing a smaller number of instances. It appears that the test sets do not overlap with the corresponding data sets, although this has not been verified.

There are two additional databases, hypothyroid and sick euthyroid, which have similar formats but uncertain integrity due to potential corruption. They have different numbers of instances and do not have corresponding test files. 

Another recent addition is a database containing the latest archive of thyroid diagnoses, consisting of a large number of records. A domain theory related to thyroid disease has also been included. Finally, there is an additional thyroid database with different characteristics.

Features include various variables related to thyroid disease.

Scraped data includes dataset information and additional details.

Dataset information includes details about the datasets, including their sources and characteristics.

Additional information notes that the datasets come from the Garavan Institute, with documentation provided. There are six main databases, plus two additional ones with uncertain integrity, and another larger database. Finally, there is one more thyroid database with different characteristics.
