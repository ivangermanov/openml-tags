QSAR-TID-12029 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12029. The dataset has twenty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12029. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has twenty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the expression of the Acrosin protein, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as Acrosin heavy chain and Acrosin light chain, and it belongs to the Serine protease PA clan and Serine protease S1A subfamily. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, acrosome reaction, and fertilization.

The dataset provides information on the protein's expression in different tissues and cells, including the acrosomal vesicle, extracellular region, nucleus, and Golgi-associated vesicle. The protein is also involved in various molecular functions, including protease binding, DNA binding, and peptidase activity.
