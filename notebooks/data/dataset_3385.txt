This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one twenty-nine, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and numerous other molecular fingerprints.

Scraped data includes information about the protein target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification.

The protein target is a single protein known as Acrosin, also referred to as ACR, Acrosin Heavy Chain, and Acrosin Light Chain. It belongs to the species group of humans and is classified as an enzyme, specifically a serine protease.

Additional information includes expression atlas, gene ontology components, functions, and processes, as well as interactions and reactions involving this protein target.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, protein target, Acrosin, serine protease.
