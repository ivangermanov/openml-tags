QSAR-TID-11752 Dataset Information:

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11752. It has numerous rows and features, including identifiers and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Dataset Details:

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

Compound Information:

The compounds in this dataset have activity values represented in terms of pseudo-pCI50. These values indicate the potency of each compound against the target protein.

Molecular Fingerprints:

The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints were generated using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Target Protein Information:

The target protein for this dataset is Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor three, also known as FLT four. It belongs to the single protein type and is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase. This protein plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, lymph vessel development, and vasculature development.
