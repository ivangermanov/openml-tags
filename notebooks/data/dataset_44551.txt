Name: Ozone Level Eight Hour Seed Three 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Ozone Level Eight Hour 

This dataset has been created through subsampling of the original Ozone Level Eight Hour dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows. 

The subsampling algorithm used a seed value of three to ensure reproducibility. It also limited the maximum number of rows to two thousand, maximum number of columns to one hundred, and maximum number of classes to ten. Additionally, the algorithm employed stratified sampling to maintain the class balance in the resulting dataset.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, which have been randomly selected to meet the specified column limit. The class labels have also been preserved and balanced through stratified sampling.
