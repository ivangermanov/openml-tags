QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Neuropeptide S receptor, also known as GPR, GPRA, G protein coupled receptor, G protein coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility, and G protein coupled receptor PGR. This receptor is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Membrane receptor/Family A G protein coupled receptor/Peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Short peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Neuropeptide receptor classification.

The Neuropeptide S receptor is associated with various cellular components including the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and membrane. Its functions encompass G protein coupled receptor activity, vasopressin receptor activity, and neuropeptide receptor activity. The receptor is involved in multiple biological processes such as signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, eating behavior, regulation of calcium ion release, righting reflex, regulation of ERK and ERK cascade, and regulation of eating behavior and defecation.

This receptor is referenced in several databases including ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, GoProcess, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. It is associated with various signaling events, including peptide ligand binding receptors, G alpha (q) signaling events, and G alpha (s) signaling events.
