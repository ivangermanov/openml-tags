QSAR-TID-10692 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10692. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class features, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this source when using the data.

Demographics, geography, and MTL QSAR are essential aspects of this study.

The data shows activity values of various compounds on the drug target Angiotensin II type 2 (AT-2) receptor, also known as AGTR2, Angiotensin II type-2 receptor, AT2 receptor, and Type-2 angiotensin II receptor. This receptor belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein and a membrane receptor/family A G protein-coupled receptor/peptide receptor.

The description of the Angiotensin II type 2 receptor highlights its role as a type-2 angiotensin II receptor. It is a member of the protein family, and its mechanism of action involves being an angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist.

GO components associated with this receptor include plasma membrane and membrane. Its functions involve G protein-coupled receptor activity, angiotensin type II receptor activity, protein binding, and receptor antagonist activity. Various biological processes are linked to this receptor, including blood vessel remodeling, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and brain development.
