The QSAR-TID-17034 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17034. This dataset has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The target protein is Coagulation Factor X, also known as Activated Factor Xa Heavy Chain, Coagulation Factor X, F10, Factor X Heavy Chain, and Factor X Light Chain. This protein is an enzyme that belongs to the serine protease family and plays a crucial role in blood coagulation and hemostasis.

The protein classification of Coagulation Factor X is an enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily. It is primarily located in the extracellular region and extracellular space.

Coagulation Factor X has various functions, including serine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It is involved in several biological processes, such as proteolysis, blood coagulation, and hemostasis.
