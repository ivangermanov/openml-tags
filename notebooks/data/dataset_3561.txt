QSAR-TID-17034 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17034. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on Coagulation Factor X, a single protein that plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process.

Coagulation Factor X is a serine protease that belongs to the PA clan and S1A subfamily. It is involved in the proteolysis of various proteins, including fibrinogen, and is essential for the formation of blood clots. The protein is also known as Activated Factor Xa Heavy Chain, Coagulation Factor X, F10, Factor X Heavy Chain, and Factor X Light Chain.

The dataset provides information on the protein's structure, function, and interactions, including its extracellular region, calcium ion binding, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It also includes data on the protein's involvement in various biological processes, such as proteolysis, blood coagulation, and hemostasis.
