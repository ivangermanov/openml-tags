Localization Data for Person Activity Data Set

Abstract:
This data set contains recordings of five individuals performing various daily activities. Each participant wore four sensors, also referred to as tags, while performing the same scenario multiple times.

Dataset Title: Localization Data for Person Activity
Tags: Chemistry, Concept Drift, Life Science
Source: UCI

Data Set Information:
The participants involved in the data collection process wore four tags, specifically placed on their ankle left, ankle right, belt, and chest. Each instance in the data set represents a localization reading for one of these tags, which can be identified using specific attributes.

Attribute Information:
An instance example is comprised of the following attributes:

* Sequence Name: This attribute identifies the sequence of activities performed by each individual.
* Tag Identifier: This attribute specifies the type of tag worn by the participant, including ankle left, ankle right, belt, and chest.
* Timestamp: A unique numeric value representing the time of each reading.
* Date: The date of each reading in the format day.month.year hour:minute:second:millisecond.
* X Coordinate of the Tag: The x-axis coordinate of the tag's location.
* Y Coordinate of the Tag: The y-axis coordinate of the tag's location.
* Z Coordinate of the Tag: The z-axis coordinate of the tag's location.
* Activity: The type of activity being performed by the participant, including walking, falling, lying down, sitting, standing up, and others.

Relevant Papers:
An agent-based approach to care in independent living has been explored using this data set.
