Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

This dataset contains information related to heart health and various medical measurements. It includes features such as age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope of peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. The target variable is a binary classification of heart health status.

The data has been processed to simplify the original multi-class problem into a binary classification task, making it more suitable for certain types of analysis and machine learning applications. This transformation allows researchers to focus on distinguishing between positive and negative cases in heart health studies.
