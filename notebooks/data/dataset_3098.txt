**Tags:** Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100908. The dataset has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015.
