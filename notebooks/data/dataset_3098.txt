QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and various FCFP fingerprint bits.

The dataset is associated with the MetaQSAR project from September. It focuses on the Activin receptor type B, also known as Activin receptor like kinase or ACTR IB. This is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. The protein is classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase in the TKL protein kinase group, specifically in the TKL protein kinase STKR Type subfamily.

The Activin receptor type B is involved in various biological processes, including G/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, in utero embryonic development, hair follicle development, regulation of DNA templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and nervous system development. It plays roles in the activin receptor signaling pathway, nodal signaling pathway, and regulation of erythrocyte differentiation.

This protein has multiple molecular functions, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, activin receptor activity, growth factor binding, and SMAD binding. It is found in various cellular components including the cytosol, plasma membrane, cell surface, and activin receptor complex.

The Activin receptor type B is associated with several databases and resources, including ExpressionAtlas, GO Component, GO Function, GO Process, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
