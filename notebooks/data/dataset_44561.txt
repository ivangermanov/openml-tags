Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses random number generation to select a specified number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The function ensures that the subsample is stratified, meaning that the proportion of each class in the subsample is the same as in the original dataset.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset. It does this by getting a list of unique classes, and then using random number generation to select the specified number of classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present, and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

Next, the function selects a specified number of columns from the subsampled dataset. It does this by getting a list of column indices, and then using random number generation to select the specified number of columns. It then uses these column indices to subset the dataset.

Finally, the function selects a specified number of rows from the subsampled dataset. It does this by using the train test split function from scikit learn, which ensures that the subsample is stratified. The function then returns the subsampled dataset.
