This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase LCK. The dataset has numerous features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase LCK is a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as LCK, Leukocyte C-Terminal Src Kinase, LSK, Lymphocyte Cell-Specific Protein-Tyrosine Kinase, and p56-LCK. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TK protein kinase group/tyrosine protein kinase Src family. 

The description of this protein target classification is tyrosine-protein kinase LCK. There are numerous relationships, including accession, target type, and description. There are also several ChEMBL IDs, parent molecule names, parent molecule types, mechanisms of action, max phases, and first approvals.
