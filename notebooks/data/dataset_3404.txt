QSAR-TID-10497 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10497. It has fifty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10497. The activity values are represented in unit of pseudo-pCI fifty. 

Cathepsin L is a single protein preferred name, also known as cathepsin L, cathepsin L one, cathepsin L heavy chain, and cathepsin L light chain. It belongs to the species group Bos taurus and is classified under enzyme/protease/cysteine protease/cysteine protease CA clan/cysteine protease C one A family. 

Cathepsin L is expressed in various cellular components, including extracellular region, extracellular space, lysosome, plasma membrane, membrane, apical plasma membrane, cytoplasmic vesicle, and chromaffin granule. It performs various biological functions, such as endopeptidase activity, cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. 

It is involved in several biological processes, including proteolysis, apoptotic process, immune response, positive regulation of peptidase activity, protein autoprocessing, collagen catabolic process, zymogen activation, enkephalin processing, CD four-positive, alpha-beta T cell lineage commitment, antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen, and elastin catabolic process.
