The ALARM, A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism, is a Bayesian network designed to provide an alarm message system for patient monitoring. This alarm dataset contains thirty-seven variables, which are crucial for monitoring patients' vital signs and detecting potential health risks.

The first variable is Central Venous Pressure, which has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Similarly, Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure also has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. History is a binary variable with two levels: True and False. Total Peripheral Resistance has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Blood Pressure is another vital sign with three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Cardiac Output and Heart Rate/Blood Pressure both have three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Heart Rate measured by an Electrocardiogram monitor has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Heart Rate/Oxygen Saturation also has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Pulmonary Artery Pressure has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Arterial Oxygen Saturation has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Fraction of Inspired Oxygen is a binary variable with two levels: Low and Normal.

Breathing Pressure has four levels: Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Expelled Carbon Dioxide also has four levels: Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Minimum Volume has four levels: Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Minimum Volume Set has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Hypovolemia is a binary variable with two levels: True and False. Left Ventricular Failure and Anaphylaxis are both binary variables with two levels: True and False. Insufficient Anesthesia/Analgesia and Pulmonary Embolus are also binary variables with two levels: True and False. Intubation has three levels: Normal, Esophageal, and Onesided. Kinked Tube and Disconnection are both binary variables with two levels: True and False.

Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Volume has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Stroke Volume has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Catecholamine has two levels: Normal and High. Error Low Output is a binary variable with two levels: True and False. Heart Rate has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Electrocauter is a binary variable with two levels: True and False. Shunt has two levels: Normal and High. Pulmonary Venous Oxygen Saturation has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Arterial Carbon Dioxide has three levels: Low, Normal, and High. Pulmonary Alveoli Ventilation has four levels: Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Lung Ventilation has four levels: Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Ventilation Tube has four levels: Zero, Low, Normal, and High. Ventilation Machine has four levels: Zero, Low, Normal, and High.
