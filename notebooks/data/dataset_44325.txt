**Meta Album: Stanford Forty Actions Dataset (Extended)**

The Stanford Forty Actions dataset contains images of humans performing forty actions. There are thousands of images in total, with hundreds of images per action class. The dataset is designed for understanding human actions in still images. For Meta Album, the dataset is preprocessed, and images are resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using Open-CV.
