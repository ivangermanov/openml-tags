Name: KDD IPUMS LA Ninety Seven Small Seed Four

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD IPUMS LA Ninety Seven Small with seed equal to four, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable, and if there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects a subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, if the number of columns is more than the maximum allowed, it uniformly samples a subset of columns. If the number of rows is more than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
