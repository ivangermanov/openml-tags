GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating diverse quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, among others, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from the growing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a unified collection of microarray classification problems. This enables researchers to compare and contrast different classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly accessible Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository, managed by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is subsequently updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions.

The availability of this information translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Although multiple sources of gene expression data exist, the decision to utilize data from the expO repository was made due to several key factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the accessibility of a large number of samples for diverse tumor types.

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, please acknowledge the assistance received by utilizing this repository. This will enable others to obtain the same datasets and replicate the experiments.
