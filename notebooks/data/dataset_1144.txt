The Indian Liver Patient Dataset is a collection of medical records containing four hundred sixteen liver patient records and one hundred sixty-seven non-liver patient records. The dataset was gathered from the north-east region of Andhra Pradesh, India. The class label categorizes the patients into two distinct groups, namely liver patients and non-liver patients.

This comprehensive dataset encompasses four hundred forty-one male patient records and one hundred forty-two female patient records. The attributes included in this dataset provide valuable insights into various aspects of liver health.

The first attribute represents the age of the patient, with any patient exceeding eighty-nine years of age being listed as ninety years old. The second attribute denotes the gender of the patient.

Subsequent attributes include total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total proteins, albumin, and albumin and globulin ratio. These attributes collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of liver function and health.

Relevant papers exploring the Indian Liver Patient Dataset have been published, examining various facets of liver disease diagnosis and comparative analysis between liver patients in the United States and India.
