Name: BNG Vehicle

Tags: Features

This vehicle is characterized by its compactness, circularity, and ability to maintain a consistent distance from its circular path. The ratio of its radius to its overall size is also a notable feature. Additionally, the vehicle's axis aspect ratio, maximum length aspect ratio, and scatter ratio are important characteristics. Its elongatedness and rectangularity, both in terms of its principal axis and maximum length, are also significant features.

Furthermore, the vehicle's scaled variance in both major and minor axes, as well as its scaled radius of gyration, provide valuable insights into its behavior. The skewness and kurtosis of the vehicle's movement about its major and minor axes are also important aspects to consider. Finally, the vehicle's hollows ratio is a key feature that sets it apart from others.
