**Meta-Album RSICB Micro Dataset**

The Meta-Album RSICB Micro Dataset is a remote sensing dataset consisting of forty-five scene categories, comprising a total of thirty-six thousand images with a resolution of one hundred twenty-eight pixels by one hundred twenty-eight pixels. The data authors have selected various locations worldwide and followed China's land-use classification standard. This collection has a two-level label hierarchy with six supercategories: Agricultural Land, Construction Land and Facilities, Transportation and Facilities, Water and Water Conservancy Facilities, Woodland, and Other Lands.
