Inspiration

This is a very fun dataset to explore and find out unique links which land songs in the top tracks. With this dataset, I wanted to be able to answer some questions like: Which genres were more popular over the years? Songs of which genre mostly saw themselves landing in the top tracks? Which artists were more likely to make a top song? Songs containing which words are more popular? What is the average tempo of songs compared over the years? Is there a trend of acoustic songs being popular back in the day versus now? Is there a trend in genres preferred back in the day versus now?
