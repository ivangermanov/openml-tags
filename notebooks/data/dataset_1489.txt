The phoneme dataset aims to distinguish between nasal (class zero) and oral sounds (class one). Five attributes characterize each vowel: the amplitudes of the first five harmonics normalized by total energy. The phonemes are transcribed as follows: "sh" as in she, "dcl" as in dark, "iy" as the vowel in she, "aa" as the vowel in dark, and "ao" as the first vowel in water.

This dataset was formatted by the KEEL repository but originally hosted by the ELENA Project. It originates from the European ESPRIT project: ROARS, which aimed to develop and implement a real-time analytical system for French and Spanish speech recognition.

Most existing speech recognition systems are global systems that recognize signals without fully utilizing speech specificities. In contrast, analytical systems consider the articulatory process leading to different phonemes, aiming to deduce phonetic features from acoustic observations. The main challenge for analytical systems is obtaining reliable acoustical parameters that contain all relevant phonetic information, are speaker and context-independent, and robust to noise.

The primary acoustical observation is voluminous, involving spectrum analysis at multiple observation moments. In ROARS, the initial database uses cochlear spectra, simulating the frequency response of auditory nerves. Filters' outputs are taken every two or eight milliseconds, depending on whether the observed phoneme is stationary or transitory.

This database contains vowels from isolated syllables. Five attributes characterize each vowel: the amplitudes of the first five harmonics, normalized by total energy. Each harmonic is signed positively when corresponding to a local spectrum maximum, and negatively otherwise. Three observation moments are kept for each vowel: the maximum total energy point and eight milliseconds before and after this point.

From the initial values, instances where the amplitude of the first five harmonics was zero were removed, resulting in the final dataset. The patterns are presented in random order.

The dataset has been used in various studies, including periodic progress reports, deliverables for enhanced learning projects, and research on statistical neural networks for high-dimensional vector classification.
