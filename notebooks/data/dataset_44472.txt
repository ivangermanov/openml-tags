Tags: Subsampling of the dataset yeast with seed equals four arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals false

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects the data and target arrays from the dataset. If the number of unique classes in the target array is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of each class. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data and target arrays accordingly. If the number of columns in the data array is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of rows in the data array is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. Finally, it returns a new dataset with the subsampled data and target arrays, along with the categorical mask and column names.
