Texture Database

Summary
This database was generated by the Laboratory of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition in the development of the Esprit project ELENA. The original source is P. Brodatz "Textures: A Photographic Album for Artists and Designers", Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1966. The database was created to study the textures discrimination with high order statistics.

Past Usage
This database has a private usage at the TIRF laboratory. It has been created in order to study the textures discrimination with high order statistics.

Relevant Information
The aim is to distinguish between eleven different textures, each pattern being characterized by forty attributes built by the estimation of fourth order modified moments in four orientations: zero, forty-five, ninety and one hundred thirty-five degrees. A statistical method based on the extraction of fourth order moments for the characterization of natural micro-textures was developed called "fourth order modified moments" (mm4), this method measures the deviation from first-order Gauss-Markov process, for each texture. The features were estimated in four directions to take into account the possible orientations of the textures. Only correlation between the current pixel, the first neighborhood and the second neighborhood are taken into account. This small neighborhood is adapted to the fine grain property of the textures. The data set contains eleven classes of five hundred instances and each class refers to a type of texture in the Brodatz album. The database dimension is forty plus one for the class label.

Class
The class label is a code for the following classes: Grass lawn, Pressed calf leather, Handmade paper, Raffia looped to a high pile, Cotton canvas, Pigskin, Beach sand, Oriental straw cloth, and Oriental grass fiber cloth.

Summary Statistics
The dynamic of the attributes is in a range of negative one point four five to zero point seven seven five. The database resulting from the centering and reduction by attribute of the Texture database is available.

Confusion Matrix
The following confusion matrix of the k_NN classifier was obtained with a Leave_One_Out error counting method on the texture_CR database. The k was set to one in order to reach the minimum mean error rate.

Result of the Principal Component Analysis
The Principal Components Analysis is a very classical method in pattern recognition. PCA reduces the sample dimension in a linear way for the best representation in lower dimensions keeping the maximum of inertia. The best axe for the representation is however not necessary the best axe for the discrimination. After PCA, features are selected according to the percentage of initial inertia which is covered by the different axes and the number of features is determined according to the percentage of initial inertia to keep for the classification process. This selection method has been applied on the texture_CR database. When quasi-linear correlations exist between some initial features, these redundant dimensions are removed by PCA and this preprocessing is then recommended. In this case, before a PCA, the determinant of the data covariance matrix is near zero; this database is thus badly conditioned for all process which use this information.
