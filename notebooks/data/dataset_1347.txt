This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset provides information about the compounds, including their molecular structure, chemical properties, and biological activities. The molecular fingerprints are used to describe the chemical structure of the compounds, allowing for the prediction of their biological activities.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project enables researchers to access and analyze large amounts of QSAR data, facilitating the discovery of new drugs and understanding of biological systems.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its name, synonyms, and classification. The drug target is a melanocortin receptor three, which is a single protein preferred name. It has various synonyms and is classified into different categories based on its function and location.

The dataset also provides information about the gene ontology of the drug target, including its cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The gene ontology provides a framework for understanding the functions and processes of genes and their products.
