Context 
People love movies because they take you on a journey, providing an escape from reality. As a vivid movie watcher, I am always amazed by how websites like Netflix and Hotstar seem to exactly suggest the next movie I had planned to watch on the back of my mind.

I researched extensively and decided to create something similar. To begin, I started by extracting a massive dataset of movies that people love to watch and applying analysis on it.

The Top 10000 Movies Based On Ratings dataset contains the following information:

Popularity - a measure of how well-known the movie is; 
Vote Count - the total number of people who have voted for the movie; 
Title - the name of the movie; 
Vote Average - the average rating given by viewers who have watched the movie; 
Overview - a brief summary of the movie's storyline; 
Release Date - the date when the movie was initially released.

Inspiration 
I would love to uncover answers to questions such as: What is the relationship between a movie's popularity and its average vote count?

Which machine learning algorithm would be most effective in finding relationships between different movies?
