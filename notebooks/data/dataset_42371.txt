Conventional and Social Media Movies Dataset

The Conventional and Social Media Movies dataset is a collection of data that combines conventional features from movie databases on the web with social media features from YouTube and Twitter. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of movies, including their ratings, genre, gross revenue, budget, and number of screens, as well as their performance on social media platforms.

The dataset includes a range of features, such as the movie title, year of release, ratings, genre, gross revenue, budget, number of screens, and whether it is a sequel. Additionally, it includes social media features, such as sentiment analysis, views, likes, dislikes, comments, and aggregate followers.

The data was scraped from Twitter, YouTube, and IMDB, and it has missing values. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and analysts who want to study the relationship between conventional movie metrics and social media performance.
