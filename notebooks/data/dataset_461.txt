The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

These datasets are generated using the Friedman function, which includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, and a normalized noise term is added to the output. The Friedman function takes the form of:

Output = ten times sine of pi times input one times input two plus twenty times input three minus point five squared equals ten times input four plus five times input five plus error.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. However, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity. 

Colinearity refers to the number of features that depend on other features. The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values are as follows:

The number of features varies, including five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random.

The number of samples also varies, including one hundred, two hundred fifty, five hundred, and one thousand.

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
