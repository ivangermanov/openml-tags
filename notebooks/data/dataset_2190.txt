The QSAR-TID-101434 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Receptor-interacting Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Four. This dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction. The Receptor-interacting Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Four is a single protein target classified under the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TKL protein kinase group/TKL protein kinase RIPK family.

The target classification includes enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TKL protein kinase group, and TKL protein kinase RIPK family. The description of this target highlights its relationship with other proteins and its role in various biological processes.

The dataset provides information on the synonyms of the target, including Ankyrin Repeat Domain-Containing Protein Three, DIK, and PKC-Delta-Interacting Protein Kinase. It also provides information on the species group, which is Homo sapiens.

The dataset includes data on the component, function, and process of the target. The component includes cytoplasm and membrane, while the function includes nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

The process includes morphogenesis of an epithelium, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, and positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity.
