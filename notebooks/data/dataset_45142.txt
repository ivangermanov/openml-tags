Insurance Bayesian Network Sample

The Insurance Bayesian Network is a sample Bayesian network repository reference, which is a discrete-medium model. This network consists of twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with a total of one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point one nine, and the average degree is approximately three point eight five. The maximum in-degree is three.

This Bayesian network is a representation of an insurance domain, which models various factors that influence the cost of insurance premiums. The network captures the relationships between different variables, such as the driver's history, driving skills, age, and other factors related to the vehicle and the driver.

The Insurance Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis. It provides a comprehensive and structured representation of the insurance domain, which can be used for various purposes, such as predicting insurance premiums, identifying risk factors, and optimizing insurance policies.
