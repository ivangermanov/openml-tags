Name: Eye Movements Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the dataset. The function first samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function samples the columns uniformly if required, selecting a specified number of columns randomly. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function stratifies the data accordingly and splits it into a subset of the specified size.

The function returns a new dataset with the sampled data, including the categorical mask and column names.
