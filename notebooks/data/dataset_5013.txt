**Diabetes Bayesian Network**

This network is a sample Bayesian network for diabetes, which is a machine learning model used in life science research. The network has been created using the bnlearn package.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network has a large number of nodes, representing various factors related to diabetes, including meal intake, blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and other physiological processes.

The network structure consists of a complex web of relationships between these factors, represented by arcs, which capture the probabilistic dependencies between them. Each node has a set of parameters associated with it, which define the probability distribution over its possible states.

The average Markov blanket size, which measures the complexity of the local probability distributions, is relatively small, indicating that each node is influenced by only a few neighboring nodes. Similarly, the average degree, which measures the number of edges incident on each node, is also relatively small.

The maximum in-degree, which represents the maximum number of parents any node has, is low, suggesting that the network does not have highly connected hubs.

**Features**

The network includes a wide range of features related to diabetes, including meal intake, blood glucose levels, insulin absorption, insulin sensitivity, gut absorption, renal clearance, glucose production, and others.
