The QSAR-TID-176 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 176. This dataset has nine hundred six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID feature represents the unique identifier for each molecule in the dataset. The MEDIAN_PXC50 feature represents the median pXC50 value for each molecule.

The remaining one thousand twenty-four features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is related to the life sciences and economics fields, specifically in the area of QSAR modeling and drug discovery.
