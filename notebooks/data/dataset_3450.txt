QSAR-TID-176 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 176. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains nine hundred and six rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The drug target TID: 176 is a Purinergic receptor P2Y12, which is a single protein target. It is also known as ADP-glucose receptor, ADPG-R, HORK3, P2RY12, and P2T(AC). It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, Small molecule receptor, and Nucleotide-like receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including G protein-coupled adenosine receptor signaling pathway, monoatomic ion transport, substrate-dependent cell migration, cell extension, signal transduction, and blood coagulation.

The dataset provides information on various compounds that interact with the Purinergic receptor P2Y12, including their activity values and molecular fingerprints. This information can be used to develop predictive models for identifying new compounds that interact with the receptor.
