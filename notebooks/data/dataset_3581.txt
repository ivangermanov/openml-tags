QSAR-TID-10580 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10580. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The drug target is a C-C chemokine receptor type five, also known as CCR five. It is a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as C-C chemokine receptor type five, C-C CKR-five, CC-CKR-five, CCR five, and CCR-five. 

It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR chemokine receptor CC chemokine receptor. 

This receptor is involved in various biological processes such as virus receptor activity, actin binding, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, chemokine receptor activity, protein binding, coreceptor activity, C-C chemokine receptor activity, C-C chemokine binding, and identical protein binding.

It is also associated with various cellular components such as cytoplasm, endosome, plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, cell surface, and membrane.

Keywords: QSAR, C-C chemokine receptor, CCR5, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Homo sapiens, G protein-coupled receptor, chemokine receptor, virus receptor activity, actin binding, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C activity.
