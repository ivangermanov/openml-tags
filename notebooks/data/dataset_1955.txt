Tags: Chemistry, Medicine, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Androgen Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP six molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.
