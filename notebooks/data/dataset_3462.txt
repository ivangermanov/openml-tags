QSAR-TID-175 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter One, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter One. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

The Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter One is a single protein, also known as ENT One, and is a member of the Solute Carrier Family Twenty-Nine of Nucleoside Transporters. It is responsible for the transport of nucleosides and free purine and pyrimidine bases across the plasma membrane.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, and Reactome. It contains information on the protein target, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also contains information on the compounds, including their ChEMBL ID, parent molecule name, parent molecule type, mechanism of action, and maximum phase.
