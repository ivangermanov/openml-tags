Name: yprop Tags: Drug design, Molecular descriptors, QSAR

This dataset is one of drug design datasets formed using Adriana.Code software. The datasets contain features derived from molecular structures and properties. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies on various drug compounds and chemical properties.

The dataset focuses on quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) for different classes of molecules. It includes data on carbolenes, melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, and various other drug-like compounds.

Multiple original studies are referenced, covering topics such as molecular descriptors influencing melting points, diversity descriptors, pharmacological evaluations, QSAR analyses, toxicity predictions, biodegradability relationships, and structure-function relationships of modified proteins.

The features in the dataset represent various molecular descriptors and properties calculated using computational methods. These descriptors capture information about the chemical structure, physical properties, and potential biological activity of the compounds.

This dataset can be used for developing and benchmarking predictive models in drug design, toxicology, and other areas of computational chemistry and cheminformatics. It provides a valuable resource for researchers working on structure-activity relationships and property prediction of drug-like molecules.
