QSAR-TID-11752 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11752. The dataset has 985 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.

The drug target is Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 3, which is a single protein. It is also known as FLT4, FLT-4, Fms-like Tyrosine Kinase 4, Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor FLT4, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 3.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, vasculature development, lymph vessel development, lymphangiogenesis, and respiratory system process. It is also involved in protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway.

The receptor has been implicated in various diseases, including lymphedema, hereditary I, and Milory disease.
