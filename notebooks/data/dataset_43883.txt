MNE Sample MEG Auditory Data Tags: MEG data from auditory stimulation experiment using three hundred and five sensors.

The design matrix or forward operator is comprised of the first seven thousand four hundred and ninety-eight columns of the data. The measurements for left stimulation are contained in columns seven thousand four hundred and ninety-eight to seven thousand five hundred and eighty-three. The measurements for right stimulation are found in the remaining columns.

This data was generated using the following script:

The script utilized the MNE library, version one point zero point two, to read in the necessary data files, including the forward solution, noise covariance matrix, and evoked responses. The forward solution was read in from a file, and the noise covariance matrix was also read in from a separate file. The evoked responses were read in from another file, and then cropped to a specific time range.

The script then handled the forward solution by preparing the gain matrix, which was used to whiten the data. The whitened data was then stored in a dictionary, with separate entries for the left and right auditory conditions.

The final data array was created by horizontally stacking the gain matrix with the whitened data for the left and right auditory conditions.
