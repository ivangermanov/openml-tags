**DB World Bodies Stemmed**

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset consists of sixty-four emails collected from the DB World newsletter. The emails were used to train various algorithms to classify between announcements of conferences and everything else. A binary bag-of-words representation was employed, with a stop-word removal pre-processing task performed beforehand.

Each attribute in this dataset corresponds to a specific word or stem in the entire dataset vocabulary, which was obtained through a bag-of-words representation.

The dataset is relevant to the paper titled "DB World Email Classification Using a Very Small Corpus," a project of the Machine Learning course at the University of Manchester.
