This dataset is based on the Retail Dataset. Historical sales data covers a period of approximately two years. The sales and features data were merged, and weekly sales were estimated at the total store level. Only data for Store Twenty was selected.

The columns include the following:

Date, which represents the week; 
Temperature, which is the average temperature in the region; 
Fuel Price, which is the cost of fuel in the region; 
Markdowns One through Five, which are anonymized data related to promotional markdowns. Note that Markdown data is only available after November of the year and is not available for all stores at all times. Any missing values are marked as Not Available;
CPI, which stands for Consumer Price Index;
Unemployment, which is the unemployment rate;
Is Holiday, which indicates whether the week is a special holiday week; 
and Weekly Sales, which represents sales in the given date or week.

The original dataset was obtained from the Retail Dataset.

Features include Date, whether it is a Holiday, Weekly Sales, Temperature, Fuel Price, Markdowns, Consumer Price Index, and Unemployment.
