QSAR-TID-10081 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10081. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10081. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, and PDBe. The target protein is Alpha-chymotrypsin, which is a single protein with multiple synonyms, including Chymotrypsin A chain A, Chymotrypsin A chain B, and Chymotrypsin A chain C. The protein is classified as an enzyme, protease, and serine protease, and is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and digestion.

The dataset contains multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP6 1024, and Median PXc50. The features are generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.
