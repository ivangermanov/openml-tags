**Water Bayesian Network. Sample.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete-medium model. This network consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of ten thousand and eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, and the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

The Water Bayesian Network is a pilot project for an expert system for control of waste water treatment. This network is a comprehensive model that represents the complex relationships between various factors in the waste water treatment process.
