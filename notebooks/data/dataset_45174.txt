**Water Bayesian Network. Sample**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete medium network. This network has thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, resulting in ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

This network was created for the purpose of an expert system for control of waste water treatment. It is a pilot project that aims to provide a solution for managing waste water treatment.

The network features various nodes, including those related to chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, and biochemical oxygen demand. These nodes are interconnected to represent the relationships between different factors affecting waste water treatment.
