Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi class target feature is converted to a two class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes labeled as "att" followed by numbers, as well as a binary class feature. The specific attributes are not described in detail.

The mfeat zernike dataset is a modified version of an original multi class dataset. It has been transformed into a binary classification problem by recategorizing the data points. The majority class has been designated as the positive class, while all other classes have been grouped together as the negative class. This binarization process allows for simplified analysis and modeling of the data in a two category framework. The dataset likely contains various numerical features that describe characteristics of the original data objects, though the exact nature of these features is not specified. Researchers using this dataset should be aware of its derived nature and cite it appropriately in their work.
