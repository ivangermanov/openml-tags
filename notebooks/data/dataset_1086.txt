Ovarian Tumor Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

This dataset contains samples characterized by values of various attributes, which are measurements from DNA microarrays. The attributes are numeric and have been normalized in some way, resulting in similar distributions of attribute values throughout the dataset. 

The dataset consists of multiple classes, ranging from two to ten, each with its unique characteristics. The number of samples varies, but all datasets contain between one hundred and four hundred samples. 

Features include various variables, such as gene expressions, which are crucial in understanding the biology of ovarian tumors. These variables have been carefully selected to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease.
