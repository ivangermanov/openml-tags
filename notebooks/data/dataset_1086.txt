Please cite: Data from the RSCTC Discovery Challenge. All datasets contain between and samples, characterized by values of attributes. Samples are assigned to several classes. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA microarrays. Attributes are normalized in some way - in test data you should expect similar distributions of attribute values as in the example data.
