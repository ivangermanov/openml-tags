Machine Learning and Mathematics Subsampling of the dataset Amazon Commerce Reviews 

The dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to stratify or not. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall structure.

The dataset is first reduced to include only the specified maximum number of classes, which are chosen randomly based on their frequency in the dataset. Then, the dataset is further reduced to include only the specified maximum number of columns, which are also chosen randomly. Finally, the dataset is reduced to include only the specified maximum number of rows, while ensuring that the class distribution is maintained through stratification.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, including various attributes related to Amazon commerce reviews.
