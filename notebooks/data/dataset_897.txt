The KC3 dataset is a part of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, specifically designed for software defect prediction. This dataset contains unknown types of software, with data extracted from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were initially defined in the 1970s to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Attribute Information:

* Line Count of Code: a numerical value representing McCabe's line count of code
* Cyclomatic Complexity: a numerical value representing McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
* Essential Complexity: a numerical value representing McCabe's essential complexity
* Design Complexity: a numerical value representing McCabe's design complexity
* Total Operators and Operands: a numerical value representing Halstead's total operators plus operands
* Volume: a numerical value representing Halstead's volume
* Program Length: a numerical value representing Halstead's program length
* Difficulty: a numerical value representing Halstead's difficulty
* Intelligence: a numerical value representing Halstead's intelligence
* Effort: a numerical value representing Halstead's effort
* Time Estimator: a numerical value representing Halstead's time estimator
* Line Count: a numerical value representing Halstead's line count
* Lines of Comments: a numerical value representing Halstead's count of lines of comments
* Blank Lines: a numerical value representing Halstead's count of blank lines
* Code and Comment: a numerical value representing Halstead's code and comment
* Unique Operators: a numerical value representing unique operators
* Unique Operands: a numerical value representing unique operands
* Total Operators: a numerical value representing total operators
* Total Operands: a numerical value representing total operands
* Branch Count: a numerical value representing the number of branches in the flow graph
* Problems: a boolean value indicating whether the module has one or more reported defects
