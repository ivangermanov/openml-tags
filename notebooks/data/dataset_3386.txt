QSAR-TID-104385 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 104385. The dataset has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 104385. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor, which is a single protein target.

The Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor family. It is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle contraction.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization.
