Pigs Bayesian Network. Sample Four.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a comprehensive database of Bayesian networks.

This particular network, known as Pigs, consists of four hundred forty-one nodes and five hundred ninety-two arcs, resulting in a total of five thousand six hundred eighteen parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point six six, and the average degree is two point six eight. The maximum in-degree is two.

Some of the notable features of this network include various characteristics of pigs, such as their physical attributes and behaviors.

The Pigs Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists studying Bayesian networks and their applications.
