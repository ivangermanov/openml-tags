QSAR-TID-101612 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101612. The dataset has ninety-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101612. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has ninety-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the serine/threonine-protein kinase MARK1, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase one and is involved in various biological processes, including microtubule cytoskeleton organization, neuron migration, and protein phosphorylation.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the protein in different tissues and cell types, as well as its subcellular localization. It also includes information on the protein's function, including its role in the Wnt signaling pathway and its interaction with other proteins.
