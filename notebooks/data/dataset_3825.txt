The QSAR-TID-101612 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101612. This dataset has ninety-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains molecular fingerprints that encode molecular structure information into a binary format. Each fingerprint represents a specific molecular structure, allowing for the comparison and analysis of different molecules.

The dataset also includes information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, and classification. The target is a single protein, specifically a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about the target's function, including its role in microtubule cytoskeleton organization, neuron migration, and protein phosphorylation. It also includes information about the target's process, such as positive regulation of gene expression and negative regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug target, serine/threonine-protein kinase, microtubule cytoskeleton organization, protein phosphorylation.
