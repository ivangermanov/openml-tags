At Shadow Robot, we are leaders in robotic grasping and manipulation. As part of our Smart Grasping System development, we are developing different algorithms using machine learning. This first public dataset, known as Grasping Dataset, was created to investigate the use of machine learning to predict the stability of a grasp.

Due to the limitations of the current simulation, it is a restricted dataset, focusing solely on grasping a ball. The dataset is annotated with an objective grasp quality and contains various data gathered from the joints, including position, velocity, and effort.

You can find detailed explanations for this dataset on Medium. We would be delighted to discuss this dataset further and explore which datasets you would like to work with to tackle real-world robotic problems focused on grasping using machine learning. Let's connect on social media platforms to exchange ideas!

Features include experiment number, robustness measurement, joint positions, velocities, efforts, and other relevant metrics.
