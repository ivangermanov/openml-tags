Data Description 
This is the historical price data of the Forex Euro/New Zealand Dollar from Dukascopy. One instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans a specific period of time and does not include weekends, since the Forex market is not traded on weekends. The time zone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam.

The class attribute is the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following day, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is expected to increase the following day, and false when the mean High price is expected to decrease or remain the same the following day.

Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trade strategies can only be applied to predictions on Close attributes, which are also available.
