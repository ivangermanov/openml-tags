The SportsCars dataset comprises information about various cars, including their brand, type, and model. For each car, we have details about the engine's cubic capacity, maximum power, and maximum torque. Additionally, we know the number of seats, the car's weight, and its maximum engine speed. The dataset also includes information about the car's acceleration from zero to one hundred kilometers per hour, as well as its top speed. Furthermore, each car is classified as either a sports car or not, and we have a tau value associated with it.

This dataset is based on the article "What is a Sports Car" and has been extended with additional cars compiled from the internet. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various sports cars, allowing for analysis and comparison of their features.
