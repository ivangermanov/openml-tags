Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on vehicle-related information and includes various features for analysis. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, where instances are categorized into two classes based on their target values. This transformation allows for easier application of certain machine learning algorithms and statistical analyses.

The dataset covers several aspects related to vehicles and their operators, including alcohol-related factors, gender information, vehicle types, and age demographics. These features provide a comprehensive view of the data points, enabling researchers to explore potential correlations and patterns within the vehicular context.

By converting the original numeric target feature into a binary classification, the dataset facilitates studies in areas such as predictive modeling, risk assessment, and demographic analysis related to vehicle usage and ownership. This binarized version offers a simplified approach to complex vehicular data, making it suitable for various analytical purposes and hypothesis testing.
