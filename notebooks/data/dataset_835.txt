The MFEAT-Zernike dataset has been modified to create a binarized version of the original data set. This alteration involved converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. Specifically, the majority class has been relabeled as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all other classes have been categorized as Negative, represented by 'N'. 

This dataset comprises forty-seven attributes, which have been designated as follows: attribute one, attribute two,..., attribute forty-seven. These attributes have been retained in their original form.

The MFEAT-Zernike dataset is classified under the tags Chemistry, Life Science, MythBusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, and Study Seven.
