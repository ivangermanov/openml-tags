QSAR-TID-10695 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10695. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1292 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase AKT2, also known as Protein Kinase B Beta or RAC-Beta Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase. It is a protein kinase that plays a key role in various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism.

The dataset can be used for developing QSAR models to predict the activity of compounds against Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase AKT2.
