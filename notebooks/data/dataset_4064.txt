Elevators 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark, specifically belonging to the regression on numerical features category. It was transformed in a similar manner to other datasets in the benchmark.

The Elevators dataset originates from the task of controlling an F Sixteen aircraft, with a distinct target variable and attributes compared to the Ailerons domain. The primary objective of this dataset is related to actions taken on the elevators of the aircraft.

Features include Climb Rate, Angle of Attack, Roll, Pitch, Current Roll, Absolute Roll, Climb Rate Difference, Roll Rate Difference, Second Derivative Climb Rate, Sensor Activation Time One, Sensor Activation Time Two, Sensor Activation Time Three, Sensor Activation Time Four, Difference in Sensor Activation Time One, Difference in Sensor Activation Time Three, Sensor Output, and Goal.
