The QSAR-TID-10695 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10695. This dataset has 1292 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and machine learning applications. The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are a type of molecular descriptor that encodes the structural information of molecules into a binary vector format.

The compounds in this dataset are targeted towards the serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT2, also known as protein kinase Akt-2 or protein kinase B beta. This enzyme plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell survival, metabolism, and proliferation.

The activity values in this dataset are expressed in terms of pseudo-pIC50, which is a measure of the potency of a compound in inhibiting the target enzyme. The higher the pIC50 value, the more potent the compound is in inhibiting the enzyme.

This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and machine learning applications, particularly those focused on the development of inhibitors against the serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT2.
