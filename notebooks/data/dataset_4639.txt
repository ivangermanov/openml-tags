Subsampling of the First Order Theorem Proving dataset with a specified seed value generates a new dataset. This process involves uniform sampling of classes, columns, and rows.

The function takes several arguments, including the seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. 

Uniform sampling of classes is performed by selecting a specified number of unique classes from the dataset. The indices where these classes are present are then used to select the corresponding data points. 

Next, uniform sampling of columns is performed by randomly selecting a specified number of column indices. The selected columns are then used to create a new dataset.

Finally, stratified sampling of rows is performed using a train-test split function. This ensures that the sampled data maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset contains the sampled data, along with metadata such as the categorical mask and column names.
