Data on the homicide rate in Detroit for the years. This is the data set called DETROIT in the book 'Subset selection in regression' published in the Chapman & Hall series of monographs on Statistics & Applied Probability. The data are unusual in that a subset of three predictors can be found which gives a very much better fit to the data than the subsets found from the Efroymson stepwise algorithm, or from forward selection or backward elimination. The original data were given in appendix A of 'Regression analysis and its application: A data oriented approach', Statistics textbooks and monographs, Marcel Dekker. It has caused problems because some copies of the book do not contain all of the data, and because it does not say which variables were used as predictors and which is the dependent variable. (HOM was the dependent variable, and the predictors were FTP to WE) The data were collected and used in a paper: "Homicide in Detroit: The Role of Firearms", Criminology.
