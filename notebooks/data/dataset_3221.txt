The QSAR-TID-17120 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17120. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes various features, such as molecule ChEMBL ID, median PXC fifty, and numerous other fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide high-quality QSAR data for machine learning and statistical modeling. The data was scraped from ChEMBL version seventeen and includes information about the cholecystokinin A receptor, also known as CCK one R, CCK AR, CCK one receptor, cholecystokinin one receptor, and other synonyms.

The cholecystokinin A receptor is a single protein and a member of the family A G protein-coupled receptor group. It is primarily located in the nucleoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and membrane. This receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including neuron migration, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, axonogenesis, forebrain development, and cholecystokinin signaling pathway.
