QSAR-TID-17120 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17120. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17120. The data is represented by multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50, which are used to describe the activity values of the compounds.

The features in the dataset are FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This method does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets.
