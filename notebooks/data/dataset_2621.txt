The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified outdoor game. In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. 

In this particular case, there are four attributes that describe each instance in the dataset. These attributes are the overall outlook, the temperature, the level of humidity, and whether it is windy or not. The outcome or target variable is whether the conditions are suitable to play or not.
