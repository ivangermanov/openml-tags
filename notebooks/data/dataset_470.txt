The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". This dataset is one of the most widely used functions for generating data. 

Friedman functions encompass both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is as follows: output equals ten times the sine of pi times input one times input two plus twenty times the square of input three minus point five squared plus ten times input four plus five times input five plus noise.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. 

The collinearity degree is the number of features dependent on other features. The generated Friedman dataset's parameters are given below:

The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, where only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand. 

Collinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features ranges from ten to one hundred. The other datasets have five to fifty features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees.
