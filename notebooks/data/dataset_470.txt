This dataset, named "profb", contains information on professional football scores and related statistics. It aims to investigate questions about oddsmakers' predictions, home field advantage, effects of Monday night games, and benefits of bye weeks in the National Football League (NFL).

The data covers all regular season NFL games from three seasons, compiled to analyze various aspects of game outcomes and betting spreads. It includes variables related to the oddsmakers' point spread, which serves as a handicap for the perceived better team in each matchup. The point spread theoretically represents an expert prediction of the game's outcome, though in practice it often indicates a point at which equal amounts of money would be wagered on both teams.

Variables in the dataset include whether the favored team is playing at home or away, points scored by both the favored and underdog teams, the point spread, team name codes, year, week of the season, and special designations for games played on particular days or in overtime.

This data can be used to explore the accuracy of oddsmakers' predictions, the magnitude of home field advantage, potential disadvantages for teams playing shortly after a Monday night game, and the impact of bye weeks on team performance.

The dataset contains hundreds of cases, covering all regular season games for the included seasons. It provides a rich source of information for statistical analysis of professional football outcomes and betting markets.
