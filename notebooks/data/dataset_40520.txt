BNG Anneal

Tags: Artificial, Study

Automated file upload of BNG Anneal features a comprehensive dataset that encompasses various aspects of steel products. This dataset focuses on the family of steel products, specifically carbon steel, and its properties such as hardness, temper rolling, and condition. The formability and strength of the steel are also examined, along with its non-ageing characteristics. Furthermore, the surface finish and surface quality are evaluated, including enamelability.

The dataset also explores the chemical composition of the steel, including boron, carbon, chromium, phosphorus, and other elements. Additionally, it examines the corrosion resistance and blue bright varnish clean properties of the steel.

The physical characteristics of the steel are also documented, including shape, thickness, width, length, and oil bore. The packing and class of the steel are also included in the dataset.
