Data Set Information: 
Dota 2 is a popular computer game with two teams of five players. At the start of the game, each player chooses a unique hero with different strengths and weaknesses. The dataset is reasonably sparse as only ten of one hundred thirteen possible heroes are chosen in a given game. All games were played in a space of two hours on the thirteenth of August, two thousand sixteen. 

The data was collected using a web link. 

Attribute Information: 
Each row of the dataset is a single game with the following features in the order in the vector: 
Team that won the game, Cluster Identification related to location, Game mode, such as All Pick, and Game type, such as Ranked. 
Each element is an indicator for a hero. The value of one indicates that a player from team one played as that hero, and negative one for the other team. A hero can be selected by only one player each game. This means that each row has five ones and five negative ones values.
