The RSCTC 2010 Four Dataset is categorized under the tags of Chemistry, Computational Universe, and MF Less Than Eighty. This dataset is part of the study one twenty-three and is sourced from the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge.

This dataset contains example datasets for six different problems of DNA microarray data analysis and classification. The datasets hold gene expression data characterized by values of various attributes. The samples are assigned to several classes, ranging from two to ten. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements obtained from DNA microarrays.

The dataset provides an extensive range of variables, although they are not explicitly defined due to their technical nature. These variables are essential for understanding the complexities of DNA microarray data analysis and classification.
