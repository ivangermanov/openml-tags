Please cite: Data from the RSCTC Discovery Challenge. Example datasets for several different problems of DNA microarray data analysis and classification. All datasets contain gene expression data characterized by values of numerous attributes. Samples are assigned to multiple classes. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA microarrays.
