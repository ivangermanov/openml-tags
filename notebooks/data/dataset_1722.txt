The QSAR-TID-101237 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101237, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is specifically designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for galanin receptor two, a single protein preferred name that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The galanin receptor two is primarily involved in signal transduction pathways, including G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and neuropeptide signaling pathways. It also plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, such as neuron projection development, phosphatidylinositol metabolic process, and positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.

The dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore the structure-activity relationships of compounds interacting with galanin receptor two, enabling researchers to design and develop novel therapeutic agents targeting this receptor.
