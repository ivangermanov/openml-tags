Visualizing Galaxy Dataset

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This allows for a more simplified analysis of the data.

The features included in this dataset are East West Orientation, North South Orientation, Angle, and Radial Position, which have been carefully selected to provide meaningful insights into the galaxy's structure and behavior.
