Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled oz one through oz fifty, along with a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification task. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean threshold, respectively.

The dataset is associated with various studies and mythbusting efforts, suggesting it may have been used in multiple research contexts or to challenge existing assumptions in a particular field. The exact nature of these studies and the specific myths being addressed are not provided in the given information.

The origin and creation date of this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper data provenance and documentation in research and data science practices. Users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, though specific citation instructions are not provided.

The features in this dataset are labeled with abstract names (oz one through oz fifty), which may indicate that they represent measurements or attributes that have been anonymized or abstracted from their original context. This naming convention could be used to protect sensitive information or to focus analysis on the underlying patterns rather than specific real world variables.
