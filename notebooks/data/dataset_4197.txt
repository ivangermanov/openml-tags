Tags: Computer Systems, Medicine 

This multi-omics bladder cancer dataset contains complete modality samples from the TCGA project. It features patient identification information, overall survival rates, overall survival days, age at initial pathologic diagnosis, gender, race, AJCC pathologic tumor stage, clinical stage, histological type, and gene expression data. 

The gene expression data includes genes involved in various biological processes, such as metabolism, cell signaling, and protein synthesis. These genes have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and may serve as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the molecular landscape of bladder cancer, enabling researchers to identify new therapeutic targets and develop personalized medicine approaches.
