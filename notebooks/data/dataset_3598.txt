The QSAR-TID-10439 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on a specific drug target. This dataset has been extracted from ChEMBL version seventeen and consists of one hundred forty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature representing the median pseudo-pCI50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. As generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, all bits were generated.

The dataset includes molecule identifiers and molecular fingerprints. These molecular fingerprints capture structural information about the molecules, allowing for the analysis of their properties and activities.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets.
