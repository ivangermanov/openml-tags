Timing Attack Dataset: Ten Microsecond Delay Created on September Fourteenth, Two Thousand Twenty-Two

Tags: Bleichenbacher Timing Attack

This dataset contains features extracted from network traffic related to the Bleichenbacher timing attack. The attack is a type of side-channel attack that targets the RSA decryption process.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset includes attributes related to the Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect messages. These attributes describe various aspects of the TCP and TLS protocols, such as source and destination ports, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, window sizes, and flags.

The Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and various flags.

The TLS Alert attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and various flags, as well as the TLS record content type, length, alert message level, and description.

The TCP Disconnect attributes include the source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, and various flags.

The dataset also includes the message order of each type of message within the server responses.

Features:

* Label
* Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes

Vulnerable Classes:

* Incorrectly formatted PKCS#1 padding
* Correctly formatted PKCS#1 PMS message but one byte shorter
* No zero byte in message
* Wrong first byte (zero byte set to seventeen)
* Wrong second byte (two set to seventeen)

Keywords: Bleichenbacher timing attack, RSA decryption, side-channel attack, network traffic, TCP, TLS, PKCS#1 padding.
