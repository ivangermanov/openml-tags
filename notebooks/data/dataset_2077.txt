QSAR-TID-107 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred seven. 

Features 

MOLECULE CHEMBL ID
FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints 

Features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
