The Adult dataset is a collection of demographic data used for machine learning and myth-busting purposes. The prediction task is to determine whether an individual earns more than fifty thousand dollars per year.

This dataset is a derived version of the original UCI dataset, with some features discretized for easier analysis. The original dataset was extracted from the nineteen ninety-four Census database by applying certain conditions to ensure data cleanliness.

These conditions included selecting individuals who were older than sixteen years, had an Adjusted Gross Income greater than one hundred, and worked more than zero hours per week. The resulting dataset contains a diverse range of attributes, including age, work class, education level, marital status, occupation, and country of origin.

The Adult dataset is often used in studies to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms and models. Its relatively large size and diverse feature set make it an ideal choice for testing and comparing different approaches.
