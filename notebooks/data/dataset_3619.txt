Tags: Government, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11006. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous fingerprint features. These features do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target of this dataset is the Melanocortin Receptor five, also known as MC-five R or MC-five Receptor. It is a single protein and its preferred name is Melanocortin Receptor five. Its synonyms include MC-two, MC-five R, and Melanocortin Receptor five.

This receptor is a member of the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is classified under the group of peptide receptors. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and regulation of metabolic processes.
