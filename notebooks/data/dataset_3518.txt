The Prostanoid FP receptor is a single protein target, also known as the Prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and cell population proliferation. The receptor is activated by prostaglandin F2-alpha, which is a potent stimulator of uterine contraction and is involved in parturition.

The dataset contains information on various compounds that interact with the Prostanoid FP receptor, including Tafluprost, Dinoprostone, Latanoprostene Bunod, Travoprost, and Sepetaprost. These compounds are agonists of the receptor and have been approved for various indications, including glaucoma and obstetric uses.

The Prostanoid FP receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus, and is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation.
