This binarized version of the original dataset has been modified to convert the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by relabeling the majority class as positive, denoted by 'P', and all other classes as negative, denoted by 'N'. 

The dataset includes various features that describe different aspects of the tumor. These features include the patient's age, sex, and the histological type of the tumor. Additionally, the dataset provides information on the degree of differentiation of the tumor cells. It also includes details about the presence of the tumor in different parts of the body, such as the bones, bone marrow, lungs, pleura, peritoneum, liver, brain, skin, neck, supraclavicular area, axillary region, mediastinum, and abdomen.
