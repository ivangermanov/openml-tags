Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion allows for binary classification tasks to be performed on the data.

The dataset contains various features related to housing characteristics and market conditions. These features are used to predict the binary classification of houses into positive or negative categories based on their target values relative to the mean.

This binarized version of the dataset enables researchers and data scientists to explore classification algorithms and techniques in the context of housing data. It provides an opportunity to investigate the factors that contribute to a house being classified as positive or negative according to the defined threshold.

By utilizing this dataset, analysts can develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting housing classifications, potentially uncovering insights into the housing market and property valuation.
