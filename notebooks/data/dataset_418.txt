This dataset is part of a collection of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are generated using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.

The dataset focuses on quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and molecular descriptors influencing various properties of chemical compounds. It includes information on melting points, biological activity, toxicity, and biodegradability of different chemical structures.

The data encompasses a wide range of chemical compounds, including carbolenes, benzodiazepines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, anilines, phenols, halogenated aliphatic compounds, and antimycin analogues. These compounds are analyzed for their physicochemical properties, biological activities, and environmental impacts.

The studies utilize various computational and statistical methods to develop predictive models and explore structure-property relationships. These models aim to elucidate the influence of molecular descriptors on properties such as melting point, receptor binding, toxicity, and biodegradability.

The research applications span across medicinal chemistry, environmental science, and computational biology. The datasets provide valuable resources for developing and validating QSAR models, which can be applied in drug discovery, toxicology assessment, and environmental impact prediction.
