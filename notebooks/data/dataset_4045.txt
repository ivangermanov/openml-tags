Elevators 
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the classification on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in the same way as the other datasets in the tabular data benchmark. 

The Elevators dataset originates from the task of controlling an F sixteen aircraft, although the target variable and attributes are distinct from those found in the ailerons domain. The primary objective of this dataset is related to an action taken on the elevators of the aircraft.

Features include Climb Rate, Vertical Acceleration, Roll, Pitch, Current Roll, Absolute Roll, Differential Climb Rate, Differential Roll Rate, Differential Differential Climb Rate, System Activation Time One, System Activation Time Two, System Activation Time Three, System Activation Time Four, Differential System Activation Time One, Differential System Activation Time Three, and System Activation.

Keywords: Elevators, Aircraft Control, Machine Learning, Classification, Numerical Features.
