QSAR-TID-259 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cannabinoid CB2 receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cannabinoid CB2 receptor. The Cannabinoid CB2 receptor is a single protein, also known as Cannabinoid receptor two, CB two, CB-two, CB two A, CB two B, and other synonyms. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in the lipid-like ligand receptor family.

The receptor is found in Homo sapiens, and is classified as a one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including response to amphetamine, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and others.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cannabinoid CB2 receptor. The data is useful for understanding the relationship between the structure of compounds and their activity on the Cannabinoid CB2 receptor.
