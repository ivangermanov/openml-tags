**Water Bayesian Network. Sample 0.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which is a comprehensive collection of Bayesian networks. The Water Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium network that consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of ten thousand and eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, and the average degree is around four point one two. The maximum in-degree of the network is five.

The Water Bayesian Network is a complex system that models the relationships between various factors in a waste water treatment process. It is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in this field, as it provides a comprehensive and structured representation of the underlying mechanisms and dependencies.

The network features a range of variables related to the waste water treatment process, including chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels, as well as other relevant factors.

**Keywords:** Bayesian network, waste water treatment, chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, phosphorus.
