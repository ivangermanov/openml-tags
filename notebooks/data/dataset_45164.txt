This network consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

The Water Bayesian Network was designed to model the complex relationships between various factors influencing wastewater treatment. This network provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and predicting the behavior of wastewater treatment systems.

The Water Bayesian Network has been widely used in the field of environmental engineering and has been cited in numerous research papers.
