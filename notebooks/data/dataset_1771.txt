The QSAR-TID-20112 dataset, tagged as Economics and MTLQSAR, is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20112.

This dataset consists of two hundred forty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes various molecular fingerprints, such as FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four one, and so on.

The dataset is related to the dopamine D1 receptor, also known as D(1A) dopamine receptor, dopamine D1 receptor, or DRD1. This receptor is a single protein and belongs to the species group Sus scrofa. Its protein target classification is one point Membrane receptor slash Family A G protein-coupled receptor slash Small molecule receptor family A GPCR slash Monoamine receptor slash Dopamine receptor.

The dopamine D1 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, dopamine receptor signaling pathway, vasodilation, and adenylate cyclase-activating adrenergic receptor signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, dopamine D1 receptor, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, synaptic transmission.
