Elevators 
Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset is obtained from the task of controlling an F-16 aircraft, although the target variable and attributes are different from the ailerons domain. In this case, the goal variable is related to an action taken on the elevators of the aircraft. The dataset features a range of attributes, including climb rate, speed, pitch, yaw, current roll, absolute roll, and differences in climb rate and roll rate, as well as various time-related attributes. The ultimate goal is to predict the action taken on the elevators based on these numerical features.
