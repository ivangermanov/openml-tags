QSAR-TID-12755 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12755. The dataset has thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12755. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Dopamine D5 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as D(1B) dopamine receptor, D(5) dopamine receptor, and Drd5. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, response to amphetamine, and regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure.

The dataset provides information about the receptor's function, including its role in dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity, coupled via Gs, and its ability to bind to dopamine. The receptor is also involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, response to amphetamine, and regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure.
