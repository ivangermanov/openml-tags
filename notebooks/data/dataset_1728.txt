This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL2, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and other molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite this source when using the data.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL2 is a single protein that is also known as Abelson Murine Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2, Abelson-Related Gene Protein, and Abelson Tyrosine-Protein Kinase 2. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and tyrosine protein kinase Abl family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes including protein phosphorylation, cell communication, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. It also plays a role in regulating apoptosis, cell motility, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization.
