Name: Low Birth Weight Dataset
Tags: OpenML-Reg

This dataset focuses on identifying risk factors associated with giving birth to low birth weight babies (weighing less than grams). Data were collected on women, of which had low birth weight babies and had normal birth weight babies. Four key variables examined were age, weight of the subject at her last menstrual period, race, and the number of physician visits during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The data were collected at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, during. This dataset contains the complete data. Related paired and matched datasets are also available.

The dataset includes variables such as identification code, low birth weight indicator, mother's age, weight at last menstrual period, race, smoking status during pregnancy, history of premature labor, history of hypertension, presence of uterine irritability, number of physician visits during the first trimester, and birth weight in grams.

These data have been used as an example for fitting multiple logistic regression models. Low birth weight is a significant concern for physicians due to high infant mortality rates and birth defect rates associated with it. A woman's behavior during pregnancy, including diet, smoking habits, and prenatal care, can significantly impact the chances of carrying the baby to term and delivering a baby of normal birth weight.

The variables included in this dataset have been shown to be associated with low birth weight in obstetrical literature. The study aimed to determine if these variables were important in the population served by the medical center where the data were collected.
