Name: House Sixteen H Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset House Sixteen H with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. The function first samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. Next, it samples the columns uniformly if required, selecting a specified number of columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it stratifies the data and splits it into a subset using the train test split function from scikit learn. Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and columns.
