The QSAR-TID-101360 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101360. It has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically designed for studying the relationship between chemical structures and biological activities. The MetaQSAR project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for QSAR modeling, allowing researchers to explore the complex relationships between molecular structures and their corresponding bioactivities.

The dataset is particularly useful for understanding the role of Serine/threonine-protein kinase PFTAIRE-two, also known as Cyclin-dependent kinase fifteen, in various cellular processes. This enzyme plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, particularly during the G1/S transition phase.

The dataset includes information about the target protein, such as its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. Additionally, it provides access to related databases, including Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, IntAct, PharmGKB, and UniProt, allowing researchers to explore the protein's functions, interactions, and regulatory pathways.
