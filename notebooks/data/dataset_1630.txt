This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FES, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset focuses on Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FES, an enzyme involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and protein phosphorylation.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP molecular fingerprints, and median PXc50 values. The FCFP molecular fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor that encodes the structural information of molecules into a binary format. These fingerprints were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, a software tool for cheminformatics and bioinformatics analysis.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and virtual screening for Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FES inhibitors. By analyzing the relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding activities, researchers can identify potential leads and optimize their properties for improved efficacy and safety.
