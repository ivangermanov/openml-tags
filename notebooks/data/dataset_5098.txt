Bleichenbacher Timing Attack Dataset contains ten micro seconds delay data collected on Nineteen September Two Thousand Twenty-Two.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset consists of various attributes related to Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect messages.

Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags (reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN echo, urgent, acknowledgment, push, reset, syn, fin), window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options (nop, kind, length, timestamp, time delta), and message order.

TLS Alert attributes comprise source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags (reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN echo, urgent, acknowledgment, push, reset, syn, fin), window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options (nop, kind, length, timestamp, time delta), record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and message order.

TCP Disconnect attributes consist of source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags (reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN echo, urgent, acknowledgment, push, reset, syn, fin), window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options (nop, kind, length, timestamp, time delta), and message order.

The dataset also includes labels for vulnerable classes, which are incorrectly formatted PKCS one padding, correctly formatted PKCS one PMS message but one byte shorter, no zero in message, wrong first byte (zero set to seventeen), and wrong second byte (two set to seventeen).
