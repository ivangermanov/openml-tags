Dataset Information

The dataset is a predecessor to this dataset and its development, which is described in the references below. These references also provide results, although not cross-validated, for classification by a rule-based expert system with that version of the dataset.

The dataset does not have any missing values.

Additional Variable Information

The dataset contains the following variables:

Sequence Name, which is the accession number for the SWISS-PROT database
McGeoch's method for signal sequence recognition
Von Heijne's method for signal sequence recognition
Lip, which is von Heijne's Signal Peptidase II consensus sequence score, a binary attribute
Charge, which is the presence of charge on the N-terminus of predicted lipoproteins, a binary attribute
Amino Acid Content, which is the score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of outer membrane and periplasmic proteins
ALOM Membrane Spanning Region Prediction, which is the score of the ALOM program
ALOM Program After Excluding Putative Cleavable Signal Regions, which is the score of the ALOM program after excluding putative cleavable signal regions from the sequence

Class Labels

The class labels are as follows:

Cytoplasm
Inner Membrane Without Signal Sequence
Perisplasm
Inner Membrane Uncleavable Signal Sequence
Outer Membrane
Outer Membrane Lipoprotein
Inner Membrane Lipoprotein
Inner Membrane Cleavable Signal Sequence
