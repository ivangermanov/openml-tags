NFL Team Stats Dataset 

This dataset includes computer scraped information from ESPN's Team Stats webpage for every single game played between two thousand two and two thousand nineteen. The seasons comprise all two hundred fifty-six regular season games plus eleven playoff games, excluding three games that are missing from ESPN's website due to unknown reasons. It is important to note that any errors or irregularities present in ESPN's data will also be reflected in this dataset. 

For instance, red zone conversions are not available prior to the two thousand six-two thousand seven season. This dataset boasts an impressive range of features, including the date of the game, the teams playing away and at home, the number of first downs achieved by both teams, the number of third downs converted, fourth downs attempted, and many more.

These features provide detailed insights into various aspects of team performance, such as passing yards, rushing yards, total yards gained, completions, attempts, sacks, rushing attempts, fumbles, interceptions, turnovers, penalties, red zone efficiency, drives, defensive touchdowns, possession time, and scores.
