Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled oz one through oz fifty, along with a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, likely used for mythbusting and various studies. The original numeric target feature has been converted into a binary classification task by calculating the mean value and categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset consists of fifty input features, each labeled with the prefix "oz" followed by a number. These features likely represent various measurements or attributes relevant to the problem at hand. The final feature, labeled "binaryClass," serves as the target variable for classification tasks.

Researchers and data scientists may find this dataset useful for exploring binary classification techniques, comparing algorithm performance, or investigating the effects of binarizing continuous variables. The mythbusting and study tags suggest that this dataset might be employed in debunking common misconceptions or as part of broader research initiatives in machine learning and data analysis.
