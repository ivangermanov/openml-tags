QSAR-TID-10501 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10501. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Cannabinoid CB1 receptor.

The Cannabinoid CB1 receptor is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including pain perception, mood regulation, and memory. It is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by cannabinoids, such as THC, and is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including pain, mood, and memory. It is also implicated in various diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and obesity.
