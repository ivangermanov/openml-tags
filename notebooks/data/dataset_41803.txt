Tags: Chemistry, Finance, Forex, Forex Day, Forex High, Machine Learning

This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex EUR/CHF currency pair obtained from Dukascopy's Historical Data Feed.

Each instance represents a single daily candlestick, with the entire dataset spanning from January to December. As the Forex market is closed on weekends, these days are excluded from the dataset. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the direction of the mean high price of the following day based on the current day's prices. To achieve this, the class attribute is defined as follows: if the mean high price increases the following day, the class attribute is set to true; otherwise, it remains false.

Please note that this is a hypothetical task designed for scientific purposes only. In reality, trading strategies should be based on predictions made on close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
