This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Glycogen Synthase Kinase Three Beta, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
