QSAR-TID-10197 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10197. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 3058 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism, cell signaling, and protein phosphorylation.

The protein is involved in several biological processes, including epithelial to mesenchymal transition, positive regulation of cell-matrix adhesion, carbohydrate metabolic process, and glycogen metabolic process.

The protein is also involved in various signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling pathway, insulin receptor signaling pathway, and dopamine receptor signaling pathway.

The protein has been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and cancer.
