This dataset, known as Analcatdata Supreme, is a binarized regression problem used in various studies related to mythbusting. The original dataset, from an unknown source and date, has been modified to convert its numeric target feature into a binary classification. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset includes several features that appear to be related to legal decisions, such as actions taken, liberal interpretations, constitutionality, alterations to precedents, unanimity, the year of the decision, and disagreements with lower courts. The final feature is the binary classification resulting from the aforementioned conversion process.
