The Strikes dataset consists of annual observations on the level of strike volume, measured as days lost due to industrial disputes per one thousand wage and salary earners, along with their covariates in eighteen Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries from nineteen fifty-one to nineteen eighty-five.

The average level and variance of strike volume vary significantly across countries. Moreover, the data distribution exhibits a long right tail and features several large outliers.

Seven data fields comprise this dataset, including variables such as:

country codes,
year,
strike volume,
unemployment rates,
inflation levels,
parliamentary representation of social democratic and labor parties, and
a time-invariant measure of union centralization.

This dataset was analyzed in a forthcoming paper titled Vague Theory and Model Uncertainty in Macrosociology, which is set to appear in Sociological Methodology.

Permission has been granted to freely use and redistribute these data.
