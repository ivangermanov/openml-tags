The reason for creating the Goodreads Computer Books dataset is the requirement of a good, clean dataset of computer books. I had searched for datasets on books in Kaggle and found out that while most of the datasets had a good amount of books listed, there were either major columns missing or grossly unclean data. I mean, you can't determine how good a book is just from a few text reviews. Therefore, I collected this data from the Goodreads website from the Computer category to help people who are interested in this type of book.

Acknowledgements
This data was entirely scraped via the Webdriver.

Inspiration
The reason behind creating this dataset is pretty straightforward - I'm listing the books for all who need computer books, irrespective of the language and publication. So, go ahead and use it to your liking, find out what book you should be reading next, and all possible approaches to exploring this dataset are welcome.

Notes
The missing values are imputed in this data by the creator. The dataset features include Book Title, Ratings Count, Average Rating, Publication Year, Edition, Number of Pages, Book Language, and Reviews.
