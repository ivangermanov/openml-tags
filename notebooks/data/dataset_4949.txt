**Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample Eight.**

This Bayesian network repository reference is available online. It consists of thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, while the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium model that focuses on agriculture and culture. It explores the factors influencing mildew growth in winter wheat, providing valuable insights for farmers and agricultural experts.
