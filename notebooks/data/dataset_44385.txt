Sub sampling of the dataset Pol with a seed of three arguments number rows max equal to two thousand arguments number cols max equal to one hundred arguments number classes max equal to ten arguments no stratify equal to true generated with the following source code:

A function called sub sample takes in self, seed, number rows max, number cols max, number classes max, and stratified as parameters. This function uses numpy's default random generator to generate random numbers. It then selects a uniform sample of classes from the unique values in y. If the number of classes exceeds the maximum allowed, it selects the top classes based on their value counts. The indices where these classes are present are then selected from y.

The function then uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, it randomly selects column indices and sorts them. The selected columns are then used to subset x.

If the length of x exceeds the maximum allowed number of rows, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data. This is done using scikit learn's train test split function with stratification.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset object with the subsetted data.
