QSAR-TID-20036 Dataset 

Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three, Text and Literature 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen, also known as Collagenase Three, Matrix Metalloproteinase-Thirteen, MMP Thirteen, and MMP-Thirteen. It has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo pCI Fifty. 

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen is a single protein preferred name, also known as Collagenase Three, Matrix Metalloproteinase-Thirteen, MMP Thirteen, and MMP-Thirteen. It belongs to the species group of Bos Taurus and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M Ten A subfamily. 

It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, extracellular matrix disassembly, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, and bone morphogenesis. It is located in the extracellular region, extracellular space, and extracellular matrix. 

It has various molecular functions, including endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, collagen binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.
