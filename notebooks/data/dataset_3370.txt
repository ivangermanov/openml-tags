QSAR-TID-20036 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen. Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen is also known as Collagenase Three, and it belongs to the Metallo Protease MAM clan and Metallo Protease M ten A subfamily.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including proteolysis, extracellular matrix disassembly, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, and bone morphogenesis. It is involved in the breakdown of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, and it is also involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell migration, differentiation, and survival.
