This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This conversion enables the analysis of the data as a classification problem.

The dataset consists of various chemical and biological features, including properties related to molecules and their interactions. These features are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of chemical reactions and biological processes.

The classification task involves predicting whether an instance belongs to the Positive or Negative class based on its chemical and biological characteristics.
