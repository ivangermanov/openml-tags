Data Sets for Regression Models for Time Series Analysis 

The LA Pollution-Mortality Study dataset contains five hundred eight observations, recorded every six days, from 1970 to 1979. This weekly filtered data was processed using a low-pass filter, which removed frequencies above 0.1 cycles per day.

The dataset consists of mortality rates, weather conditions, and pollution levels. The mortality rates include total mortality, respiratory mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. The weather conditions consist of temperature and relative humidity readings. The pollution levels comprise carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons, ozone, and particulates measurements.
