This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero one three five nine, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. It is essential for researchers to cite this dataset properly when using it for their research purposes.

The drug target is Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Nek One, also known as Never In Mitosis A-Related Kinase One, NimA-Related Protein Kinase One, or Renal Carcinoma Antigen Ny-Ren-Fifty Five. It belongs to the protein family of enzymes, kinases, and protein kinases, specifically the other protein kinase group and the Nek family.

This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle, cell division, cilium assembly, phosphorylation, and protein phosphorylation. It is located in different components of the cell, such as centriolar satellites, centrosomes, cytoskeleton, cytosol, microtubule organizing centers, nucleoplasm, nucleus, and pericentriolar materials.
