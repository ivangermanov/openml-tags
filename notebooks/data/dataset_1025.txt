This dataset, known as Analcatdata German GSS, is associated with multiple study tags. It originates from an unknown source with an unspecified date. The data has been binarized from its original form, transforming a multi-class target feature into a binary classification problem. In this process, the majority class was designated as positive ('P'), while all other classes were grouped as negative ('N'). The dataset includes features such as political system, age of participants, time when the survey was conducted, educational background, geographical region, and a binary class indicator. This modified version of the dataset is intended for use in binary classification tasks and analysis.
