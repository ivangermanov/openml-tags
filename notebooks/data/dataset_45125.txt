**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Five**

This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete medium model.

The Barley Bayesian Network has forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters exceeding one hundred fourteen thousand. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, while the average degree is around three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

This preliminary model for barley was developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". The model focuses on various aspects of barley production, including characteristics, growth conditions, and environmental factors.

Some of the key characteristics included in the model are protein content, sort, and size. The model also takes into account agricultural practices, such as the use of pesticides, and environmental factors like soil type and nitrogen levels.
