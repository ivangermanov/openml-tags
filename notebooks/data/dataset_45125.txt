**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample 5.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a comprehensive resource for Bayesian network models. The Barley Bayesian Network is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides". This model features a complex network of variables related to barley production, including factors such as soil type, nitrogen levels, and protein content.

The network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of one hundred fourteen thousand and five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree of the network is four.

The Barley Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of agriculture and crop production. It provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex relationships between various factors affecting barley production, and can be used to inform decision-making and improve crop yields.
