Please cite: GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be used for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be utilized for estimating various quality metrics such as accuracy, precision, and area under ROC curve for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms. This repository was created in response to an increasing demand in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems. By providing a standardized set of problems, researchers can compare different classification and feature selection techniques on equal footing.

Origin of data: Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without intellectual property restrictions. This approach provides direct benefits to patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on several factors:
- Consistency in tissue sample processing procedures
- Uniform microarray platform used across all samples
- Availability of additional information for combined genotype phenotype studies
- Large number of samples available for various tumor types

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, please acknowledge the assistance received by using this repository. This will help others obtain the same datasets and replicate your experiments. You are also encouraged to acknowledge the contribution of the Expression Project for Oncology and the International Genomics Consortium for making their gene expression samples publicly available.

Features: The dataset includes numerous gene expression features, represented by probe set identifiers. These features correspond to various genes and genetic markers measured in the microarray experiments.
