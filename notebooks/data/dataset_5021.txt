**Link Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository and is classified under the categories of Machine Learning and Earth Science.

The Link Bayesian Network has a large number of nodes and arcs, indicating its complexity. It has an average Markov blanket size, which suggests that each node has a moderate number of neighbors. The network also has an average degree, implying that each node has a moderate number of connections.

This network was designed to model linkage analysis in large pedigrees with many loops. It uses blocking Gibbs sampling to efficiently explore the complex probability space.

Features of this network include various variables related to pedigree analysis, although some of these feature names may not be easily interpretable.
