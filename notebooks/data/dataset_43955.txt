This is the Poker dataset, retrieved from the LibSVM site. The dataset was created by joining the test and train datasets, relabeling classes, and normalizing each file column-wise. The normalization process involved setting constant features to zero, converting binary features to zero and one, and dividing multinary or real features by their standard deviation.

The dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark and is part of the tabular data benchmark. It is a transformed version of the original dataset, which is available on the LibSVM site.

Please note that the Poker dataset has a mild redundancy, with some duplicated data points, roughly point two percent, within each file, which have not been removed.

Features include various numerical columns.
