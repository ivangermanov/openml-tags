Sub sampling of the dataset Volkert with seed equal to zero arguments n rows max equal to two thousand arguments n cols max equal to one hundred arguments n classes max equal to ten arguments no stratify equals true generated with the following source code.

This function subsamples a dataset given certain parameters. It takes in a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether or not to stratify the sampling process. The function first uniformly samples classes, then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. Finally, it stratifies the data accordingly based on the target variable.

The resulting dataset has been transformed into a format suitable for further analysis. This includes converting categorical columns to string format for OpenML compatibility. The categorical mask has been preserved, and the column names have been updated to reflect the new selection.
