Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses random number generation to select a specified number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The function ensures that the subsample is stratified according to the target variable.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset. It does this by getting the unique classes in the target variable, and then randomly selecting the specified number of classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

Next, the function selects a specified number of columns from the subsampled dataset. It does this by randomly selecting the specified number of column indices and then using these indices to subset the columns of the dataset.

Finally, the function selects a specified number of rows from the subsampled dataset. It does this by using the train test split function from scikit learn, which ensures that the subsample is stratified according to the target variable.

The function returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original dataset.
