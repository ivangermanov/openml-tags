**Hailfinder Bayesian Network. Sample 7.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available at [URL](https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-large.html#hailfinder).

This network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, and the average degree is two point three six. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Hailfinder system is a Bayesian system for forecasting severe weather. It is a comprehensive model that takes into account various factors to predict the likelihood of hail.

The network features a range of variables, including cloud characteristics, atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and moisture levels. These variables are interconnected to provide a detailed understanding of the complex relationships between them.
