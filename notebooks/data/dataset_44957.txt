**Data Description**
The Airfoil Self Noise dataset, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel, comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments. The task is to predict the scaled self noise.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset consists of the following attributes: frequency, which represents the rate of oscillation in Hertz; angle of attack, which is the angle between the oncoming airflow and the airfoil, measured in degrees; chord length, which is the distance between the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil, measured in meters; free stream velocity, which is the speed of the oncoming airflow, measured in meters per second; displacement thickness, which is the distance between the surface of the airfoil and the point where the velocity is zero, measured in meters; and sound pressure, which is the target feature, measured in decibels.
