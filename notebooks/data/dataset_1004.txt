Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous columns representing various measurements or attributes. The specific column names are not provided in a human-readable format, but they range from column one through column sixty. The final feature is labeled as binary class.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the classification task has been simplified from multiple classes to a binary classification problem. The majority class has been designated as positive, while all other classes have been grouped together as negative. This transformation allows for easier analysis and modeling of the data in a binary classification context.

The dataset likely contains synthetic control data, which could be used for various analytical or machine learning purposes. The large number of features suggests that it may capture complex patterns or relationships within the data.
