Name: Subsample of the RL Dataset with Three Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the RL dataset with seed equal to three, maximum number of rows equal to two thousand, maximum number of columns equal to one hundred, maximum number of classes equal to ten, and stratification enabled

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset, and then selects the corresponding rows. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows.

The RL dataset is a large dataset with forty-four thousand one hundred sixty rows. The subsample function is used to reduce the size of the dataset while preserving its characteristics. The resulting dataset has two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratification option is enabled to ensure that the classes are represented proportionally in the subsample.

Features: The dataset contains various features, including V One, V Five, V Six, V Eight, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, V Twenty-Two, and the class label.
