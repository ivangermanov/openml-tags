Subsampling of the dataset RL with seed equals three, maximum number of rows two thousand, maximum number of columns one hundred, maximum number of classes ten, and stratification equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters self, seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset. 

First, it sets up a random number generator using the given seed. Then, it gets the feature matrix x and the target vector y from the given dataset. 

Next, it uniformly samples classes from the unique values in the target vector y. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects the maximum number of classes based on their frequency in the target vector. 

After selecting the classes, it gets the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to filter the feature matrix x and the target vector y. 

Then, it uniformly samples columns from the feature matrix x. If there are more columns than the maximum allowed, it selects the maximum number of columns randomly. 

If the resulting dataset has more rows than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to reduce the number of rows to the maximum allowed. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to strings and returns the resulting dataset along with its metadata.
