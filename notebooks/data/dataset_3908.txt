This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101188, is tagged with Government, MTLQSAR, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101188. There are eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, along with various FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset describes Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Three, also known as Germinal Center Kinase-Related Protein Kinase, GLK, MAP Four K Three, MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase Kinase Three, and MEK Kinase Kinase Three. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE twenty family/STE protein kinase KHS subfamily.
