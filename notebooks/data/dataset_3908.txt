QSAR-TID-101188 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Three, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September Two Thousand Fifteen. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Three.

The dataset is related to the protein target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Three, which is a single protein and has the preferred name Germinal Center Kinase-related Protein Kinase. It is also known as GLK, MAP4K3, MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase Kinase Three, and MEK Kinase Kinase Three.

The protein target is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and STE protein kinase, and is part of the STE protein kinase KHS subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, JNK cascade, response to UV, phosphorylation, response to tumor necrosis factor, and intracellular signal transduction.
