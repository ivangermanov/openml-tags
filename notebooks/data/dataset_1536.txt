This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand thirty-five, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was published in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited accordingly.

The drug target is a single protein, specifically serine threonine protein kinase two, also known as CTCL tumor antigen se twenty-nine, hSLK, KIAA zero two zero four, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species group of homo sapiens, and its protein target classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase STE protein kinase group STE protein kinase STE twenty family STE protein kinase SLK subfamily.

It is described as a STE twenty-like serine threonine protein kinase, and it has relationships with other proteins. Its expression atlas shows various components, functions, and processes. Specifically, it is involved in nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, identical protein binding, protein homodimerization activity, cadherin binding, and protein serine kinase activity.

Additionally, it participates in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, phosphorylation, regulation of cell migration, cytoplasmic microtubule organization, regulation of apoptotic process, protein autophosphorylation, and regulation of focal adhesion assembly.
