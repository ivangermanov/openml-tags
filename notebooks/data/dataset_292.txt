Machine Learning and Statistics 

This dataset is part of forty-one drug design datasets. These datasets were formed using Adriana Code software, which generated molecules and outputs from original studies. 

The mtp2 dataset was taken from the original study by Bergstrom, titled "Molecular Descriptors Influencing Melting Point and Their Role in Classification of Solid Drugs", published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science.

Other datasets were taken directly from their respective original studies. Each file has the target as its last attribute.

The original studies include Carbolenes, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat2, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama1, and Yokoyama2, which were published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.
