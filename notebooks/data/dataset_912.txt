This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The conversion process involved changing the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset consists of various features including Oz One, Oz Two, Oz Three, Oz Four, Oz Five, and Binary Class.
