Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with target values below the mean were classified as positive, denoted by 'P', while those above the mean were classified as negative, denoted by 'N'.

The dataset includes several features, labeled as oz one through oz five, along with a binary class feature. These features likely represent various measurements or attributes relevant to the problem domain, though their specific meanings are not provided in the given information.

This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for studies related to mythbusting and various other research purposes, as indicated by the associated tags. It offers researchers a simplified, two-class problem that can be used to test hypotheses, develop classification algorithms, or compare different analytical approaches.

When using this dataset, it is important to cite it properly and acknowledge its derivation from the original source. Researchers should also be aware of the transformation process used to create this binarized version, as it may impact the interpretation of results and the applicability of findings to the original problem domain.
