The Meta Album PanNuke Dataset is a semi-automatically generated segmentation and classification task of nuclei. This dataset contains images of nineteen different tissue types. Although this dataset was originally designed as a segmentation task, it has been transformed into a tissue classification task since the tissue type for each sample in the dataset is available. The images have been resized to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels and stain normalization has been applied to avoid bias and remove some spurious features.
