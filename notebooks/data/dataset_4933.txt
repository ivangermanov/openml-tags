Insurance Bayesian Network. Sample Three.

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository and can be found under the discrete-medium section.

The Insurance Bayesian Network consists of twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point nineteen, and the average degree is roughly three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network is a classic example of an adaptive probabilistic network with hidden variables, which was first introduced in the paper titled Adaptive Probabilistic Networks with Hidden Variables.

The Insurance Bayesian Network features various variables related to car insurance, including driving history, driving skill, age, ruggedness of the automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft devices, driving quality, risk aversion, good student discounts, other cars owned, make and model of the vehicle, accident history, socioeconomic status, home base, property cost, car value, antilock brakes, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft rates, airbags, medical costs, senior training, and cushioning.
