QSAR-TID-100426 Tags: Astronomy, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trace Amine Associated Receptor One, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprints of Compounds which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
