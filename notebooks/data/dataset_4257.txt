The Digital Images of Bacteria Species dataset, also known as DIBaS, is a collection of thirty-three bacterial species with approximately twenty images for each species. To create the Meta-Album, we decided to split each image into several smaller images before resizing them to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels. We then obtained a preprocessed dataset of over four thousand images with at least one hundred eight images for each class. This dataset was also preprocessed using blob normalization techniques, which is quite unusual for this type of image. The goal of this transformation was to reduce the importance of color in decision-making for a bias-aware challenge.
