Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with values below the mean are classified as positive, while those above or equal to the mean are classified as negative.

The dataset includes various features, though their specific names are not provided in a human-readable format. The binary classification feature is clearly defined as 'binaryClass', which represents the outcome of the aforementioned conversion process.

This binarized version of the dataset is likely intended for use in binary classification tasks, potentially in the context of machine learning or statistical analysis. The original source and date of creation for this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper citation and acknowledgment when using this resource in research or applications.
