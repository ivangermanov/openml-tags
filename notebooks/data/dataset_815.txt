The Autos dataset is classified under the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and more. This binarized version of the original dataset has undergone modifications to convert its multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. Specifically, the majority class has been relabeled as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all other classes have been relabeled as Negative, denoted by 'N'.

This dataset comprises various features, including vehicle characteristics such as make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, and physical dimensions like wheel base, length, width, and height. Additionally, it includes specifications related to the engine, such as engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, and peak RPM. Furthermore, the dataset also incorporates fuel efficiency metrics, namely city MPG and highway MPG, as well as the vehicle's price.
