The ChSCase Vine One dataset has been binarized into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean of the numeric target feature and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The resulting dataset contains nine features, although they are not easily interpretable due to their cryptic naming convention. The dataset is tagged with categories including Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and more.
