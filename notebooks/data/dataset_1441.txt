This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred eighty-seven, and it has eighty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred eighty-seven. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset has eighty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

Features include molecular ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is suitable for QSAR modeling and machine learning applications.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, FCFP, molecular fingerprints, drug target, ChEMBL.
