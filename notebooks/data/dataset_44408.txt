Name: Phoneme Seed One N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Phoneme with seed equal to one, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given arguments. If the number of classes is greater than nclasses max, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than ncols max, it selects a random subset of columns. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, it uses the train test split function from scikit learn to split the data into a subset of the given size, stratifying by the target variable. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subset of data, the categorical mask, and the column names.
