QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values of compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is Matrix metalloproteinase, also known as Collagenase, Matrix metalloproteinase, MMP, or MMP. It is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. The protein target classification is Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAM clan/Metallo protease MA subfamily.

Related targets include Collagenase, Matrix metalloproteinase ( and ), and MMP/MMP. Several small molecule compounds have been studied as Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, including CTS, doxycycline anhydrous, rebimastat, and apratastat. Some of these have reached clinical trial phases.

The protein is involved in various biological processes including endochondral ossification, growth plate cartilage development, proteolysis, extracellular matrix organization and disassembly, bone mineralization and morphogenesis, collagen catabolism, and response to amyloid beta. Its molecular functions include endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, collagen binding, peptidase activity, zinc ion binding, and hydrolase activity.

Additional information on this target can be found in resources like ExpressionAtlas, Gene Ontology, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, CGD, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
