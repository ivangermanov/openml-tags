The Cars dataset has been binarized, converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

This dataset was originally converted for ease of use. It contains various features including the car's name, miles per gallon, number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year.
