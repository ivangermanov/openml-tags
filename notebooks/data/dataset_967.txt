Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi class target feature is converted to a two class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: name, miles per gallon, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, binary class

This dataset contains information about various car models and their characteristics. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem. The majority class has been relabeled as positive, while all other classes are now considered negative. This transformation allows for binary analysis and modeling of the data. The features include various attributes of cars such as their fuel efficiency, engine specifications, and physical characteristics. Researchers and data scientists can use this dataset for mythbusting studies and various analytical purposes related to automotive engineering and classification tasks.
