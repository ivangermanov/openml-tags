Bach Choral Harmony 

Tags: **Music**, **Chords**, **Harmony**

The dataset is composed of sixty chorales by JS Bach, consisting of five thousand six hundred and sixty-five events. Each event of each chorale is labeled using one among one hundred and one chord labels and described through fourteen features.

The data was sourced from the University of California, Irvine.

The creators of this dataset are affiliated with the University of Turin.

This dataset was donated in May 2014.

The JS Bach Chorales were downloaded from the JSB Chorales website. Meter information was computed through the Meter program, which is part of the Melisma music analyzer. Chord labels were manually annotated by a human expert.

The dataset contains seventeen attributes:

* Choral ID corresponds to the file names from Bach Central.
* Event Number is the index of the event inside the chorale, starting from one.
* Pitch Classes are represented as yes or no, indicating whether a given pitch is present. Pitch classes are attributed as follows: C, C sharp/D flat, D, and so on up to B.
* Bass represents the pitch class of the bass note.
* Meter denotes the level of accentuation, ranging from one for less accented events to five for more accented events.
* Chord Label indicates the chord resonating during the given event.
