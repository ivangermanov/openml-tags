The QSAR-TID-11260 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11260. It consists of one hundred forty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains molecule ChEMBL ID and fingerprint features, namely FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four one, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four two, and so on.
