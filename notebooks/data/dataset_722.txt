Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled from f1 to f48, along with a binary class feature. The specific details of these features are not provided in the original text.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been transformed into a binary classification task. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the target variable and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean value. Instances with target values below the mean are classified as positive ('P'), while those above or equal to the mean are classified as negative ('N').

The dataset appears to be part of a larger study or series of studies, as indicated by the multiple study-related tags. It may be used for various purposes, including mythbusting and regression analysis. The binary classification approach allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem, potentially offering new insights or comparisons between regression and classification methods.

Researchers using this dataset should ensure proper citation and be aware of its derived nature from an original numeric dataset. The binary transformation may impact the interpretability and granularity of results compared to the original regression problem.
