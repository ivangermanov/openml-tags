QSAR-TID-100843 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase II Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase II Alpha. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on Casein Kinase II Alpha, a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.

The dataset contains multiple features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each compound, and MEDIAN PX50, which represents the activity value of each compound. The remaining features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds.

Casein Kinase II Alpha is a protein kinase that belongs to the CK2 family.
