QSAR-TID-12038 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12038, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints 

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12038. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset was scraped from various sources including MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains information about the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase nine enzyme, also known as Map three K nine, Mixed Lineage Kinase one, and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase nine. It belongs to the TKL protein kinase group and TKL protein kinase MLK family.

The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase nine enzyme plays a crucial role in various biological processes including the MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, phosphorylation, positive regulation of apoptotic process, and protein autophosphorylation. It has been linked to numerous diseases and disorders, and its inhibitors have been explored as potential therapeutic agents.
