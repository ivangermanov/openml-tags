Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi class target feature is converted to a two class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes labeled as "att" followed by numbers. The features are not human readable and have been omitted for clarity. The dataset includes over attributes in total.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original multi class classification problem that has been transformed into a binary classification task. The majority class was designated as the positive class, while all other classes were grouped together as the negative class. This binarization process allows for simplified analysis and modeling approaches suited for two class problems. The large number of attributes suggests this may be a high dimensional dataset, potentially derived from image or signal processing applications. Without more context on the original data source, it's difficult to determine the specific domain or intended use of these features.
