The MFEAT Factors dataset is a collection of data related to chemistry and life science. It was originally converted into a binarized version, where the multi-class target feature was transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by labeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

This dataset contains numerous features, including attributes one through ninety-six, which are essential for understanding the underlying relationships between various chemical compounds and their properties.

The MFEAT Factors dataset is an important resource for researchers and scientists working in the fields of chemistry and life science, providing valuable insights into the complex interactions between different molecules and their characteristics.
