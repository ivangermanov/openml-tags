This Diabetes Dataset 2019 was collected for research and non-commercial purposes only. The dataset consists of a total of instances with seventeen independent predictor variables and one binary target or dependent variable, which is diabetes.

The authors would like to acknowledge all the participants who contributed towards building this dataset. The inspiration behind creating this dataset was to build a machine learning algorithm to predict if a person has diabetes or not.

The dataset includes features such as age, gender, whether there is a family history of diabetes, whether the individual has high blood pressure, their level of physical activity, body mass index, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, sleep patterns, quality of sound sleep, regularity of taking medication, junk food habits, stress levels, blood pressure level, number of pregnancies, presence of polydipsia, urination frequency, and finally, whether the individual is diabetic or not.

Keywords: diabetes dataset, machine learning, classification methods, prediction model, health data, medical research.
