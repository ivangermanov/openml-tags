Life Science Dataset: QSAR-TID-12968
Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12968. It consists of 668 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four zero, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four one, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four two, and so on up to fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four nine hundred ninety-eight.
