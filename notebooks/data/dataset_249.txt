The BNG (lymph) dataset is an artificial dataset used for studying lymphatic system characteristics and abnormalities. It encompasses various features related to lymphatic function and structure, including lymphatic flow, node conditions, and structural changes. The dataset examines factors such as blockages in lymphatic vessels, bypass mechanisms, extravasation of fluids, and regeneration processes. It also considers early uptake patterns, changes in lymph node size (both diminished and enlarged), and various alterations in lymph node structure and function. Special forms of lymphatic abnormalities and dislocation of nodes are included as well. This comprehensive dataset aims to provide insights into the complex nature of lymphatic system disorders and their manifestations.
