Name: GNFUV PI Five
Tags: Agriculture, Medicine Test

Features:
Device: The unique identifier for the unmanned surface vehicle
Humidity: The measured level of moisture in the air
Temperature: The recorded air temperature reading
Experiment: A constant value indicating the specific experiment being conducted
Time: The timestamp when the reading was taken and reported

Scraped Data: Dataset Information
Additional Information 
The dataset comprises four sets of mobile sensor readings data, including humidity and temperature values, collected from a swarm of four unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Each USV set contains records in the format: USV Identification Number; Humidity Value; Temperature Value; Experiment Identification Number; Sensing Time.

The swarm of USVs is moving according to a predefined GPS trajectory, whose relative waypoints are specified in the accompanying documentation. The USVs are floating over the sea surface in a coastal area of Athens, Greece.
