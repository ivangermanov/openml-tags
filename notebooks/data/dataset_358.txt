Wind Dataset 

The wind dataset contains daily average wind speeds from 1961 to 1978 at twelve synoptic meteorological stations in the Republic of Ireland. This dataset was analyzed in great detail in an article titled Space Time Modeling with Long Memory Dependence Assessing Irelands Wind Power Resource.

Each line of the dataset corresponds to one day of data in the following format: year, month, day, average wind speed at each of the stations in a particular order. The stations are listed in a specific order as follows: Rosslare Harbour, Valentia Island, Roche's Point, Kilrush, Shannon Airport, Birr, Dublin Airport, Claremorris, Mullingar, Clarecastle, Belmullet, and Malin Head.

The data is presented in knots rather than meters per second. Users have been granted permission for unlimited distribution of this dataset. However, please report any anomalies found in the data to a specified email address.

It is essential to note that the dataset is quite large, consisting of over half a megabyte of data. Therefore, users should ensure they have sufficient storage space and processing power before requesting the data.
