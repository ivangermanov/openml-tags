QSAR-TID-101434 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101434. The dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor-interacting Serine/Threonine-protein Kinase Four, also known as Ankyrin Repeat Domain-containing Protein Three, DIK, PKC-delta-interacting Protein Kinase, and Receptor-interacting Serine/Threonine-protein Kinase Four. The target is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and TKL protein kinase group, specifically a TKL protein kinase RIPK family.

The target is found in the cytoplasm and membrane of Homo sapiens and is involved in various biological processes, including morphogenesis of an epithelium, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, and positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity. The target also has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, Receptor-interacting Serine/Threonine-protein Kinase Four, Ankyrin Repeat Domain-containing Protein Three, protein kinase, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings.
