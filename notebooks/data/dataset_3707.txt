**My Clash Royale Ladder Battles Dataset**

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset consists of my daily Clash Royale ladder battles, which I will be updating regularly. I invite you to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) or even train a machine learning model to predict whether I win or lose a battle.

In this dataset, "opponent" is abbreviated as "op". The features related to troops, buildings, spells, commons, rares, epics, and legendaries indicate the number of cards of each type used in a battle. Similarly, the level of each card is denoted by its name, with a value of zero indicating that the card was not used in the battle.

As a seasoned player, I only participate in one-versus-one ladder matches on my second Clash Royale account. I do not engage in two-versus-two matches.

Some notable features in this dataset include:

* Match outcome and score
* Trophies earned by both players
* Clan membership status
* Deck elixir cost
* Card types and levels used by both players
* Specific cards used by the opponent, including Tornado, Mortar, Goblin Gang, Freeze, Lightning, and many others
