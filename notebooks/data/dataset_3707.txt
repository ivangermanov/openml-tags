QSAR-TID-25 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Glucocorticoid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Glucocorticoid Receptor. The Glucocorticoid Receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as Glucocorticoid Receptor GRL NR3C1 Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1. It is a transcription factor, nuclear receptor, and nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset.

The Glucocorticoid Receptor is a nuclear receptor that is activated in response to glucocorticoids, which are a class of steroid hormones. It plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including metabolism, immune response, and development.

The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of compounds with activity values on the Glucocorticoid Receptor, which can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
