The ACS Income dataset is one of five datasets created as an improved alternative to the popular UCI Adult dataset. It was compiled from data obtained from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample. This dataset provides information for all fifty states and Puerto Rico. 

This upload represents the raw data from a specific year. The data consists of numerous rows, several features, and one target variable. Additionally, a column for the state code has been included for convenience. 

All columns are thoroughly described in the original publication, which provides detailed information about each feature. Furthermore, the PUMS Data Dictionary serves as another valuable resource that explains the characteristics of each column. 

For those interested in exploring this dataset further, additional details can be found online.
