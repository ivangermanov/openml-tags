The QSAR-TID-20154 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20154. This dataset has one thousand twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

The features in this dataset represent fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used for any purpose.

The drug target associated with this dataset is Dipeptidyl Peptidase IX, also known as Dipeptidyl Peptidase 9. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, and serine protease S9B subfamily.

This protein target is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, negative regulation of programmed cell death, and pyroptosis. It is also associated with various cellular components, including nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, microtubule, and cell leading edge.
