The YouTube Personality Dataset consists of a comprehensive collection of behavioral features, speech transcriptions, and personality impression scores for a diverse group of YouTube vloggers who explicitly showcase themselves in front of a webcam, engaging in conversations on a wide range of topics including personal issues, politics, movies, books, and more. This dataset has no restrictions on content, allowing for a natural and varied use of language.

The dataset includes an array of acoustic and linguistic features that capture various aspects of speech patterns and communication styles. These features encompass pitch, confidence, spectral entropy, amplitude peaks, energy, voiced segments, speaking rate, turn-taking, and vocal characteristics.

Additionally, the dataset provides information on personality traits, specifically extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness. Gender is also included as a demographic variable.
