The Boston house-price dataset contains information on various factors affecting housing prices in the Boston area. This dataset has been widely used in environmental economics and regression analysis studies. It includes variables such as per capita crime rate, proportion of residential land zoned for large lots, proportion of non-retail business acres, proximity to the Charles River, nitric oxides concentration, average number of rooms per dwelling, proportion of older housing units, distances to employment centers, accessibility to highways, property tax rates, pupil-teacher ratios, racial demographics, and socioeconomic status indicators.

The dataset is particularly notable for its use in examining the relationship between air quality and housing prices, as well as for demonstrating various regression diagnostic techniques. It has been featured in several academic publications and continues to be a valuable resource for researchers in urban economics, environmental studies, and statistical analysis.

The data is structured with multiple features, each representing different aspects of the Boston housing market and urban environment. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes, measured in thousands of dollars. This makes the dataset suitable for regression analysis and predictive modeling in real estate and urban planning contexts.

Researchers and data scientists often use this dataset to explore relationships between urban characteristics and housing values, to test statistical methods, and to develop predictive models for property valuation. Its enduring popularity in academic circles speaks to its richness and relevance in understanding urban dynamics and housing markets.
