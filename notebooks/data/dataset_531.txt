Boston House Price Data 

The Boston house price data is a renowned dataset that has been extensively utilized in various studies. This dataset was originally presented in Hedonic Prices and the Demand for Clean Air, an article written by experts in the field of environmental economics and management.

The dataset consists of thirteen variables, which are crucial in determining the median value of owner-occupied homes in suburban Boston. These variables include the per capita crime rate by town, the proportion of residential land zoned for large lots, the proportion of non-retail business acres per town, a Charles River dummy variable, nitric oxides concentration, the average number of rooms per dwelling, the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to a certain year, weighted distances to five Boston employment centers, an index of accessibility to radial highways, the full-value property tax rate, the pupil-teacher ratio by town, a variable related to the proportion of blacks by town, and the percentage of lower-status populations.

This dataset was later employed in Regression Diagnostics, a book published by experts in the field of statistics. In this book, the authors presented various transformations of the Boston house price data, which were discussed extensively in the chapter.
