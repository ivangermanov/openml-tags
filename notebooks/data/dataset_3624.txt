Machine Learning, Mathematics

Context: The Birdsong Recognition dataset captures information about bird recordings from France.

Acknowledgements: The creation of this dataset would not have been possible without the contributions of numerous individuals who have shared their recordings on Xeno-Canto.org, a comprehensive online repository of bird sounds.

Inspiration: This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore the fascinating world of bird songs. By analyzing the frequency of bird recordings in different regions, researchers can gain insights into species migration patterns, evolutionary changes, and the impact of environmental factors such as air pollution, which birds are often sensitive to and can serve as early indicators.

Features: Identification, Genus, Species, Subspecies, English Name, Recorder, Country, Location, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Recording Type, URL, File Name, Sonogram, License, Quality, Length, Time, Date, Upload Date, Additional Information, Remarks, Bird Seen, Playback Used.

Keywords: Birdsong Recognition, Machine Learning, Mathematics, Xeno-Canto, France, Environmental Monitoring, Species Migration, Evolutionary Biology.
