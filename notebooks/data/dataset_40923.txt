The Devanagari Script dataset is a collection of over ninety-two thousand images of forty-six characters from the Devanagari script. This script is an Indic script and forms the basis for over one hundred languages spoken in India and Nepal, including Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, and Maithili. It comprises forty-seven primary alphabets, fourteen vowels, and thirty-three consonants, and ten digits. In addition, the alphabets are modified when a vowel is added to a consonant. There is no capitalization of alphabets, unlike Latin languages.

The dataset includes images of the alphabet as well as numbers. Each image is thirty-two by thirty-two pixels in size.

The dataset is useful for character recognition tasks, particularly for the Devanagari script.
