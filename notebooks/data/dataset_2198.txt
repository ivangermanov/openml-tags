The QSAR-TID-10797 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor Two, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September Twenty-Fifteen. It should be cited when used.
