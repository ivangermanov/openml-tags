The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is a complex equation that includes sine, pi, and squared terms.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. Colinearity degree refers to the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values vary in terms of the number of features, which range from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. Similarly, the number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand.

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four. For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
