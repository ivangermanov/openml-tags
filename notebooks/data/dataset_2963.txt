Asteroid Dataset 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

The Asteroid Dataset consists of various features that describe asteroids. These features include the asteroid's full name, whether it is classified as potentially hazardous, its absolute magnitude, diameter, and albedo. The dataset also includes orbital elements such as eccentricity, semi-major axis, perihelion distance, inclination, longitude of the ascending node, argument of periapsis, and mean anomaly. Additionally, the dataset provides information on the asteroid's orbital uncertainty, including the standard deviations of its eccentricity, semi-major axis, perihelion distance, inclination, longitude of the ascending node, argument of periapsis, and mean anomaly. The class of the asteroid and its root-mean-square residual are also included.
