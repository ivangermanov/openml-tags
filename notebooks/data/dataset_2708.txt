**Data Description**
This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex EUR/PLN currency pair, sourced from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a single candlestick of one hour duration. The entire dataset spans a period from January first to December thirteenth, excluding weekends, as the Forex market is inactive during these days. The timestamp feature adheres to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent hour, relative to the mean high price of the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute assumes a value of true when the mean high price increases in the following hour, and false when the mean high price decreases or remains stagnant.

**Note** that this dataset serves a hypothetical purpose, intended solely for scientific investigation. Realistic trading strategies should focus on predicting close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
