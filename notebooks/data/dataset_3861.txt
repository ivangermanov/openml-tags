QSAR-TID-100850 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100850. The dataset has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100850. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the target protein, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The target protein is a brain-selective kinase two, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, and neuronal development.

The dataset also contains information on the expression of the target protein in different tissues and its subcellular localization. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is localized in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and centrosome.
