QSAR-TID-100850 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100850. It has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID.
