QSAR-TID-101299 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101299. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated protein kinase eight, also known as c-Jun N-terminal kinase one, Jnk one, Mapk eight, and Map kinase eight. The target is a single protein, and its preferred name is Mitogen-activated protein kinase eight. It is an enzyme, a kinase, and a protein kinase, belonging to the CMGC protein kinase group, CMGC protein kinase MAPK family, and CMGC protein kinase JNK subfamily.

The target is involved in various biological processes, including ossification, neuron migration, positive regulation of neuroblast proliferation, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, response to oxidative stress, JNK cascade, JUN phosphorylation, response to UV, response to mechanical stimulus, regulation of gene expression, positive regulation of gene expression, and positive regulation of cardiac muscle cell apoptotic process.

The target is also involved in various cellular components, including podosome, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, cytosol, axon, vesicle, dendrite cytoplasm, neuron projection, perikaryon, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, synapse, and basal dendrite.
