Earthquakes Data NZ 
Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

New Zealand lies on a fault line that runs through its spine, known as the Alpine Fault, which is very active and forms a part of the Ring of Fire. 

This is a comprehensive list of all the earthquakes that occurred in New Zealand during a specific time period.

Thanks to GeoNet for making the data freely available to users.

Inspiration 
As a resident of New Zealand, I frequently experience these earthquakes. Since the earthquake data is made available to the general public for free, and being a beginner in data analysis and machine learning, I was curious to explore whether I could learn something valuable from this data.

Features: origin time, longitude, latitude, depth, magnitude
