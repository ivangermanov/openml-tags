Earthquakes Data NZ
Tags: Context New Zealand

New Zealand lies on a fault line that runs through its spine, known as the Alpine Fault, which is very active and forms a part of the Ring of Fire. This unique geographical location makes it prone to earthquakes, which can be a frequent occurrence for its residents.

This dataset is a comprehensive list of all the earthquakes that occurred in New Zealand between a specific time period. The data provides valuable insights into the frequency, location, and intensity of these seismic events.
