This dataset is also obtained from the task of controlling the elevators of an F sixteen aircraft, although the target variable and attributes are different from the elevators domain. The target variable here is a variation instead of an absolute value, and there was some pre selection of the attributes. This dataset is part of a broader effort to improve the control systems of modern aircraft, where machine learning techniques can play a crucial role in optimizing performance and safety.

Features: Climb Rate, Altitude, Roll Rate, Current Roll
