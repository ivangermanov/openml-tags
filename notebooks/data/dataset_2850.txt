The data does not distinguish between timeout, memory out, or crashes. The status file will only contain "ok" or "timeout". If features are unknown, the instance was solved during feature computation. Although there is no necessary alignment and dependencies between the feature processing steps, the steps were executed in a fixed order. Therefore, all feature steps depend on the previously executed ones.
