USBreweries Tags: Context

While brainstorming ideas for a statistics project for a course last semester, the idea of utilizing data about microbreweries came up. Unfortunately, after some exploration and thought, we scrapped the idea, but I've got this data to show for it anyway.

Content
The data was acquired from the Beer Month Club website and contains information about breweries available on the site as of a certain date. The data includes information such as the name of the brewery, type of brewery, address, website, and state, among other things.

Code used to scrape the data is available online.

Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Beer Month Club for allowing the brew pub section to be scraped.

Inspiration
This data alone isn't too inspiring, but maybe it could be used as the basis for an analysis project that looks into information such as Yelp reviews or the number of links to a brewery's website.

Features: brewery name, type, address, website, state, and state breweries

Keywords: microbreweries, statistics project, data analysis, brewery information, Beer Month Club.
