Name: Eye Movements Seed Four N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset after performing uniform sampling on classes, columns, and rows.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the unique classes present in the dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset.

Next, it selects the indices where one of the selected classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly. Then, it uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns.

After that, it checks if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows. If so, it performs stratified sampling on the dataset to ensure that the class distribution is maintained.

Finally, it returns a dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
