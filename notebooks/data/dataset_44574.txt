Name: Arcene Seed One Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Arcene dataset with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

This dataset is a subsample of the original Arcene dataset, which has been reduced in size to facilitate faster processing and analysis. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows. The resulting dataset has a smaller number of classes, columns, and rows, making it more manageable for machine learning algorithms.

The subsampling process was performed using a random number generator with a seed value of one, ensuring reproducibility of the results. The maximum number of rows was set to two thousand, the maximum number of columns was set to one hundred, and the maximum number of classes was set to ten. The stratify argument was set to false, indicating that the sampling was not stratified.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, which are not human-readable. The dataset is suitable for machine learning algorithms that can handle high-dimensional data.
