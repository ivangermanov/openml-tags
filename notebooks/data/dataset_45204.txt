Win95pts Bayesian Network. Sample 7.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-large.html#hepar2

This Bayesian network consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. It has a total of nodes, which are connected by arcs. The network has a large number of parameters, which are used to define the relationships between the nodes. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, indicating that each node is influenced by a limited number of other nodes. The average degree of the nodes is moderate, suggesting that the network has a mix of nodes with few and many connections. The maximum in-degree of the nodes is relatively high, indicating that some nodes are heavily influenced by other nodes.

The network features a range of variables related to printing and computer systems, including printer ports, network printing, printer data, and desktop printing speed. It also includes variables related to problem diagnosis, such as problem four and problem six. Other variables include printer status, paper orientation, and available virtual memory.

Keywords: Bayesian network, printing, computer systems, problem diagnosis, printer status.
