Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

The dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was accomplished by calculating the mean value of the original target feature and using that as a threshold. Instances falling below this threshold were classified as positive, while those above were classified as negative.

This binarization process transforms the problem from a regression task to a binary classification task, which can be useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning algorithms. The resulting binary class is included as a feature named "binaryClass" in the dataset.

The original source and date of this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper data provenance and documentation in research and data science projects.
