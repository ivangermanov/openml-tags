The Hip Dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. This conversion involves taking the numeric target feature and transforming it into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean of the target values is calculated, and then all instances with a lower target value are classified as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all others are classified as Negative, denoted by 'N'. 

This dataset contains several features, including Control One, Control Two, Control Three, Control Four, Treatment One, Treatment Two, and Treatment Three, which are used to classify instances into either Positive or Negative categories.
