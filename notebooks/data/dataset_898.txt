Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Control, Treatment, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Hip, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified two-class classification problem. The process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean were labeled as positive, while those above were designated as negative. This transformation allows for easier analysis and application of binary classification algorithms.

The dataset includes various control and treatment features, along with the newly created binary class feature. It is particularly useful for studies related to mythbusting and comparative analysis. Researchers should note that this is a modified version of an earlier dataset and should cite it accordingly when used in academic or professional work.

The origin and exact date of creation for this dataset are currently unknown, highlighting the importance of proper documentation and attribution in data science projects. Despite this limitation, the dataset remains a valuable resource for those studying binary classification problems or conducting comparative analyses between different treatments and control groups.
