Subsampling of the dataset Riccardo with seed equals one, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals True.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratified argument determines whether the sampling should be stratified or not.

The function uses the train test split function from scikit learn to split the data into a subset and the rest. The subset is then returned as a new dataset.
