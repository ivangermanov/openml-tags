Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset contains all the articles published by the National Broadcasting Organization as of the first day of the year two thousand ten. The data is obtained by web scraping the National Broadcasting Organization website. The National Broadcasting Organization is one of the largest online news organizations in the Netherlands.

Features:

Date and Time of Publication: The date and time when the article was published.

Title: The headline of the news article.

Content: The body of the news article.

Category: The classification under which the National Broadcasting Organization filed the article.

URL: A link to the original article on the National Broadcasting Organization website.

About the Data:

The title and content features have been cleaned up to some extent. This means that extra white spaces and new lines have been removed. Furthermore, these features have been normalized for better readability.

It is worth noting that the National Broadcasting Organization also publishes live blogs, but the individual posts within these live blogs are not included in this dataset.

Example Usage:

I utilized this dataset in a recent blog post where I explored its potential applications.
