The Artificial Characters dataset is a collection of artificially generated data that describes the structure of capital letters. Specifically, it focuses on the letters A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, P, and R. Each letter's structure is broken down into a set of segments, resembling how an automatic program would segment an image. There are six hundred descriptions for each letter.

Originally, each instance of a letter was stored in a separate file, containing between one and seven segments, numbered zero through six. These files have since been merged, resulting in a single dataset. The first five instances describe the first five segments of the first segmentation of the first letter, followed by another seven instances describing another segmentation of the same letter, and so on.

The dataset contains several attributes that provide information about each segment. The object number indicates the number of the segment, ranging from zero to seven. The initial and final coordinates of a segment in a Cartesian plane are also included, represented by four variables: XX1, YY1, XX2, and YY2. Additionally, the size of each segment is calculated using the geometric distance between two points, A and B. Finally, the diagonal attribute represents the length of the diagonal of the smallest rectangle enclosing the character's picture, which remains constant across all objects.

This dataset has been used in various research studies, including those focused on learning fuzzy concept definitions and learning quantitative features in symbolic environments.
