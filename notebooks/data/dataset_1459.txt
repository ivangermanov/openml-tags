This database has been artificially generated. It describes the structure of capital letters A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, P, R, indicated by numbers in that order. Each letter's structure is described by a set of segments (lines) which resemble the way an automatic program would segment an image. The dataset consists of numerous such descriptions per letter.

Originally, each 'instance' (letter) was stored in a separate file, each consisting of between one and seven segments, numbered sequentially. Here they are merged. That means that the first several instances describe the first segments of the first segmentation of the first letter (A). Additionally, the training set and test set are merged. The subsequent instances describe another segmentation (also of the letter A) and so on.

Attribute Information:
- Object number: the number of the segment
- Initial and final coordinates of a segment in a Cartesian plane
- Size: the length of a segment computed by using the geometric distance between two points
- Diagonal: the length of the diagonal of the smallest rectangle which includes the picture of the character. The value of this attribute is the same in each object.
