MiniBooNE 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is part of the regression on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in the same way as the other datasets in this benchmark. 

The MiniBooNE dataset is originally from the MiniBooNE experiment, which aims to distinguish electron neutrinos, also known as signals, from muon neutrinos, referred to as backgrounds. The dataset is ordered, meaning it starts with all signal observations followed by background observations. 

The primary goal of this dataset is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying these two types of neutrinos based on their characteristics. 

Features of this dataset include various particle identification variables.
