MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-10967

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10967. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

Casein Kinase I Epsilon is a single protein, also known as CKI Epsilon or CKI-Epsilon, and is a part of the CSNK1E species group. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group and is classified under the CK1 protein kinase family.

Casein Kinase I Epsilon is involved in various biological processes, including DNA repair, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and protein localization. It also plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms, Wnt signaling pathways, and protein binding.

The dataset contains information about the protein structure, function, and interactions, including its mechanism of action, maximum phase, and first approval. It also includes references to various databases, such as ChEMBL, Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, and UniProt.
