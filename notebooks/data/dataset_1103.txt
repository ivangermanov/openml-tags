**Adult Dataset**

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset originates from the LIBSVM data repository. Please cite the original source.

The Adult dataset has undergone preprocessing to convert its fourteen original features into a more suitable format. Six of these features were continuous, while eight were categorical. To process the continuous features, they were discretized into quantiles, with each quantile being represented by a binary feature. Meanwhile, categorical features with multiple categories were transformed into multiple binary features, one for each category.

Details about the conversion process for each feature can be found in the files available at the original source.

The resulting dataset consists of numerous binary features, which are not explicitly named due to their technical nature.
