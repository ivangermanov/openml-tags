Physiochemical Protein Dataset 

This dataset contains physicochemical properties of protein tertiary structures, sourced from CASP 5-9. It comprises 45,730 decoys, ranging in size from zero to twenty-one angstroms. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the size of residues in a tertiary protein structure, which refers to a three-dimensional protein structure. When linked in a protein chain, an individual amino acid is referred to as a residue.

The dataset includes ten attributes, each describing distinct aspects of protein structures. 

Root Mean Square Deviation, or RMSD, represents the size of the residue. 
Total Surface Area is denoted by F One. 
Non-Polar Exposed Area is represented by F Two.
Fractional Area of Exposed Non-Polar Residue is denoted by F Three.
Fractional Area of Exposed Non-Polar Part of Residue is represented by F Four.
Molecular Mass Weighted Exposed Area is denoted by F Five.
Average Deviation from Standard Exposed Area of Residue is represented by F Six.
Euclidean Distance is denoted by F Seven.
Secondary Structure Penalty is represented by F Eight.
Spatial Distribution Constraints, characterized by N and K values, are denoted by F Nine.

This dataset does not contain any missing values.

Keywords: protein tertiary structures, physicochemical properties, residue size prediction, root mean square deviation, spatial distribution constraints.
