**Data Description**

This is the historical price data of the Forex Australian Dollar/New Zealand Dollar pair from Dukascopy. One instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and does not include weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends.

The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam. The class attribute is the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following minute, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. This means the class attribute is True when the mean High price is increasing in the following minute, and the class attribute is False when the mean High price is decreasing or remains the same in the following minute.

**Note** that this is a hypothetical task, intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trade strategies can only be applied to predictions on Close attributes, which are also available.
