 Porto Seguro Dataset 

Tags: Demographics, Geography 

The training dataset is derived from the Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction challenge hosted on Kaggle. The primary objective of this challenge is to predict whether a driver will file an insurance claim in the next year. As per the official rules of the challenge, the data can be utilized for academic research and education, as well as other non-commercial purposes.

For a comprehensive understanding of all variables, please refer to the Kaggle dataset repository. It is essential to note that numeric features with integer values that do not contain 'bin' or 'cat' in their variable names are, in fact, ordinal features that can be treated as ordinal factors in R.

Additionally, for further insights into effective preprocessing and feature engineering, please explore the Kernels section of the Kaggle challenge website. In this version, we have removed all 'calc' variables, as indicated by the Kaggle forum, since they do not carry significant information.

Features include ID, Target, PS Indicators, PS Regions, and PS Cars, among others.
