This project displays used cars from many different brands available for purchase. I created a data frame for the cars, each with nine features, and the prediction goal is to determine the car's price. I chose used cars for this project to utilize machine learning in predicting prices based on their characteristics. Assigning a fair price to a used car is a significant challenge, considering the various factors that affect its value after usage.

To address this issue, I collected as many relevant features as possible to provide a solid foundation for the machine learning algorithm to allocate an optimal price for each car. The type of modeling that suits my data is a supervised model since it includes a labeled output, 'car price', and utilizes regression analysis because the target output is a numerical value.

Additionally, this dataset can also be utilized for building a recommender system. The features considered include the car's name, brand, year of manufacture, maximum and minimum mileage in kilometers, type, city of ownership, condition, motor type, color, and price.
