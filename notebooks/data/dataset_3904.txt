QSAR-TID-30012 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FRK, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FRK. The data has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FRK is a single protein preferred name, also known as FRK, FYN-related kinase, Nuclear tyrosine protein kinase, RAK, and Protein-tyrosine kinase five. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase Src family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.

The protein target classification is enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase Src family. The description of the protein target is Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FRK.

The dataset contains information about the protein target, including its synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. It also contains information about the compounds, including their mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval.

The protein target is involved in several biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, phosphorylation, cell differentiation, and innate immune response.
