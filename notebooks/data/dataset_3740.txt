QSAR-TID-18025 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 18025. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, which aimed to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. It includes a collection of datasets, each containing QSAR data for a specific drug target.

The features in this dataset were generated using molecular fingerprints, which are a way to represent molecular structures as binary vectors. This allows for efficient comparison and analysis of molecular structures.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. However, the resulting features may be difficult to interpret due to their binary nature.

The dataset also includes information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, and classification. The target is a single protein, specifically an enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about the organism, species group, and protein target classification. It also includes gene ontology annotations, including component, function, and process annotations.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, drug target, enzyme, protease, serine protease, gene ontology annotations.
