QSAR-TID-18025 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin II, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 features.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin II. Trypsin II is a single protein, also known as Anionic Trypsin Two, Anionic Trypsin, Pretrypsinogen Two, Prss Two, Serine Protease Two. It belongs to the species Rattus norvegicus and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, serine protease PA clan, serine protease S One A subfamily.

Trypsin II is involved in multiple biological processes, including proteolysis, response to nutrient, digestion, and collagen catabolic process. It is also involved in multiple cellular components, including extracellular region and extracellular space. Trypsin II has multiple molecular functions, including serine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.
