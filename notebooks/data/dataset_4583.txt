Subsampling of the dataset PC Four with Seed Three 

This dataset is a subsampled version of PC Four, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a specified number of classes to include in the subsampled dataset. 

The dataset was then further reduced by uniformly sampling columns, selecting a specified number of columns to retain. Finally, the dataset was reduced to a specified maximum number of rows, while maintaining the class balance through stratification.

This subsampled dataset is part of the Life Science and Medicine domain, and includes a range of features related to software metrics and complexity measures. These features include measures of code length, complexity, and maintainability, among others.
