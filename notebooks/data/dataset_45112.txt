Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample Three.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a total of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred and nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, and the average degree is approximately two point four nine. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Alarm Monitoring System is a case study that demonstrates the application of two probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks.
