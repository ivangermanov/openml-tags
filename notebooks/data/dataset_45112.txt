The Alarm Bayesian Network is a prominent sample dataset in the field of machine learning and life science. This network repository reference is listed under the discrete medium category and provides a comprehensive structure for probabilistic inference techniques.

The Alarm Bayesian Network consists of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, which form a complex web of relationships between variables. With five hundred nine parameters, this network offers a rich source of data for analysis and modeling. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, indicating the level of interconnectedness among nodes. Meanwhile, the average degree of two point four nine suggests a moderate level of node connectivity, with some nodes having a maximum in-degree of four.

This dataset has been widely cited in academic literature, particularly in the context of probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. It serves as an exemplary case study for demonstrating the application of Bayesian networks in real-world scenarios.

Features of this dataset include various medical concepts, such as patient history, blood pressure, heart rate, and ventilation settings, among others.
