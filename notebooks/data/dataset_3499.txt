QSAR-TID-101397 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101397. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101397. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Lysophosphatidic acid receptor four, which is a single protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The Lysophosphatidic acid receptor four is a membrane receptor that is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of Rho protein signal transduction. It is also involved in the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration involved in phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled signaling pathway.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Lysophosphatidic acid receptor four. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data that can be used to develop predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.
