QSAR-TID-100931 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100931. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase NLK, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as Nemo-like Kinase NLK or Protein LAK one. It belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and is involved in various biological processes, including the MAPK cascade, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, and protein phosphorylation.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and cytosol, and is involved in various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, protein kinase activity, and protein serine/threonine kinase activity.
