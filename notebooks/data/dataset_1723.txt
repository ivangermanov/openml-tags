QSAR-TID-216 Dataset: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 216, with five hundred twenty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and fingerprint features.

Scraped Data:

The alpha-two b adrenergic receptor is a single protein, also known as ADRA two b, ADRA two l one, ADRA two r l one, alpha-two adrenergic receptor subtype c two, and alpha-two b adrenergic receptor. It is located in the plasma membrane and cytosol of Homo sapiens species group.

This receptor is classified as a one membrane receptor, family a g protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, monoamine receptor, and adrenergic receptor.

The receptor has relationships with other proteins, including adrenergic receptor alpha-two, adrenergic receptor alpha, and adrenergic receptor.

Gene Ontology Components include cytosol, plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle.

Gene Ontology Functions include g protein-coupled receptor activity, adrenergic receptor activity, alpha-two-adrenergic receptor activity, protein binding, and epinephrine binding.

Gene Ontology Processes include mapk cascade, angiogenesis, regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle contraction, regulation of smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and many others.
