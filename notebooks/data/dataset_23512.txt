Higgs Dataset

This dataset is related to the Higgs Boson detection data, which has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The data consists of twenty-eight features, divided into two categories: low-level features and high-level features. The low-level features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator, while the high-level features are functions of the low-level features, derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes.

The first column of the dataset is the class label, where one represents signal and zero represents background. The remaining twenty-seven features are a combination of low-level and high-level features. The low-level features include properties such as lepton momentum, lepton direction, missing energy magnitude, and jet properties. The high-level features are more abstract and include quantities such as the mass of jets, the mass of leptons and jets, and the mass of bottom quarks and W bosons.

There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such high-level features. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, with the last five hundred thousand examples used as the test set.

Attribute Information:
