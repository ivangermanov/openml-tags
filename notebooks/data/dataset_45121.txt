**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample One.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, specifically listed under the discrete-medium category. The network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters exceeding one hundred fourteen thousand. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree of the network is four.

The preliminary model for barley was developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides". This project aimed to create a comprehensive model for barley production, taking into account various factors that influence the process.

The network features a range of variables, including Thousand Kernel Volume, Thousand Kernel Weight, and Alpha Amylase, among others. These variables are crucial in understanding the complex relationships within the barley production process.
