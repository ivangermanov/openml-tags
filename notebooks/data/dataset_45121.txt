**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample One.**

This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete medium model.

The Barley Bayesian Network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of one hundred fourteen thousand and five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, while the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

This preliminary model was developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". It focuses on various aspects of barley production, including characteristics, growth conditions, and environmental factors.

Some notable features of this model include protein content, sorting characteristics, and growth attributes. The model also takes into account factors such as soil type, nitrogen levels, and pesticide usage.
