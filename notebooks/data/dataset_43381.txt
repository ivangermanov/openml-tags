Context

This dataset was generated during a hackathon for a project that aims to help new learners find the right course to learn by answering a few questions. It is an intelligent course recommendation system. To achieve this, data was scraped from a few educational websites, including Coursera's official website.

The project's goal is to assist learners in finding the perfect course by providing personalized recommendations. To make this possible, data was collected from various online learning platforms. This dataset contains information scraped from Coursera's website.

For more information about the project, visit the GitHub repository. The scraping code is also available on GitHub. An article about the dataset generation process can be found on Medium.
