**Coursera Course Dataset**
Tags: **Computer Systems**, **Machine Learning**

This dataset was generated during a hackathon for project purposes. We scraped data from Coursera's official website for our project, which aims to develop an intelligent course recommendation system. This system helps new learners find the right course to take by simply answering a few questions.

To achieve this goal, we needed to scrape data from various educational websites, including Coursera. This dataset is the result of our efforts and contains information about eight hundred ninety courses.

The dataset consists of six columns, each containing valuable information about the courses:

* **Course Title**: Contains the title of each course.
* **Course Organization**: Indicates which organization is offering the course.
* **Certificate Type**: Provides details about the types of certificates available upon completion of the course.
* **Course Rating**: Displays the ratings associated with each course.
* **Course Difficulty**: Indicates the level of difficulty or complexity of the course.
* **Students Enrolled**: Shows the number of students currently enrolled in the course.

This dataset is part of my initial endeavors in data science, and I hope it proves useful for others working on similar projects.
