KDD98
Tags: Dataset

The KDD98 Challenge is a dataset aimed at estimating the return on investment from direct mailings to maximize donation profits. This dataset represents a classic problem of binary classification, where the goal is to predict whether there will be a response to the mailing.

To improve the usability of the data, certain modifications have been made. Specifically, the features H Phone D, M Huc Two, Income, Wealth One, and Wealth Two were recoded as nominal factor variables. Additionally, the constant feature R F A Two R was removed from the dataset.

To address the issue of class imbalance, the majority class was downsized to forty percent of its original size. Furthermore, unused factor levels were dropped to simplify the data.

Some notable features of this dataset include Acceptor Category One, Acceptor Category Two, Acceptance Date Ten, Acceptance Date Eleven, and so on. Other important features encompass Age, Average Gift, Bible, Boats, Card Gift, and many others.
