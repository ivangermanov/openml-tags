Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning Context

With the growing dependence of our society on the internet, the amount of data that traverses networks continues to increase exponentially. Network monitoring and analysis of consumption behavior represent a crucial aspect for network operators, enabling them to obtain vital information about consumption trends in order to offer novel data plans tailored to specific users and gain an adequate perspective of the network.

Over-the-top (OTT) media and communication services and applications are revolutionizing internet consumption by generating a substantial amount of traffic across various available networks. OTT refers to applications that deliver audio, video, and other media over the internet, leveraging the infrastructure deployed by network operators, but without their involvement in the control or distribution of the content, and are notorious for their extensive consumption of network resources.

This dataset presents a comprehensive summarization of the consumption behavior of users within the Universidad del Cauca Network across different days of April, May, and June 2019. The users are categorized into three distinct groups: Low, Medium, and High Consumption users.
