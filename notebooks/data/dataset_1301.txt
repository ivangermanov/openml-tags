The QSAR-TID-101124 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101124. It has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features: molecule Chembl ID and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints of molecular structures, which were generated from smiles strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The molecule Chembl ID is an identifier for each compound, while the median pxc fifty represents the activity value of each compound on the drug target. The remaining features are fingerprints of molecular structures, which describe the chemical properties of each compound.

Fingerprints are commonly used in cheminformatics to compare and analyze molecular structures. They are particularly useful in QSAR modeling, where they serve as inputs to machine learning algorithms that predict the biological activity of compounds.

In this dataset, the fingerprints were generated using the pipeline pilot program, a software tool commonly used in cheminformatics. The program takes smiles strings as input and generates fingerprints based on the molecular structure.

The MetaQSAR project aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is an initiative to facilitate the development of QSAR models and improve our understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity.
