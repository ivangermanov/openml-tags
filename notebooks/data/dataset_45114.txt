Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample 5.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

The Alarm dataset is a discrete-medium Bayesian network consisting of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred and nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, and the average degree is approximately two point four nine. The maximum in-degree is four.

This dataset is a case study with two probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks.

The Alarm Monitoring System is a comprehensive system that includes various features such as patient history, anesthetic agents, and ventilator settings. These features are crucial in monitoring patients and making informed decisions.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with Bayesian networks and probabilistic inference techniques.
