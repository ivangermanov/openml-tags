This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes several features, including Low Birth Weight, Age, Weight, Race, Smoking Habit, Previous Premature Labor, Hypertension, Uterine Irritability, and First Trimester Vaginal Bleeding, which are classified into a binary class.
