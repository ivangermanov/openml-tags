This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive resource for QSAR models and data. It provides a valuable tool for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The data includes information about a specific protein target, known as Ankyrin Repeat and Protein Kinase Domain-Containing Protein One. This protein is a single protein target, also referred to as ANKK One, PKK Two, and SgK Two Eighty-Eight. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, specifically a TKL protein kinase belonging to the RIPK family.

The protein has various synonyms, including Ankyrin Repeat and Protein Kinase Domain-Containing Protein One, PKK Two, and SgK Two Eighty-Eight. It is associated with multiple gene ontology terms, including nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell projection, indicating its role in various cellular processes.

The protein also has multiple gene ontology functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity. Additionally, it is involved in various biological processes, such as protein phosphorylation, regulation of cell cycle process, and phosphorylation.
