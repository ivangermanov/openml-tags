Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original medical study focused on heart health. The data has been binarized, meaning the continuous numeric values have been converted into two distinct categories. This process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and then classifying all instances below this mean as positive ('P') and all instances above as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for a simplified analysis of the data, potentially making it more suitable for certain types of machine learning algorithms or statistical analyses.

The dataset includes various medical and demographic features related to heart health, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and other relevant factors. The binary classification of the target feature enables researchers to study the relationship between these various factors and the likelihood of a positive or negative outcome in heart health.

This binarized version of the dataset can be particularly useful for mythbusting studies and various medical research purposes. It provides a simplified yet informative view of the complex relationships between different health factors and heart-related outcomes.
