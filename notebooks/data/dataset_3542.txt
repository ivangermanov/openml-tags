QSAR-TID-11898 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin 2 receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin 2 receptor. The Neurokinin 2 receptor is a single protein, also known as Neurokinin A receptor, NK-2R, NK-2 receptor, SKR, and Substance-K receptor. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in peptide receptor activity.

The dataset has multiple features, including MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50, which are human-readable. However, the remaining features are FCFP6_1024, which are not human-readable.

The Neurokinin 2 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and tachykinin receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of acetylcholine secretion, intestine smooth muscle contraction, and luteinizing hormone secretion.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR data.
