QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values of compounds on drug target TID. The activity unit is pseudo pCI. The dataset has rows and features, including IDs and a class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is the Mu opioid receptor, also known as hMOP, MOP, MOR, M OR, and MOR. It is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. The receptor belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the peptide receptor and short peptide receptor subgroups within the opioid receptor classification.

Several related targets are listed, including opioid receptor combinations (mu and delta, mu and kappa, mu/kappa/delta) as well as receptor complexes (CCR/mu opioid receptor complex, Mu opioid receptor/Alpha A adrenergic receptor). 

Approved drugs targeting this receptor include naloxegol, naldemedine, fentanyl, dihydrocodeine, and buprenorphine. These act as either mu opioid receptor antagonists or agonists and have various approval dates and development phases.

The receptor is involved in numerous biological processes and functions, including G protein coupled receptor signaling, neuropeptide signaling, pain perception, calcium ion regulation, and opioid response pathways. It is found in cellular components such as the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, axons, dendrites, and synapses.

Multiple protein identifiers and classifications are provided, including Gene Ontology terms for cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. The receptor is also referenced in various databases such as UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
