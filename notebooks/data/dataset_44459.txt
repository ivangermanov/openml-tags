Subsampling of the dataset Compass with a specified seed value generates a subset of the original data. This process involves uniformly sampling classes and columns from the dataset, ensuring a balanced representation of each category.

The dataset Compass consists of multiple features, including Sex, Age, Race, Juvenile Felony Count, Juvenile Misdemeanor Count, Prior Convictions Count, Days Between Screening and Arrest, and Decile Score, among others.

To generate the subsampled dataset, a random number generator is used to select a specified number of classes and columns from the original dataset. The selection process is based on the value counts of each class and column, ensuring a representative sample.

Once the classes and columns are selected, the corresponding indices are used to subset the original dataset. This results in a new dataset with the specified number of rows, columns, and classes.

Stratification is applied to ensure that the subsampled dataset maintains the same proportion of each class as the original dataset. This is achieved by using a stratified sampling approach, which takes into account the class distribution when selecting the samples.

The resulting subsampled dataset is a new instance of the Compass dataset, with the specified number of rows, columns, and classes. The features of the dataset remain the same, but with a reduced number of instances.
