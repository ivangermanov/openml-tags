Compass Seed One Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the Compass dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed ten. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, retaining only the instances where one of these classes was present.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled, reducing the number of columns to one hundred. The dataset was further subsampled to contain a maximum of two thousand rows, while maintaining the stratification of the classes.

The resulting dataset contains a range of features, including demographic information, criminal history, and assessment scores. These features are crucial in understanding the complexities of the Compass dataset and can be used to develop predictive models that take into account the nuances of the data.

Features: sex, age, age category, race, juvenile felony count, juvenile misdemeanor count, juvenile other count, prior count, days between screening and arrest, days from Compass, charge degree, decile score, score text, type of assessment, decile score, score text, end, and is recid.
