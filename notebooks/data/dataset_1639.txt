QSAR-TID-11441 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11441. It has sixty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor-type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Beta. 

Receptor-type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Beta is a single protein and its preferred name is Receptor-type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Beta. It also has synonyms: Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase Beta, PTPB, PTPRB, Receptor-type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Beta, R-PTP-Beta.

It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and its protein target classification is enzyme/phosphatase/protein phosphatase/tyrosine protein phosphatase/receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase.

Keywords: QSAR, TID, ChEMBL, Receptor-type Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Beta, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, protein phosphatase, tyrosine protein phosphatase.
