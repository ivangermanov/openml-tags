Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Sylvine with seed equals two arguments n rows equals two thousand arguments n columns equals one hundred arguments n classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable. If there are more classes than the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes using a random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of each class. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is more than the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns using a random choice. It then selects the corresponding columns from the data.

If the number of rows is more than the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data accordingly. It concatenates the data and target variable, and then uses train test split to get a subset of the required size. It then drops the target variable from the subset and returns the dataset.
