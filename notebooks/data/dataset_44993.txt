Tags: Demographics, Geography 

The Health Insurance dataset is a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States in 1993, focusing on the relationship between health insurance and the number of hours worked by married women. Each instance in the dataset represents information about an individual married woman.

The attributes in this dataset provide insight into various aspects of a married woman's life, including her employment, health insurance coverage, demographic characteristics, and family situation.

The Hours Worked Per Week by Wife attribute serves as the target feature for this dataset. Additionally, there are several other features related to health insurance, such as whether the wife is covered by her husband's health insurance, whether she has health insurance through her own job, and whether her husband has health insurance through his job.

Other demographic characteristics include the wife's level of education, categorized into six different levels ranging from less than nine years of education to more than sixteen years of education; her racial background, classified as white, black, or other; and whether she identifies as Hispanic or not.

The dataset also includes information about the wife's work experience, measured in years, as well as the number of children she has under the age of six and between the ages of six and eighteen. Furthermore, it provides details about her husband's income and their geographic location within the United States, categorized into four regions: north-central, south, west, and other.
