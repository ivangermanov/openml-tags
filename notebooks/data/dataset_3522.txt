QSAR-TID-100629 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100629. The dataset has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100629. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase Gamma, which is a single protein target.

The Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase Gamma is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein dephosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and negative regulation of epithelial cell migration.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe, and provides a comprehensive overview of the Receptor-type Tyrosine-protein Phosphatase Gamma.
