QSAR-TID-11736 Dataset: Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11736. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Features include molecule Chembl ID, molecular fingerprints, and median pxc fifty.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

Please cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.
