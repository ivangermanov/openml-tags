This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex CHF/JPY pair obtained from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active on those days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The dataset provides information about the bid and ask prices at different points in time, including the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices, as well as the volume of transactions. Additionally, the class attribute indicates the direction of the mean close price for the following day compared to the current day. Specifically, if the mean close price is expected to increase, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.
