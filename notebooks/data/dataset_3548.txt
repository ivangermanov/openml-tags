QSAR-TID-101340 Dataset 

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101340. It has eighty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, molecular fingerprints, and so on.

The dataset was scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and so on.

The target classification is enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase/Eph family. The preferred name is ephrin type-A receptor one. The synonyms are eph, epha one, ephrin type-A receptor one, epht, epht one, and so on.

The organism is homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification.

The description is ephrin type-A receptor one single protein.

The relationship accession is ephrin type-A receptor one single protein.

There are various go components, go functions, and go processes associated with this target.
