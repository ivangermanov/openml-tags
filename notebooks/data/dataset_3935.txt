QSAR-TID-11766 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11766. The dataset has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11766. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Endothelin-converting enzyme one, which is a single protein target.

The Endothelin-converting enzyme one is a metallo protease that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including heart development, blood pressure regulation, and response to hypoxia. It is also involved in the processing of peptide hormones and the regulation of cAMP-mediated signaling pathways.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Endothelin-converting enzyme one. It can be used to build predictive models of compound activity and to identify potential lead compounds for further optimization.
