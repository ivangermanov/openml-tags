This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12247. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

The dataset has one thousand four hundred three rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The computational universe is a concept that describes the universe in terms of computational processes. It is based on the idea that the universe can be understood in terms of information processing and computation.

MTL QSAR is a machine learning approach that uses multiple-instance learning to predict the activities of molecules.

Study three is a research project that aims to develop new methods for predicting the activities of molecules.

Transportation is the movement of people, animals, and goods from one place to another.

Meta QSAR project is a research project that aims to develop new methods for predicting the activities of molecules.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12247. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.
