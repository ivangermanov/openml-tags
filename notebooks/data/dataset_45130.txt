**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete-medium model.

This network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

The preliminary model for barley was developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides".

This model features various factors, including thousand kernel weight, thousand kernel volume, and protein content, as well as sort and size characteristics. It also takes into account nitrogen and phosphorus levels, soil type, and pesticide use.
