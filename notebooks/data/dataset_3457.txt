Context 
While brainstorming ideas for a statistics project for a course last semester, the idea of utilizing data about microbreweries came up. Unfortunately, after some exploration and thought, we scrapped the idea, but I've got this data to show for it anyway.

Content 
The data was acquired from Beer Month Club and contains information about breweries available on the site as of October. The data includes information such as name, type of brewery, address, website, and state, among other things.

Acknowledgements 
Thanks to Beer Month Club for allowing the brew pub section to be scraped.

Inspiration 
This data alone isn't too inspiring, but maybe it could be used as the basis for an analysis project that looks into information such as Yelp reviews or number of links to a brewery's website. The possibilities for expansion are endless, and this dataset provides a solid foundation for exploring the world of microbreweries.

Features: brewery name, type, address, website, state
