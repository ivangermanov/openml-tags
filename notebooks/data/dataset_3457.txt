QSAR-TID-11399 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator is a single protein, also known as Alteplase or Reteplase, and is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in fibrinolysis. It is a key enzyme involved in the breakdown of blood clots and is used as a medication in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction of drug activity.
