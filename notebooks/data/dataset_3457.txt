The QSAR-TID-11399 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and should be cited accordingly. It shows activity values in units of pseudo-pCI50 of several compounds on drug target Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator.

Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Alteplase, Reteplase, PLAT, and others. It is an enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily classified under organism Homo sapiens and species group No Protein Target Classification.

The mechanism of action of this protein involves inhibition of serine-type endopeptidase activity, signaling receptor binding, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and phosphoprotein binding. It is involved in various biological processes including response to hypoxia, proteolysis, blood coagulation, negative regulation of plasminogen activation, smooth muscle cell migration, plasminogen activation, protein modification process, fibrinolysis, negative regulation of proteolysis, platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling pathway, and others.
