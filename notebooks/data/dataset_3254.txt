The QSAR-TID-101496 dataset is related to manufacturing and transportation, and it falls under the category of MTLQSAR and study three. This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, which was conducted in September 2015.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101496. The activity values are represented in units of pseudo-pCI50. There are seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features in this dataset, including IDs and class features. The molecular fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

The features in this dataset include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. There are also numerous fingerprint features, which are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds.
