QSAR-TID-101496 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred one thousand four hundred ninety-six, and it has a total of seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September two thousand fifteen. The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred one thousand four hundred ninety-six. The activity values are represented in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features of the dataset are Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular representation that can be used to describe the structure of molecules. The Fingerprints were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, from SMILES strings. The dataset has a total of one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.
