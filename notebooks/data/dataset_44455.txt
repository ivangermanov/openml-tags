Name: Road Safety

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Road Safety with seed equals two, args nrows max equals two thousand, args ncols max equals one hundred, args nclasses max equals ten, args no stratify equals True

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the Road Safety dataset. It takes in a seed value, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns randomly. It then filters the dataset to include only the selected columns.

Finally, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the dataset accordingly and selects a subset of the required size.
