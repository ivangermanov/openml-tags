QSAR-TID-103088 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103088. The dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset contains a total of one thousand twenty-six features, including the molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50.

The drug target TID: 103088 is a cystine/glutamate transporter, also known as amino acid transport system xc-. It is a single protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of amino acids across the cell membrane.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the cystine/glutamate transporter as a potential drug target.
