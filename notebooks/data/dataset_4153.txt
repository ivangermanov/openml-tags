Pol Dataset 

This dataset belongs to the Classification on Numerical Features benchmark. 

The Pol dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean of the target values and categorizing all instances with values below the mean as Positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as Negative, denoted by 'N'.

This dataset consists of various physical science and computer system-related features. The features included in this dataset are thirty-three in total.
