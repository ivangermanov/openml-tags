Title: Thoracic Surgery Data Data Set

Abstract: This dataset is dedicated to a classification problem related to post-operative life expectancy in lung cancer patients. The two classes are: death within one year after surgery, and survival beyond one year.

The data was collected retrospectively at Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre for patients who underwent major lung resections for primary lung cancer between 2007 and 2011. The Centre is associated with the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Wroclaw and Lower-Silesian Centre for Pulmonary Diseases, Poland. The research database is part of the National Lung Cancer Registry, administered by the Institute of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases in Warsaw, Poland.

Attribute Information:
- Diagnosis: specific combination of ICD-10 codes for primary and secondary as well as multiple tumors if any
- Forced vital capacity (FVC)
- Volume exhaled at the end of the first second of forced expiration (FEV1)
- Performance status on the Zubrod scale
- Pain before surgery
- Haemoptysis before surgery
- Dyspnoea before surgery
- Cough before surgery
- Weakness before surgery
- T in clinical TNM - size of the original tumor, from smallest to largest
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Myocardial infarction up to 6 months
- Peripheral arterial diseases
- Smoking
- Asthma
- Age at surgery
- One year survival period (True if died)

The class value (Risk1Y) is binary valued, indicating whether the patient survived beyond one year post-surgery or not. The dataset includes various numeric and categorical features related to the patient's medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic information.

This thoracic surgery dataset provides valuable information for predicting post-operative life expectancy in lung cancer patients, which can aid in treatment planning and patient care strategies.
