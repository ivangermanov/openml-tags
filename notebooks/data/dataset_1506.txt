This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

Features include molecule chembl id, and molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The data is related to a single protein preferred name, Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Edg-7, also known as Edg7, Lpa3, Lpa-3, Lpar3, and Lpa Receptor. The protein is classified under membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor small molecule receptor lipid-like ligand receptor Edg receptor.

The protein target classification is one, membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor small molecule receptor lipid-like ligand receptor Edg receptor. The description relationship accession is Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor three.
