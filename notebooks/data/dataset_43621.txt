The SP Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, also called the BSE Thirty or simply the Sensex, is a free-float market-weighted stock market index of thirty well-established and financially sound companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The thirty component companies, which are some of the largest and most actively traded stocks, are representative of various industrial sectors of the Indian economy.

This dataset, BSE Thirty Daily Market Price, contains data about these thirty stocks for ten years, starting from May sixth, two thousand eight, to May fourth, two thousand eighteen. The variables included are the symbol, or ticker, of each stock, the date, the opening price, the highest price, the lowest price, the closing price, the adjusted closing price, and the volume of shares traded.

The prices were fetched from Yahoo Finance.

This dataset can be used to explore various questions, such as which stocks were the most volatile or stable over the ten-year period, and whether it is possible to predict the next day's stock prices based on historical data.
