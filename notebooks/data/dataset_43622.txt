Binary Dataset of Phishing and Legitimate URLs
Tags: 

The dataset is provided in a CSV file, which offers a range of resources that can be utilized as inputs for model building. It comprises a collection of website URLs for various websites. Each sample has fifteen website parameters and a class label that identifies it as a phishing website or not. The class label is binary, where a label of zero indicates a phishing website, and a label of one indicates a legitimate website.

The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping, attempting to specify the functional and non-functional requirements for it. The dataset features a range of parameters, including the registration date, expiration date, and update date of the website's whois information, as well as the length of the URL, the count of digits, special characters, and hyphens, and the presence of double slashes, single slashes, and the at-the-rate symbol. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the protocol used and the count of protocols, as well as web traffic data.
