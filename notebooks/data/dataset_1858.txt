Life Science, Machine Learning, MTL QSAR, study 3 

The QSAR dataset contains information about the activity values of various compounds on the drug target identified as TID 11522. It consists of 1585 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features such as MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. 

The features in this dataset represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The Cholecystokinin B Receptor is a single protein that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is also known as CCK2 R, CCKBR, CCK B Receptor, and other synonyms. This receptor plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including gastric acid secretion, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathways.

The receptor is primarily expressed in the plasma membrane and is involved in the binding of peptide hormones, particularly gastrin and cholecystokinin. It also participates in the activation of phospholipase C and the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

Several molecules have been identified as antagonists of the Cholecystokinin B Receptor, including CI 988, Itriglumide, and Netazepide. These molecules have been shown to inhibit the activity of the receptor and may have potential therapeutic applications.
