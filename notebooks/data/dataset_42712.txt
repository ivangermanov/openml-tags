Bike Sharing Demand

Tags: OpenML-Reg19

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process, from membership to rental and return, has become automatic. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return it at another position. Currently, there are numerous bike-sharing programs around the world, comprising hundreds of thousands of bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.

Apart from the interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Unlike other transport services, such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing systems into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

Bike-sharing rental processes are highly correlated to environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, hour of the day, and so on can affect rental behaviors.

The core dataset is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years from the Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly available. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily bases and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information was extracted from a reliable source.

Attributes:

* Season: the season of the year
* Year: the year of the data
* Month: the month of the year
* Hour: the hour of the day
* Holiday: whether the day is a holiday or not
* Weekday: the day of the week
* Working Day: whether the day is a working day or not
* Weather Situation: the weather conditions
* Temperature: the normalized temperature in Celsius
* Feeling Temperature: the normalized feeling temperature in Celsius
* Humidity: the normalized humidity
* Wind Speed: the normalized wind speed
* Casual Users: the count of casual users
* Registered Users: the count of registered users
* Total Rental Bikes: the count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered users
