**Meta-Album OmniPrint-MD-mix Dataset (Mini)**

The OmniPrint-MD-mix dataset consists of synthesized images from seven hundred six categories. The images are synthesized with OmniPrint, and no further processing was done. The OmniPrint synthesis parameters are stated as follows: font size is set, image size is set, the strength of random perspective transformation is set, left, right, top, and bottom margins are all set as a percentage of the image size, the strength of pre-rasterization elastic transformation is set, random translation is activated both horizontally and vertically, rotation is within a certain range, horizontal shear is within a certain range, brightness is within a certain range, contrast is within a certain range, and color enhancement is within a certain range. The other parameters vary between images. We designed multiple settings, each setting is used to synthesize multiple images. All images and textures consist of photos taken by a personal mobile phone.
