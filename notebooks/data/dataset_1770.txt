QSAR-TID-100789 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100789. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The MetaQSAR project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for QSAR modeling and prediction of biological activities of small molecules. This dataset is part of the project and focuses on the drug target TID: 100789.

The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes multiple features, such as molecule Chembl ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features. 

The drug target TID: 100789 is a single protein known as Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase SRPK One. It is also referred to as Serine Arginine-Rich Protein-Specific Kinase One, SFRS Protein Kinase One, SRPK One, SR-Protein-Specific Kinase One, and SRSF Protein Kinase One.

This protein is found in humans and belongs to the species group of no protein target classification. It is classified as an enzyme kinase protein kinase CMGC protein kinase group CMGC protein kinase SRPK family.

The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization, nucleus organization, chromosome organization, cytoplasm organization, and endoplasmic reticulum organization. It is also involved in protein phosphorylation, RNA binding, and ATP binding.
