**Meta Album Boats Dataset**

The original version of the Meta Album boats dataset is called the Marvel dataset. It has a large collection of images of twenty-six different maritime vessels in their natural background. Each class can have a varying number of images of variable resolutions. To preprocess this dataset, we either duplicate the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right most three columns based on the orientation of the original image to create square images. No cropping was applied because the boats occupy most of the image, and applying this technique would lead to incomplete images. Finally, the square images were resized into a uniform size using an anti-aliasing filter.

**Dataset Details**

The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of images showcasing various types of boats in different settings. This dataset is ideal for researchers and developers working on image classification tasks, particularly in the domain of vehicle recognition.
