**Meta Album Boats Dataset (Mini)**

The original version of the Meta Album boats dataset is called the Marvel dataset, which is a large-scale image dataset for maritime vessels in their natural background. To preprocess this dataset, we either duplicate the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right most three columns based on the orientation of the original image to create square images. No cropping was applied because the boats occupy most of the image, and applying this technique will lead to incomplete images. Finally, the square images were resized into 128x128 pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
