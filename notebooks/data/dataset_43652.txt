Data is pulled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Skyserver from Data Release Sixteen using the following query. 

Select Photographic Object ID, Right Ascension, Declination, U Magnitude, G Magnitude, R Magnitude, I Magnitude, Z Magnitude, Observation Run Number, Rerun Number, Camera Column, Field Number, Spectroscopic Object ID, Class, Redshift, Plate ID, Observation Date, and Fiber ID into my database table from the Photographic Object table as p, joined with the Spectroscopic Object table as s on s Best Object ID equals p Object ID, where p U Magnitude is between zero and nineteen point six and G Magnitude is between zero and twenty.

Features include Object ID, Right Ascension, Declination, U Magnitude, G Magnitude, R Magnitude, I Magnitude, Z Magnitude, Observation Run Number, Rerun Number, Camera Column, Field Number, Spectroscopic Object ID, Class, Redshift, Plate ID, Observation Date, and Fiber ID.
