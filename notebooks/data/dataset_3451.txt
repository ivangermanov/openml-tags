QSAR-TID-100244 Dataset 

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred twenty-four, and it has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median px c fifty. 

The features represent fingerprints molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and fingerprints molecular fingerprints.
