QSAR-TID-100244 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100244. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100244. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate Fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists who want to study the activity of compounds on drug target TID: 100244.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The drug target is Rhizopuspepsin, which is a single protein and an aspartic protease. It belongs to the Aspartic protease A1A subfamily and has peptidase activity.

The dataset also contains information about the functions and processes of the drug target, including its GO functions, canSAR-Target, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe information.
