QSAR-TID-12347 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12347. The dataset has sixteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12347. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 12347, which is a Cytochrome P450 eleven B one enzyme.

Cytochrome P450 eleven B one is a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including lipid metabolic process, steroid biosynthetic process, and glucocorticoid biosynthetic process. It is also involved in the cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for Cytochrome P450 eleven B one enzyme. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of activity values for various compounds, which can be used to develop and validate QSAR models.
