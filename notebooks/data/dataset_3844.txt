Tumor MicroRNA Expression Profiling Identifies Circulating MicroRNAs for Earlier Breast Cancer Detection.

Due to microRNA's role in tumorigenesis and remarkable stability in body fluids, microRNAs are emerging as a promising diagnostic tool. The aim of this study was to identify tumor microRNA signatures for the discrimination of breast cancer and the intrinsic molecular subtypes, and the study in plasma of the status of the most significant ones in order to identify potential circulating biomarkers for breast cancer detection.

The dataset used in this study is called Primary Breast Cancer vs Normal Breast Tissue, which contains microarray expression data. Each column represents a microRNA name, and each row represents a sample.

This dataset provides an opportunity to practice making predictive models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms on gene expression profiling data.

Features include microRNA names, such as MicroRNA Nine Five P, MicroRNA One Hundred Five Five P, MicroRNA One Forty Six B Five P, and many others.
