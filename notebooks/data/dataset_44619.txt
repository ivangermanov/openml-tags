Name: Car Subsample with One Seed and Two Thousand Rows

Tags: Subsampling of the Car dataset with seed equal to one, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses a random number generator to select a subset of the data. The function first selects a subset of the classes, then selects a subset of the columns, and finally selects a subset of the rows. The selection of classes and columns is done uniformly at random, while the selection of rows is done using stratified sampling to ensure that the subsample has the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratified sampling. The function returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original, with the selected columns, rows, and classes.

Features: buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, number of persons, luggage boot size, safety features, and class.

Keywords: dataset subsampling, stratified sampling, random number generator, class distribution, feature selection.
