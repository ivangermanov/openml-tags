The Yacht Hydrodynamics Dataset 

Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of great significance for evaluating the ship's performance and for estimating the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity. 

The Delft data set comprises three hundred eight full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose. These experiments include twenty-two different hull forms, derived from a parent form closely related to the Standfast forty-three.

Attribute Information 

Variations concern hull geometry coefficients and the Froude number. The longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy is an adimensional feature. The prismatic coefficient is also an adimensional feature. The length-displacement ratio is another important adimensional feature. The beam-draught ratio is yet another adimensional feature. The length-beam ratio is also an adimensional feature. The Froude number is an adimensional feature. The measured variable is the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement, which is an adimensional feature.
