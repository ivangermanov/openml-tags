Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of a training set and a test set. Each example is a twenty-eight by twenty-eight grayscale image, associated with a label from ten classes. Fashion MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Raw data is available at GitHub.
