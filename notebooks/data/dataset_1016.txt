Name: Vowel
Tags: Dataset, Classification, Speech Recognition

This dataset is a binarized version of an original multi-class vowel recognition dataset. The original multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. In this conversion, the majority class has been relabeled as positive ('P') while all other classes have been relabeled as negative ('N'). The dataset contains various features related to vowel recognition, including information about the speaker, their sex, and several acoustic features. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets. The origin and creation date of the original dataset are unknown. This binarized version was created to facilitate binary classification tasks in machine learning and speech recognition research.

Features included in the dataset are:
- Train or Test indicator
- Speaker information
- Sex of the speaker
- Multiple acoustic features
- Binary class label
