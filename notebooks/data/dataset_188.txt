The Eucalyptus Soil Conservation dataset aims to determine which seedlots in a species are best suited for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. To achieve this, measurements were taken of various factors, including height, diameter by height, survival, and others. It is essential to note that eucalyptus trial methods underwent changes over time, with earlier trials primarily involving fifteen to thirty centimeter tall seedlings grown in peat plots, whereas later trials consisted of three replications of eight trees grown. This shift in methodology might contribute to less significant results.

Experimental data recording procedures warrant mention, particularly instances where no data was recorded due to experimental recording procedures. In such cases, the absence of a species from one replicate at a site was treated as a missing value. However, if a species was absent from two or more replicates at a site, it was excluded from the site's analyses. Additionally, there were instances of missing data for survival, vigor, insect resistance, stem form, crown form, and utility, particularly for data recorded at the Morea Station. This could be indicative of species mortality in those areas or a lack of data collection.
