The Meta Album MPII Human Pose Dataset (Mini) is a state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating articulated human pose estimation. This dataset includes approximately twenty-five thousand images containing over forty thousand people with annotated body joints. The images were systematically collected using an established taxonomy of everyday human activities.

The dataset covers a wide range of human activities, and each image is provided with an activity label. Each image was extracted from a YouTube video. Similar to other Meta Album datasets, this dataset has been preprocessed, and all images have been resized to 128x128 pixels.
