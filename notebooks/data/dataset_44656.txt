Tags: Subsampling of the Bioresponse dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Bioresponse dataset, generated with a seed of three. The subsample has a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsampling process was stratified to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the classes were uniformly sampled to select the desired number of classes. Then, the columns were uniformly sampled to select the desired number of columns. Finally, the rows were stratified sampled to select the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset has a subset of the original features, including D Three, D Nine, D Fifty Three, and so on.
