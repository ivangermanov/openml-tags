This dataset, known as webdata wXa, is tagged with mythbusting, study. It originates from libSVM, though the exact date is unknown. The dataset should be cited as referenced in "Advances in Kernel Methods - Support Vector Learning" published by MIT Press.

The webdata wXa dataset is a binary version of the famous webdata collection. It was retrieved from the libSVM site and underwent additional preprocessing beyond what was done originally. The creation process involved loading all web data datasets, both train and test sets, then joining the corresponding train and test subsets. Each file was normalized column-wise according to specific rules:

- Constant features (columns with only one value) were set to zero and removed due to sparsity.
- Binary features (columns with two values) had the more frequent value set to zero and the less frequent to one.
- Multinary or real features (columns with more than two values) were divided by their standard deviation.

After normalization, all eight files were merged into one and randomly sorted. Duplicate lines were removed in the final step. An R script detailing these preprocessing steps is available on GitHub.

The dataset contains numerous features, including Y and X through X, though the exact number of features is not specified. The features appear to be primarily numerical and may represent various attributes of web data.
