This dataset, Predicting Critical Heat Flux, tagged under Chemistry and Life Science, was prepared for a journal article titled "On the Prediction of Critical Heat Flux Using a Physics-Informed Machine Learning-Aided Framework". 

The dataset contains processed and compiled records of experimental critical heat flux and boundary conditions used for the research presented in the article. 

Acknowledgments are given for providing the data.

Features of this dataset include identifier, geometry, pressure, mass flux, exit equilibrium quality, effective diameter, hydraulic diameter, length, and experimentally measured critical heat flux.

Keywords: critical heat flux, physics-informed, machine learning, boundary conditions, experimental data
