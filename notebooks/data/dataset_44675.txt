Phishing Websites Dataset Seed Two

This dataset is a subsample of the Phishing Websites dataset, generated with a seed of two. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns to reduce the dataset size.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several arguments, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample. The function uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility.

The subsampling process first involves selecting a subset of classes. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, the function selects a random subset of classes, weighted by their frequency in the dataset. The function then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns. The function selects a random subset of column indices, sorts them, and filters the dataset to include only these columns.

Finally, the function stratifies the dataset according to the target variable and selects a random subset of rows, ensuring that the sample is representative of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset includes a range of features, including whether the URL has an IP address, the length of the URL, the presence of a shortening service, and the domain registration length. The dataset also includes features related to the website's content, such as the presence of a favicon, the use of HTTPS, and the presence of abnormal URLs.
