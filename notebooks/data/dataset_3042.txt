QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Galanin receptor, specifically Galanin receptor type. This is a single protein target classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein coupled receptor category, further subcategorized as a peptide receptor and short peptide receptor within the galanin receptor family. The preferred name is Galanin receptor, with synonyms including GAL R, Galanin receptor type, GALNR, GALR, and GALR.

The target is found in Homo sapiens and is associated with various cellular components including the plasma membrane, cilium, membrane, synapse, and non motile cilium. Its functions involve G protein coupled receptor activity, galanin receptor activity, and peptide hormone binding. The receptor participates in numerous biological processes such as signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, adenylate cyclase modulation, neuropeptide signaling, chemical synaptic transmission, learning or memory, feeding behavior, and transcription regulation.

Cross references for this target are provided from multiple databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, PharmGKB, Pharos, and Reactome. These references offer additional information on the protein structure, function, and related pathways.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is intended for use in quantitative structure activity relationship studies. It provides valuable information for researchers investigating drug interactions with the Galanin receptor and potential therapeutic applications.
