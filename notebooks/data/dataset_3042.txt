Identify Jets of Particles from the Large Hadron Collider 

This project involves identifying jets of particles generated by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using machine learning techniques for the study of ultra-low latency inference with High-Level Synthesis for Machine Learning (hls4ml).

The goal is to classify these jets into five categories: quark, gluon, W boson, Z boson, or top quark, based on sixteen high-level features.

The features used for classification include mass, multiplicity, and various other properties derived from the particle detectors.

This project is part of an ongoing effort to explore the application of machine learning algorithms in high-energy physics, particularly in the context of real-time data analysis.

The dataset used for this project is publicly available and has been specifically designed for the study of ultra-low latency inference with hls4ml.
