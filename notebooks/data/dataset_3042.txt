QSAR-TID-12886 Dataset 

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Galanin Receptor Three, and it has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Circular Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Galanin Receptor Three.

Galanin Receptor Three is also known as Single Protein, GAL Three R, Galanin Receptor Type Three, GALNR Three, GALR Three, and GALR-Three.

It is an integral component of the plasma membrane and cilium and is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway.
