QSAR-TID-10842 Tags: Education, MTLQSAR, Statistics, Study 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10842. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10842. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. 

The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The data was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it for any purpose.
