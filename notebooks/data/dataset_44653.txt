Name: Bioresponse Seed Zero with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the Bioresponse dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Bioresponse dataset, generated with a seed of zero. The subsample has a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsampling process was stratified to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the classes were uniformly sampled to select the desired number of classes. Then, the columns were uniformly sampled to select the desired number of columns. Finally, the rows were stratified and sampled to select the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset has a subset of the original features, which are not human-readable. The dataset is a subset of the original Bioresponse dataset, which has been modified to have a smaller number of rows, columns, and classes.
