Bioresponse Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

Tags: Machine Learning, Transportation 

Sub-sampling of the dataset Bioresponse with seed equal to zero arguments number rows equals two thousand arguments number columns equals one hundred arguments number classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true. 

Generated with the following source code:

This function sub-samples the dataset by uniformly selecting classes and then sampling from those classes. It also selects columns uniformly if required. If there are more rows than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the specified number of rows.

The function takes in several parameters including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and whether or not to use stratified sampling. It returns a sub-sampled dataset.
