The Friedman datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded according to their parameters, including colinearity degree and sample number. 

These datasets were created using the Friedman function, which includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is a complex equation that incorporates five features for input. 

To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 

These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity. 

Colinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features. 

The generated Friedman datasets have varying parameters, including the number of features and the number of samples. 

The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand. 

There are also five different colinearity degrees, ranging from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. 

The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
