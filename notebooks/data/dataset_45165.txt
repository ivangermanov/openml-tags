**Water Bayesian Network. Sample One.**

This Bayesian network repository reference is from bnlearn, a discrete medium model.

The Water Bayesian Network consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

This network model was designed to demonstrate an expert system for control of waste water treatment.

Features include various metrics related to waste water treatment, such as nitrogen levels, biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand.

Keywords: Bayesian network, waste water treatment, expert system, water quality metrics.
