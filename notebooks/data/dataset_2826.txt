PAR Ten Regression Dataset 

This dataset contains the PAR Ten performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of Mixed Integer Programming Library Two Thousand and Ten. 

The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the multi-threaded table of evaluations. 

The features were generated using the Mixed Integer Programming feature computation code from the University of British Columbia. 

To record runtimes of the feature computations, Run Solver was used. 

Part of Open Algorithm Challenge Twenty-Seventeen, also known as Mira.
