The QSAR-TID-10741 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10741. This dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited accordingly.

The dataset contains information about the Cytochrome P four fifty-one enzyme, also known as Lanosterol fourteen alpha demethylase. This enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including lipid metabolic process, steroid biosynthetic process, and cholesterol biosynthetic process.

Cytochrome P four fifty-one is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the metabolism of steroids and lipids. It has monooxygenase activity and is able to bind to iron ions and heme.

This enzyme is also involved in various cellular components, including the acrosomal vesicle, endoplasmic reticulum, and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle.

Keywords: QSAR, Cytochrome P450, Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, lipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, cholesterol biosynthesis.
