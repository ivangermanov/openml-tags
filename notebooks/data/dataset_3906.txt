QSAR-TID-10741 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10741. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10741. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 10741, which is a Cytochrome P450 enzyme.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in the metabolism of various compounds, including drugs and steroids. They are involved in the breakdown of these compounds into more water-soluble forms, which can then be excreted from the body.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs and therapies targeting Cytochrome P450 enzymes. By analyzing the activity values of various compounds on this enzyme, researchers can gain insights into the structure-activity relationships of these compounds and design new molecules with improved potency and selectivity.
