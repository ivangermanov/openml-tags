This dataset, named mtp and tagged as study, is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset contains information related to molecular descriptors influencing melting point and their role in classification of solid drugs. It also includes data on neighborhood behavior, which is a useful concept for validation of molecular diversity descriptors.

Other related datasets cover topics such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), biodegradability prediction, structure-function relationships of modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The features in this dataset are derived from various molecular properties and characteristics, though many are represented in an encoded format that is not readily human-readable.

This dataset and its related studies contribute to the fields of medicinal chemistry, drug design, and computational chemistry. They provide valuable insights into the relationships between molecular structure and various properties or activities of chemical compounds.
