Swiss Banknote Counterfeit Detection

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Context:
This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to test various outlier detection algorithms on a challenging task: identifying genuine and counterfeit banknotes when a significant portion of the data consists of counterfeits.

Content:
The dataset comprises two hundred banknotes, evenly divided between genuine and counterfeit notes. Each note is characterized by its physical attributes, along with a label indicating its authenticity.

Attributes:

* Authenticity: Whether a banknote is authentic (zero) or counterfeit (one)
* Bill Length: The length of the banknote in millimeters
* Left Edge Width: The width of the left edge of the banknote in millimeters
* Right Edge Width: The width of the right edge of the banknote in millimeters
* Bottom Margin Width: The width of the bottom margin of the banknote in millimeters
* Top Margin Width: The width of the top margin of the banknote in millimeters
* Diagonal Length: The length of the diagonal of the banknote in millimeters

Applications:
While a classifier may easily distinguish between genuine and counterfeit banknotes, this dataset presents an intriguing challenge for outlier detection methods. Since half of the data consists of counterfeits, traditional outlier detection techniques are likely to fail. Therefore, more robust methods will be required to successfully identify the authentic banknotes amidst the counterfeits.
