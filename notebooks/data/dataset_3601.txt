QSAR-TID-13000 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase One, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase One. Matrix Metalloproteinase One is a single protein, also known as Interstitial Collagenase, Fibroblast Collagenase, and Collagenase. It is an enzyme, a protease, and a metallo protease, belonging to the Metallo protease MAM clan and Metallo protease M10A subfamily.

The dataset has multiple features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit features. These features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Matrix Metalloproteinase One is a target for several compounds, including Rebimastat, Marimastat, and Doxycycline Anhydrous. These compounds are small molecules that inhibit Matrix Metalloproteinase One.

Matrix Metalloproteinase One is involved in several biological processes, including proteolysis, protein metabolic process, extracellular matrix disassembly, and collagen catabolic process. It is also involved in the cellular response to UV-A.
