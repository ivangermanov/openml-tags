Worldwide Meat Consumption

Tags: Context

Meat consumption is closely related to living standards, diet, livestock production, and consumer prices, as well as macroeconomic uncertainty and shocks to Gross Domestic Product. Compared to other commodities, meat is characterized by high production costs and high output prices. Meat demand is associated with higher incomes and a shift, due to urbanization, to food consumption changes that favor increased proteins from animal sources in diets. While the global meat industry provides food and a livelihood for billions of people, it also has significant environmental and health consequences for the planet.

This dataset was refreshed, with world meat projections presented for beef and veal, pig, poultry, and sheep. Meat consumption is measured in thousand tonnes of carcass weight, except for poultry, which is expressed as ready-to-cook weight, and in kilograms of retail weight per capita. Carcass weight to retail weight conversion factors are: point seven for beef and veal, point seventy-eight for pig meat, and point eighty-eight for both sheep meat and poultry meat. The dataset excludes Iceland but includes all twenty-eight European Union member countries.

Content

The csv file has five columns: Location, which is the country code name; Subject, which is the type of meat, such as pig, beef, etc; Time, which is the year the data was recorded; Measure, which is the measure used to show the value; and Value, which is the value according to the measure.

Ask questions such as: What country had the most meat consumption? What years had the most worldwide meat consumption? Is there any correlation between the type of meat and the amount being consumed?
