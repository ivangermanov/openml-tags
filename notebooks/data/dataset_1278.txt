This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11156, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It provides valuable information for researchers studying the Bradykinin B1 receptor, also known as B1 bradykinin receptor, B1R, BDKRB1, BK-1 receptor, and BRADYB1. This receptor is a single protein found in humans and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor group.

The Bradykinin B1 receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including negative regulation of protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of leukocyte migration, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in response to mechanical stimulus, cell migration, negative regulation of cell growth, response to lipopolysaccharide, and negative regulation of blood pressure.

The dataset contains information about small molecules that act as Bradykinin B1 receptor antagonists, including their mechanism of action and maximum phase. These molecules have potential therapeutic applications and have been studied extensively in various research papers.
