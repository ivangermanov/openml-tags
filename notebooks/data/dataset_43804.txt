MAGIC Gamma Telescope Data Set 

Tags: Life Science, Medicine 

The MAGIC gamma telescope data set simulates the registration of high-energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. This type of telescope observes high-energy gamma rays by taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas and developing in the atmosphere. The Cherenkov radiation, which ranges from visible to ultraviolet wavelengths, leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing the reconstruction of the shower parameters.

The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of a few hundred to several thousand Cherenkov photons get collected, forming patterns, known as the shower image, which allow for statistical discrimination between those caused by primary gammas (signal) and the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).

Typically, the image of a shower after some preprocessing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, meaning the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, resulting in a correlation axis and defining an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse, often referred to as Hillas parameters, are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination.

The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. Additionally, there are further discriminating characteristics, such as the extent of the cluster in the image plane or the total sum of depositions. The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, which allows observing events with energies down to below fifty gigaelectronvolts.
