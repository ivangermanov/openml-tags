FOREX Eur Jpy Hour High Dataset 

Tags: Economics, Finance, Forex, Forex High, Forex Hour, Health 

This dataset consists of historical price data of the Foreign Exchange Rate Eur/Jpy from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one hour. The entire dataset spans a specific date range, excluding weekends, as the Foreign Exchange Market is not traded on weekends. The time zone of the feature timestamp is Europe Amsterdam.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the high bid and the high ask of the following hour, relative to the high bid and high ask mean of the current minute. This means the class attribute is true when the mean high price is increasing in the following hour, and the class attribute is false when the mean high price is decreasing or remains the same in the following hour.

Please note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trade strategies should only be applied to predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.
