**Image Segmentation Data Set**

The instances were drawn randomly from a database of seven outdoor images. The images were hand-segmented to create a classification for every pixel. Each instance is a three by three region.

**Major Changes**

The first two variables were ignored as they do not fit the classification task, as they reflect the location of the sample in the original image. The third variable is constant, so it should also be ignored.

**Attribute Information**

The data set includes various attributes that describe the characteristics of each region. These attributes include the results of a line extraction algorithm that counts the number of lines of a certain length and contrast that go through the region. Additionally, there are attributes that measure the contrast of horizontally and vertically adjacent pixels, which are used for edge detection. The data set also includes attributes that describe the color and intensity of the region, such as the average red, green, and blue values, as well as the excess red, blue, and green values. Furthermore, there are attributes that describe the value, saturation, and hue of the region, which are calculated using a three-dimensional nonlinear transformation of the RGB values.

**Scraped Data**

The data set does not have any missing values.
