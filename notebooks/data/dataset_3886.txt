QSAR-TID-95 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 95. The dataset has thirty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 95. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Luteinizing hormone/Choriogonadotropin receptor, which is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including ovulation, spermatogenesis, and hormone-mediated signaling pathways.

The receptor is a single protein that is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, hormone-mediated signaling pathways, and response to xenobiotic stimuli.

The dataset provides information about the receptor's expression, function, and regulation, as well as its role in various diseases and disorders, including Leydig cell hypoplasia, precocious puberty, and luteinizing hormone resistance.
