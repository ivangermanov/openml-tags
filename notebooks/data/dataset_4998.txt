Andes Bayesian Network. Sample Two.

This Bayesian network repository reference is available online.

The Andes network has a large number of nodes, with two hundred twenty-three nodes in total. It also has a significant number of arcs, with three hundred thirty-eight arcs present. The number of parameters is equally impressive, with one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, while the average degree is around three point zero three. The maximum in-degree is six.

This Bayesian network was designed for online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It is particularly useful in the field of chemistry, where problem-solving skills are essential.

Some of the key features of this network include nodes related to problem identification, goal setting, and resolution. There are also nodes related to applying concepts, finding solutions, and maximizing outcomes. Other features include nodes focused on vectors, forces, and motion.
