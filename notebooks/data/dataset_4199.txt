Diabetes Dataset 

The Diabetes dataset comprises ten baseline variables, including age, gender, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, which were collected for each of the diabetes patients. Additionally, the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, was also recorded.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

This dataset consists of a significant number of instances, with numerous attributes that are primarily numeric predictive values. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Attribute Information:**

The ten feature variables include Age, which represents the patient's age in years; Gender; Body Mass Index; Average Blood Pressure; Total Serum Cholesterol; Low-Density Lipoproteins; High-Density Lipoproteins; Total Cholesterol divided by High-Density Lipoprotein; Log of Serum Triglycerides Level; and Blood Sugar Level. 

It is noteworthy that each of these ten feature variables has undergone mean centering and scaling by the standard deviation times the square root of the sample size. As a result, the sum of squares of each column totals one.
