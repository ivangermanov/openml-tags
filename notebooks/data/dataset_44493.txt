Name: Numerai Dataset Subsample

Tags: Subsampling of the Numerai dataset with stratification

This dataset is a subsample of the original Numerai dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows. The goal was to create a smaller dataset that retains the essential characteristics of the original dataset.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by randomly choosing classes from the unique values in the target variable, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the rows where the target variable belonged to one of the selected classes.

Next, the columns of the dataset were sampled uniformly. If the number of columns exceeded a certain threshold, a random subset of columns was selected. The columns were sorted in ascending order to ensure consistency.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were sampled uniformly. If the number of rows exceeded a certain threshold, a stratified sampling approach was used to ensure that the resulting dataset retained the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, with the categorical columns converted to string format for compatibility with OpenML.
