Machine Learning Dataset: Numerai Twenty Eight Point Six 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Numerai Twenty Eight Point Six dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns to reduce the dimensionality of the data. 

The dataset has been subsampled using a random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of the results. A maximum number of rows and columns have been specified to control the size of the dataset. Furthermore, the number of classes has also been limited to reduce complexity.

In order to maintain class balance, stratified sampling has been employed. This involves dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels and then randomly selecting samples from each subset. This approach helps prevent overfitting to a particular class.

The dataset consists of various attributes, including attribute zero, attribute one, attribute two, attribute three, attribute four, attribute five, attribute six, attribute seven, attribute eight, attribute nine, attribute ten, attribute eleven, attribute twelve, attribute thirteen, attribute fourteen, attribute fifteen, attribute sixteen, attribute seventeen, attribute eighteen, attribute nineteen, attribute twenty, and attribute twenty-one.
