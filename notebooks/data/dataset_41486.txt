The Supply Chain Management dataset is derived from the Trading Agent Competition in Supply Chain Management tournament. The dataset is a result of a thorough preprocessing and normalization of the original data, which is described in detail elsewhere. This dataset corresponds to the Product Future prediction type, where each row represents an observation day in the tournament. The input variables in this domain are observed prices for a specific tournament day, along with four time-delayed observations for each observed product and component to facilitate anticipation of trends going forward.

The dataset contains sixteen regression targets, each corresponding to the next day mean price or mean price for twenty days in the future for each product in the simulation. Days with no target values are excluded from the dataset, meaning days with labels that are beyond the end of the game are not included.

The dataset features a range of variables, including time unit, storage cost, interest rate, and various component and demand segment indices. Additionally, the dataset includes variables related to stock-keeping units and market trends.
