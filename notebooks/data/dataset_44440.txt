Name: Eye Movements Seed Two Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Eye Movements dataset generated with the following source code:

This dataset is a subsample of the original Eye Movements dataset, with a seed value of two. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The subsampling process started by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded the maximum allowed, a random sample of classes was chosen based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices of the selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, reducing its size.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce their number. If the number of columns exceeded the maximum allowed, a random sample of columns was chosen, and the dataset was filtered accordingly.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce their number. If the number of rows exceeded the maximum allowed, a stratified sampling approach was used to ensure that the resulting dataset maintained the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the following features: Line Number, Assignment Number, First Fixation, Second Fixation, Previous Fixation Duration, First Fixation Duration, First Pass Fixation Duration, Next Fixation Duration, First Saccade Length, Last Saccade Length, Previous Fixation Position, Landing Position, Leaving Position, Total Fixation Duration, Mean Fixation Duration, Regression Length, Next Word Regression, Regression Duration, Pupil Diameter Maximum, Pupil Diameter Lag, Time Protection, Title Number, Word Number, and Label.
