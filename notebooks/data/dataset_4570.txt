Machine Learning and Mathematics Dataset: QSAR Biodeg 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the QSAR Biodeg dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting the indices where one of these classes is present, and then sampling columns and rows accordingly.

The goal of this subsampling process was to reduce the number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining a representative sample of the original dataset. This involved selecting a subset of classes based on their frequency in the original dataset, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of features and samples, carefully chosen to preserve the characteristics of the original dataset. The features included in this dataset are not easily interpretable, but they have been carefully selected to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
