Please cite: Binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion was originally performed by an individual researcher.

Features: The dataset includes various features related to molecular biology promoters, such as class, instance, and numerous positional attributes. These attributes likely represent genetic sequences or other molecular characteristics relevant to promoter regions.

Binary Class: The target variable has been simplified into a binary classification, distinguishing between positive and negative instances of promoters.

This dataset appears to be designed for studying and analyzing molecular biology promoters, with a focus on binary classification tasks. It may be useful for researchers and students in the fields of genetics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology who are interested in promoter prediction or classification.
