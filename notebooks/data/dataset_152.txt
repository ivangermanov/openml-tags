Name: Hyperplane Tags: concept drift, study, synthetic

Features: attribute one, attribute two, attribute three, attribute four, attribute five, attribute six, attribute seven, attribute eight, attribute nine, attribute ten, class

This dataset, known as Hyperplane, is designed for studying concept drift in machine learning scenarios. It is a synthetic dataset created to simulate changing patterns over time. The dataset includes multiple attributes, each representing different aspects of the simulated environment. These attributes are used to capture various dimensions of the data points, allowing for complex interactions and relationships. The class feature serves as the target variable, which the model aims to predict based on the given attributes. This synthetic dataset provides a controlled environment for researchers to investigate and develop algorithms capable of adapting to evolving data distributions and changing relationships between features and the target variable.
