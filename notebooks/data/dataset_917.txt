Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target variable into a binary classification by using the mean value as a threshold. Instances below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are labeled as negative. This type of data conversion is often used in machine learning and statistical analysis to simplify complex regression problems into more straightforward classification tasks. The dataset is associated with various studies and a mythbusting theme, suggesting its potential use in challenging or verifying common assumptions in data science or related fields.
