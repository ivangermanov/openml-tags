**Meta Album PanNuke Dataset (Mini)**

The PanNuke dataset is a semi-automatically generated segmentation and classification task of nuclei. The dataset contains images of nineteen different tissue types. For the Meta Album meta-dataset, even though this dataset was designed as a segmentation task, we were able to transform it into a tissue classification task since we had the tissue type for each sample in the dataset. We also resized the images to a uniform size and applied stain normalization to avoid bias and remove some spurious features.
