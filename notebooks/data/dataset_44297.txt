**Meta Album PanNuke Dataset (Mini)**

The PanNuke dataset is a semi-automatically generated segmentation and classification task of nuclei. This dataset contains images of nineteen different tissue types. Although this dataset was originally designed as a segmentation task, we transformed it into a tissue classification task since we had the tissue type for each sample in the dataset. We also resized the images to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels and applied stain normalization to avoid bias and remove some spurious features.
