This Credit-G dataset classifies individuals described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. The dataset comes with a cost matrix, which highlights the importance of accurate classification. Specifically, it is worse to classify a customer as good when they are actually bad, rather than the reverse. 

The dataset includes various features that describe an individual's financial situation, including their loan duration, credit amount, installment commitment, length of time at their current residence, age, number of existing credits, and number of dependents. Additionally, information about their checking status, credit history, purpose of the loan, savings status, employment, personal status, and other relevant details are also included.
