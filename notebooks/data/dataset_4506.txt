Subsampling of the Dionis dataset with a Seed of One 

Tags: Subsampling of the Dionis dataset 

This dataset is a subsample of the Dionis dataset, which originally had forty-one thousand one hundred sixty-seven instances. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset to a more manageable size.

The uniform sampling of classes involved selecting a specified maximum number of classes while maintaining their original distribution. This was achieved through probability proportional to the value counts of each class. 

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled based on a specified maximum number of columns. This involved randomly selecting column indices and then sorting them to ensure consistency.

Finally, the rows were sampled according to a specified maximum number of rows. This was done using stratified sampling to maintain the original class distribution. The stratification was based on the target variable, and the sampling was performed using a random state to ensure reproducibility.

The resulting dataset consists of the subsampled instances with their corresponding feature values and class labels. The feature names have been retained as they were in the original dataset.
