QSAR-TID-10494 Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10494. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The molecular fingerprints do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September 2015.

The data shows activity values, measured in pseudo-pCI50 units, of multiple compounds on the drug target Cathepsin G, also known as Cathepsin G, C-terminal truncated form CTSG. 

Cathepsin G is an enzyme belonging to the serine protease family, specifically the PA clan and S1A subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including angiotensin maturation, monocyte chemotaxis, protein phosphorylation, proteolysis, and immune response.

This enzyme is primarily located in the extracellular region, cytoplasm, nucleus, lysosome, and plasma membrane. It plays a crucial role in defense responses to bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens, and is also involved in neutrophil-mediated killing of Gram-positive bacteria.
