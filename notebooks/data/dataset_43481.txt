Cosmetics Datasets Tags: Context

Whenever I want to try a new cosmetic item, it's extremely challenging to make a decision. In fact, it's often intimidating because new items that I've never tried before can end up causing skin problems. We are all aware that the information we need is printed on the back of each product, but it's really difficult to decipher those ingredient lists unless you have a strong background in chemistry. You may be able to relate to this frustrating situation.

We are going to create a content-based recommendation system where the content will be the chemical components of cosmetics. Specifically, we will process ingredient lists for cosmetics on Sephora via word embedding, then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh. Let's take a closer look at our data first.
