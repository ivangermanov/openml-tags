This Automobile dataset consists of three types of entities: the specification of an automobile in terms of various characteristics, its assigned insurance risk rating, and its normalized losses in use as compared to other automobiles. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the automobile is more risky than its price indicates. Automobiles are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky or less, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up or down the scale. Actuarians call this process "symboling." A value of plus three indicates that the automobile is risky, minus three that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all automobiles within a particular size classification, such as two-door small, station wagons, sports/specialty, etc., and represents the average loss per car per year. Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a class attribute.

Sources include the 1985 Model Import Car and Truck Specifications, the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook, Personal Auto Manuals from the Insurance Services Office, and the Insurance Collision Report from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
