This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex Euro-Singapore Dollar pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one hour. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The dataset provides detailed information about the bidding and asking prices during each hourly interval. Specifically, it includes the opening, high, low, and closing bid and ask prices, as well as the volume of bids and asks.
