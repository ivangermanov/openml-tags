**Link Bayesian Network**

The Link Bayesian network repository is a discrete very large dataset referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian network repository.

This dataset consists of seven hundred twenty-four nodes and one thousand one hundred twenty-five arcs, resulting in fourteen thousand two hundred eleven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point eight, while the average degree is three point one one.

The maximum in-degree of this network is three.

The dataset is characterized by its complex structure, making it an ideal test case for Bayesian network learning algorithms.

**Features**

This dataset includes various features, including those related to linkage analysis, pedigree structures, and genetic markers.
