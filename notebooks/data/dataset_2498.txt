In the early two thousands, the Oakland Athletics faced a significant challenge. While they were expected to compete with teams that had much deeper pockets, they lacked the financial resources to do so. This is where statistics came into play, providing a solution to their problem.

This data set contains some of the information that was available at the time, and it can be used to better understand how the Oakland Athletics overcame their financial constraints. 

Attributes 
This data set contains a set of variables that were crucial to understanding the game of baseball. On-base percentage and slugging percentage were considered essential metrics, as they directly impacted a team's ability to score runs.

The variables included in this data set are: Team, League, Year, Runs Scored, Runs Allowed, Wins, On-Base Percentage, Slugging Percentage, Batting Average, Playoffs, Rank Season, Rank Playoffs, Games Played, Opponent On-Base Percentage, and Opponent Slugging Percentage.
