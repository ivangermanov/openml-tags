The Credit Seed Three N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True dataset is a subsampled version of the original Credit dataset. This subsampling process was carried out using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of three, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. Additionally, the stratification argument was set to true.

The subsampling process involved several steps. Firstly, the unique classes in the dataset were identified, and if there were more than ten classes, a selection of ten classes was made based on their frequency distribution. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to subset the dataset.

Next, if the number of columns in the dataset exceeded one hundred, a random selection of one hundred columns was made. Otherwise, all columns were retained. Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset exceeded two thousand, a stratified sampling approach was employed to select a subset of two thousand rows.

The resulting dataset consists of a set of features, including Revolving Utilization of Unsecured Lines, Age, Debt Ratio, Monthly Income, and Number of Dependents. This dataset is useful for statistical analysis and modeling in the context of manufacturing and related fields.
