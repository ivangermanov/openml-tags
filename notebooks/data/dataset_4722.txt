The guillermo dataset has been subsampled with the following parameters: seed equals two, maximum number of rows equals two thousand, maximum number of columns equals one hundred, maximum number of classes equals ten, and stratified sampling has been set to true.

This subsampling process has generated a new dataset with the following characteristics: the uniform sampling of classes ensures that all classes have an equal representation in the dataset; the uniform sampling of columns reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the most important features; and the stratified sampling of rows maintains the class balance in the dataset.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, which are:
