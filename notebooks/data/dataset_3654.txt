QSAR-TID-100833 Dataset: Life Science, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand eight hundred thirty-three, and it has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints from zero to nine hundred ninety-eight.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The target is a single protein, namely Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Fifteen, also known as ERK Seven, ERK Eight, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CMGC protein kinase group, and CMGC protein kinase MAPK family.

The protein is involved in various cellular components, including extracellular region, nucleus, cytoplasm, autophagosome, Golgi apparatus, centriole, spindle, cytoskeleton, cell-cell junction, bicellular tight junction, axoneme, cytoplasmic vesicle, ciliary basal body, cell projection, anchoring junction, and meiotic spindle.

It is also associated with various biological processes, including nucleotide binding, chromatin binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, SH three domain binding, protein serine kinase activity, MAPK cascade, regulation of COPII vesicle coating, protein phosphorylation, DNA damage response, endoplasmic reticulum organization, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, regulation of autophagy, phosphorylation, negative regulation of cell migration, positive regulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase, intracellular signal transduction, protein autophosphorylation, positive regulation of telomerase activity, dopamine uptake, regulation of cilium assembly, positive regulation of telomere capping, protein localization to ciliary transition zone, and positive regulation of metaphase anaphase transition of meiosis one.
