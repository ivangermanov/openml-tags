QSAR-TID-100833 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Fifteen, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP features.

Scraped Data: ID: CHEMBL Type: SINGLE PROTEIN Preferred Name: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Fifteen Synonyms: ERK Seven, ERK Eight, and others. Organism: Homo sapiens Species Group: No Protein Target Classification: Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase MAPK family.
