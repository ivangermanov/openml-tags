QSAR-TID-10057 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10057. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Cannabinoid CB2 receptor.

The Cannabinoid CB2 receptor is a single protein that is primarily found in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of cells. It is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and response to stimulus.

The receptor is also known by several synonyms, including Cannabinoid receptor two, CB two, and Cnr two. It is classified as a membrane receptor and is part of the Family A G protein-coupled receptor group.
