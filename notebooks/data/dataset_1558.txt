The features include demographic information, financial indicators, and details about previous marketing contacts. The target variable, labeled as "Class", likely indicates whether a customer subscribed to the marketed product or service.

This dataset provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the fields of marketing analytics, customer relationship management, and predictive modeling in the banking sector. It allows for the exploration of factors influencing the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns in financial services.
