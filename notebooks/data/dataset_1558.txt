This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset provides information about a single protein, specifically the Vasopressin V2 receptor, also known as Antidiuretic Hormone Receptor, AVPR2, AVPR V2, Renal-type Arginine Vasopressin Receptor, and V2R. This receptor belongs to the species group of Sus scrofa and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by vasopressin, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of gene expression, cellular response to hormone stimulus, and positive regulation of vasoconstriction. Additionally, it exhibits G protein-coupled receptor activity, vasopressin receptor activity, and peptide binding.

The dataset was generated through the MetaQSAR project in September and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, Vasopressin V2 receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, signal transduction, hormone stimulus, vasoconstriction.
