The KDD Cup 2009 Upselling dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of parameters to generate a new dataset. This subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has been generated with a seed value of three, which ensures reproducibility of the subsampling process. The maximum number of rows has been limited to two thousand, while the maximum number of columns has been capped at one hundred. Furthermore, the number of classes has been restricted to ten.

Stratification has been applied during the subsampling process to maintain the class distribution of the original dataset. This involves selecting a subset of classes based on their frequency in the original dataset, and then sampling rows and columns accordingly.

The subsampled dataset consists of various chemical and physical features, including variables related to molecular properties and reactions. These features have been carefully selected to represent a diverse range of characteristics relevant to the upselling task.
