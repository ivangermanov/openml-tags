Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample Nine.

The Hepar2 Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network consists of seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, resulting in one thousand four hundred fifty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, while the average degree is three point five one. Furthermore, the maximum in-degree is six.

This network focuses on modeling probabilistic causal relationships in medicine, specifically in the diagnosis of liver disorders. It encompasses a wide range of features, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, state of consciousness, amylase levels, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint issues, platelet count, VH amplitude, spider nevi, spleen condition, age, jaundice, HBsAg antibody presence, chronic hepatitis, itching sensation, steatosis, sex, history of injections, HBsAg presence, cirrhosis, palmar symptoms, abdominal pain, HCV antibody presence, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase levels, rheumatic heart disease, gallstone presence, gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, primary biliary cirrhosis, alanine transaminase levels, bilirubin levels, liver fibrosis, aspartate transaminase levels, HB e antigen presence, skin condition, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, thrombotic hepatitis, HBc antibody presence, right upper quadrant pressure, alcohol consumption, LE cells presence, antimitochondrial antibody presence, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites presence, hospitalization, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, liver density, blood transfusion, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, liver carcinoma, edge detection, edema, fatty liver, and history of alcoholism or surgical interventions.
