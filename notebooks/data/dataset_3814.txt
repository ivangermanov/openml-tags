QSAR-TID-12592 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase 9, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase 9. Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 is a single protein, also known as 67 kDa Matrix Metalloproteinase-9, 82 kDa Matrix Metalloproteinase-9, 92 kDa Gelatinase, 92 kDa Type IV Collagenase, CLG4B, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M10A subfamily.

Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 is involved in various biological processes, including skeletal system development, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, proteolysis, apoptotic process, embryo implantation, cell migration, extracellular matrix disassembly, extracellular matrix organization, macrophage differentiation, collagen catabolic process, cellular response to reactive oxygen species, endodermal cell differentiation, positive regulation of apoptotic process, negative regulation of apoptotic process, and many others.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and analysis.
