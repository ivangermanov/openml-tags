About Our Dataset

The journey of collecting this Covid nineteen India dataset began with a competition where we had to perform sentiment analysis of tweets. The data was collected from the Coronavirus Covid nineteen Tweets Dataset website, which provided us with the tweet IDs of relevant tweets. To extract the tweets' text and other information, we utilized the Hydrator application.

About Features of Dataset

There are a total of five columns in the dataset. The first column, labeled as "Text ID," contains a unique identifier for each tweet. The second column, "Text," comprises the actual tweet text corresponding to that particular tweet ID. The third column, "Date," represents the date on which the tweet was posted. The fourth column, "Location," indicates the place from where the tweet originated. The fifth column, "Sentiments," denotes the sentiment value of that tweet, which can be classified as either positive, negative, or neutral. Specifically, if the sentiment score is greater than zero, the sentiment is considered positive; if the score equals zero, the sentiment is deemed neutral; and if the score is less than zero, the sentiment is regarded as negative.

Acknowledgments

We would not have been able to accomplish this task without the assistance of others. We would like to extend our gratitude to the Coronavirus Covid nineteen Tweets Dataset website for providing the tweet IDs. Additionally, we appreciate the Hydrator application for fetching the tweets.
