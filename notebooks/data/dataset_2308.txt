QSAR-TID-103062 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103062. It has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty. 

The features represent fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systèmes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fingerprints, and median pxc fifty.
