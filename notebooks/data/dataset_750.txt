Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on air quality measurements, specifically PM10 concentration levels. It includes various environmental factors that may influence particulate matter levels, such as traffic density, temperature at different heights, wind speed and direction, and time of day. The original continuous target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem, allowing for easier analysis of PM10 concentration thresholds.

The dataset is designed for use in regression and classification studies, particularly those investigating air pollution patterns and their relationship to urban and meteorological factors. It may be valuable for researchers and policymakers interested in understanding and mitigating air quality issues in urban environments.

Features include PM10 concentration, cars per hour, temperature at two meters, wind speed, temperature difference between two and twenty-five meters, wind direction, hour of day, and binary class.
