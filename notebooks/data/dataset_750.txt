The PM10 dataset is a binarized regression problem that originates from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This particular version of the dataset is a modified rendition of the original, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset encompasses a range of features, including Concentration of PM10, Cars per Hour, Temperature at Two Meters, Wind Speed, Temperature Difference between Two Meters and Twenty-Five Meters, Wind Direction, and Hour of Day. These features have been carefully selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying phenomenon.
