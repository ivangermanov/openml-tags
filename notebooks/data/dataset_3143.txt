QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is a serine protein kinase ATR, also known as ataxia telangiectasia and Rad related protein ATR, FRAP related protein, FRP, or serine/threonine protein kinase ATR. It is found in Homo sapiens and classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase in the atypical protein kinase PIKK family.

Several compounds targeting this protein are in development, including elimusertib, berzosertib, M, and ceralasertib. These are small molecule serine protein kinase ATR inhibitors in various phases of clinical trials.

The protein is involved in numerous biological processes, including DNA damage checkpoint signaling, telomere maintenance, DNA replication and repair, protein phosphorylation, and cellular responses to stress and UV radiation. It is found in cellular components such as the nucleus, chromosome telomeric regions, and Golgi apparatus.

The dataset provides information on the protein's gene ontology classifications, including its molecular functions like ATP binding and protein kinase activity, as well as its roles in biological processes such as DNA damage response and regulation of cellular stress responses.
