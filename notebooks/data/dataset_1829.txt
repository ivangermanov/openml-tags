QSAR-TID-100872 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100872. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

The molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The dataset is characterized by its large number of features, which are represented by FCFP6 molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints are used to describe the molecular structure of compounds and their interactions with biological systems.

The dataset also includes information about the drug target, which is identified as Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3. This receptor is a single-protein target that belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of smooth muscle contraction.
