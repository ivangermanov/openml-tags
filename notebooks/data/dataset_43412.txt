COVID-19 Visualisation and Epidemic Analysis Data
Tags: COVID-19 Dataset for Epidemic Model Development

I have combined several data sources to create an integrated dataset involving country-level COVID-19 confirmed, recovered, and fatalities cases, which can be used to build epidemic models such as SIR and SIR with mortality. This dataset also includes information regarding population, which can be used for calculating incidence rate and prevalence rate.

My approach is to retrieve cumulative confirmed cases, fatalities, and recovered cases since the beginning of the pandemic from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) COVID-19 dataset, merged with country code as well as population of each country. For the purpose of building epidemic models, I calculated information regarding daily new confirmed cases, recovered cases, and fatalities, together with remaining confirmed cases, which equal to cumulative confirmed cases minus cumulative recovered cases minus cumulative fatalities.

I have not yet found credible data sources regarding probable cases of various countries, but I will add them once I find them.

The dataset includes the following information:

* Date of the record
* Country or region name
* Country code for map visualization
* Population of the given country or region
* Cumulative confirmed cases
* Cumulative fatalities
* Cumulative recovered cases
* Daily new confirmed cases
* Daily new fatalities
* Daily new recovered cases
* Remaining infected cases, which equal to cumulative confirmed cases minus cumulative recovered cases minus cumulative fatalities

Acknowledgements
The data source of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths is JHU CSSE. The data source of the country-level population mainly comes from various online sources.

Inspiration
This dataset can be used for building a country-level COVID-19 case track dashboard, gaining insights regarding the incidence rate, prevalence rate, mortality, and recovery rate of various countries, and building epidemic models for forecasting.
