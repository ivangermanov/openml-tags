COVID-19 Visualisation and Epidemic Analysis Data

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This COVID-19 dataset is designed for epidemic model development, combining multiple data sources to provide an integrated dataset involving country-level COVID-19 confirmed, recovered, and fatalities cases. This comprehensive dataset enables the construction of various epidemic models, including SIR and SIR with mortality.

By incorporating information regarding population, users can calculate incidence rates and prevalence rates. A notable application based on this dataset has been published online, offering a visual representation of the data.

The approach involves retrieving cumulative confirmed cases, fatalities, and recovered cases from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) COVID-19 dataset, merging it with country codes and population data for each country. To facilitate epidemic modeling, daily new confirmed cases, recovered cases, and fatalities were calculated, along with remaining confirmed cases, which equals cumulative confirmed cases minus cumulative recovered cases minus cumulative fatalities.

Currently, credible data sources for probable cases across various countries are lacking, but they will be added once discovered.

The dataset includes the following columns:

* Date of the record
* Country or Region name
* Alpha-3 code for map visualization purposes
* Population of the given country or region
* Cumulative confirmed cases
* Cumulative fatalities
* Cumulative recovered cases
* Daily new confirmed cases
* Daily new fatalities
* Daily new recovered cases
* Remaining infected cases, calculated as cumulative confirmed cases minus cumulative recovered cases minus cumulative fatalities

Acknowledgments:
The primary data source for confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths is JHU CSSE. Country-level population data primarily originates from storage.guidotti.dev and Worldometer.

Inspiration behind creating this dataset includes developing a country-level COVID-19 case tracking dashboard, gaining insights into incidence rates, prevalence rates, mortality rates, and recovery rates across various countries, and constructing epidemic models for forecasting purposes.
