Name: Eucalyptus Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eucalyptus with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments. It uses a random number generator to uniformly sample classes from the unique values in the target variable y. If the number of unique classes exceeds nclasses max, it selects the top nclasses max classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds ncols max, it randomly selects ncols max columns and subsets the data. It then checks if the number of rows exceeds nrows max. If so, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of nrows max rows.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, including the categorical mask and column names.
