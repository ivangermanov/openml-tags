The Australian Credit Approval dataset originates from the StatLog project and concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been changed to maintain confidentiality of the data.

This dataset was retrieved from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) site and converted to the ARFF format. Major changes were made to ensure the dataset matched its description and data types.

There are six numerical and eight categorical attributes, all normalized to a range of minus one to one. The original formatting included a mix of continuous and categorical attributes, with some having multiple categories.

The dataset is interesting due to its diverse range of attributes, including continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values. Additionally, there are a few missing values present.

This file concerns credit card applications, where all attribute names and values have been changed to maintain confidentiality of the data. The dataset includes a good mix of attributes, making it suitable for various machine learning algorithms.

There are six numerical and eight categorical attributes, with labels changed for convenience. The attributes include a range of formats, such as continuous, categorical with multiple values, and binary categorical.

The dataset has missing values, which can be challenging for certain machine learning models. However, this also provides an opportunity to develop strategies for handling missing data.
