QSAR-TID-101417 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101417. It has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprint 1024 bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Demographics 

Molecule ChEMBL ID is an identifier for molecules in ChEMBL database. Median PXc Fifty is the median of pseudo-pIC50 values, which is a measure of compound potency.

Study Three 

This study aims to investigate the relationship between molecular structures and their activities on drug target TID: 101417. The study uses QSAR modeling to predict the activities of compounds based on their molecular fingerprints.

MetaQSAR Project 

The MetaQSAR project is a collaborative effort to develop and apply QSAR models for predicting compound activities on various drug targets. The project involves collecting and curating large datasets of compound structures and activities, and applying machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
