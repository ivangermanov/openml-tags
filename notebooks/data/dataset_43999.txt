Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same way. It belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset contains houses to rent with thirteen different features. Please note that some values in the dataset can be considered outliers for further analysis. It is also important to bear in mind that the web crawler was used only to gather the data, so it is possible that errors in the original data exist.

There may be differences between versions of the dataset, such as added or deleted houses, as well as added cities, since the web crawler was run on different days for each version of the dataset.

The value 'hyphen' in the attribute floor was replaced by 'zero' because, according to the data contributor, it refers to houses with just one floor.

Features include area, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, number of parking spaces, home owners association costs, rent amount, property tax, fire insurance, and total cost.
