The MiniBooNE dataset is part of the classification on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in the same way for use in machine learning and physical sciences applications. This dataset belongs to the tabular data benchmark and is originally from the MiniBooNE experiment.

The primary goal of this dataset is to differentiate between electron neutrinos, which are considered signal, and muon neutrinos, which are considered background. The dataset is ordered, with all signal observations followed by background observations.

Features include various particle identification characteristics, although these identifiers are not easily interpretable. 

The original description of this dataset was published in a research paper focusing on boosted decision trees as an alternative to artificial neural networks in classification tasks.

Keywords: machine learning, physical sciences, classification, numerical features, neutrino detection, particle physics.
