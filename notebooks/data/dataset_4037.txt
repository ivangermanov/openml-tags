QSAR-TID-11286 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11286. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Endothelin receptor ET-B, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as Ednrb, Endothelin receptor non-selective type, Endothelin receptor type B, ET-B, and ET-BR.

The Endothelin receptor ET-B is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor family. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and blood pressure regulation.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and endothelial cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis and is involved in the regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, and vasodilation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in targeting the Endothelin receptor ET-B.
