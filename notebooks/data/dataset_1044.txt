Eye Movements Dataset

Tags: grouped data, study, time series

This dataset contains eye movement data from a study on inferring relevance from eye movements. It consists of preprocessed feature vectors for words in eye movement trajectories, along with class labels. The data is organized into assignments, each containing a question followed by ten sentences (news article titles). One sentence is the correct answer, five are irrelevant, and four are relevant but do not answer the question.

The dataset structure includes columns for features, with each row representing a feature vector. Assignments are time sequences of 22-dimensional feature vectors. The first column is the line number, second is the assignment number, and columns 3-24 contain different features. Columns 25-27 provide additional information about each example. For training data, the 28th column contains the classification label: "0" for irrelevant, "1" for relevant, and "2" for the correct answer.

Each example (row) represents a single word. The task is to predict the classification of each read sentence. The 22 features provided are commonly used in psychological studies on eye movements, though not all may be relevant in this context.

Features include various eye movement metrics such as fixation counts, durations, saccade lengths, regression information, and pupil diameter measurements. Some features are specific to individual words, while others apply to entire sentences or titles.

The objective of the challenge associated with this dataset is to predict the classification labels (Irrelevant, Relevant, Correct) based on the provided eye movement features.

This dataset is valuable for research in areas such as cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, and machine learning applied to eye tracking data. It offers insights into how eye movements can be used to infer relevance and comprehension during reading tasks.
