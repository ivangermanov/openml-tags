The QSAR-TID-12202 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12202. This dataset has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The compound target in this dataset is the beta-three adrenergic receptor, also known as Adrb three, which is a single protein preferred name. It is a type of membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.

The beta-three adrenergic receptor is responsible for various biological processes, including diet-induced thermogenesis, norepinephrine-epinephrine-mediated vasodilation involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, desensitization of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway by arrestin, receptor-mediated endocytosis, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
