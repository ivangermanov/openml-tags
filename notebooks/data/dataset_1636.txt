This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-10856, falls under the categories of Economics, Life Science, and MTLQSAR. It was part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10856. There are one hundred twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty.

This dataset contains information about myosin light chain kinase, smooth muscle, which is a single protein preferred name. Its synonyms include MLCK, Mylk, myosin light chain kinase, smooth muscle, and telokin.

It belongs to the species Gallus gallus and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase MLCK family.

The description relationship accession is P one seventeen ninety-nine. 

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including stress fiber, cytoplasm, cytosol, membrane, lamellipodium, and cleavage furrow. 

In terms of function, it participates in nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, myosin light chain kinase activity, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding.

Furthermore, this protein is associated with protein phosphorylation, tonic smooth muscle contraction, and phosphorylation.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, myosin light chain kinase, smooth muscle, protein kinase activity.
