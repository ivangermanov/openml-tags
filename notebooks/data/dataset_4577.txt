Subsampling of the dataset CNAE Nine with Seed Two 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original CNAE Nine dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset.

The dataset was generated using a random number generator with a seed value of two. This ensured reproducibility of the subsampling process. The maximum number of rows, columns, and classes were limited to two thousand, one hundred, and ten, respectively.

To ensure that the subsampled dataset retained a representative distribution of classes, uniform sampling was used to select classes from the original dataset. The probability of selecting each class was proportional to its frequency in the original dataset.

Once the classes were selected, the corresponding rows were extracted from the original dataset. Then, uniform sampling was applied to select columns from the resulting dataset. The column selection process was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential characteristics.

Finally, the subsampled dataset was stratified according to the target variable to maintain the original class distribution. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using a stratified split method.
