Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratified argument determines whether the subsample should be stratified according to the target variable.

The function uses the pandas library to manipulate the data. It first selects a random subset of classes using the value counts of the target variable. It then selects a random subset of columns using the choice function from numpy random. Finally, it selects a random subset of rows using the train test split function from scikit learn.

The function returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. The new dataset has the same structure as the original, but with a reduced number of rows, columns, and classes.
