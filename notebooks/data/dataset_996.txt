Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion was originally performed by an unnamed individual.

Features: The dataset includes various chemical and physical properties of glass samples, such as refractive index, sodium content, magnesium content, aluminum content, silicon content, potassium content, calcium content, barium content, and iron content. Additionally, it includes a binary classification feature.

This dataset appears to be related to glass analysis and classification, potentially for forensic or materials science applications. The binarization of the target feature suggests it may be used for simplified classification tasks or machine learning experiments. The inclusion of chemical composition data implies that the dataset could be valuable for studying the relationship between glass composition and its properties or classification.
