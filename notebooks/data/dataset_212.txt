This dataset focuses on studying factors influencing patterns of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in children. The primary objective is to examine how various factors affect the level of serum C-peptide, aiming to gain insights into patterns of residual insulin secretion. The response measurement utilized is the logarithm of C-peptide concentration (measured in pmol/ml) at the time of diagnosis. Predictor measurements include age and base deficit, which serves as a measure of acidity.

The dataset originates from a collection of regression datasets, initially sourced from the book "Generalized Additive Models" published by Chapman & Hall. It comprises multiple cases and continuous variables, including age, deficit, and c-peptide measurements.

This dataset provides valuable information for researchers and medical professionals studying diabetes in children, offering potential insights into the relationship between various factors and insulin secretion patterns. The inclusion of both age and acidity measurements allows for a comprehensive analysis of potential influences on C-peptide levels in pediatric diabetes patients.
