Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This process transforms the continuous data into a binary classification problem, allowing for more straightforward analysis and interpretation of results. The binarization technique employed here provides a simplified representation of the original dataset while maintaining its core information and enabling the application of binary classification algorithms.

Features: The dataset includes various attributes such as survival, age, tail length, and other characteristics relevant to the study. These features provide a comprehensive set of variables for analysis and model building. The binary class feature, which is the result of the binarization process, serves as the target variable for classification tasks.
