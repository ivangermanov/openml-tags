MFEAT-Pixel Dataset

The binarized version of the original dataset has been created by converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset originally consisted of multiple classes, which were condensed into two classes for easier analysis. This conversion allows for a more straightforward approach to understanding the relationships between the features and the target variable.

Features of this dataset include various attributes, although their specific meanings have not been disclosed.
