This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset comprises various features including Surface Volume, Atomic Gain, Thermal Loss, Atomic Emission, Water Temperature, Body Height, Head Length, Face Length, Tail Thickness, and Skin Type, which have been categorized into a binary class system.
