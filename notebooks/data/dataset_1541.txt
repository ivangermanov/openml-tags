Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one twenty-four seventy-four, and it has three hundred sixty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and fingerprint features.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target one twenty-four seventy-four.

The dataset has three hundred sixty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset should be cited as MetaQSAR project - September two thousand fifteen.
