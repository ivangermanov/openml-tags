Volcanoes on Venus - JARtool Experiment Data Set 

The dataset consists of data collected by the Magellan spacecraft over a four-year period from nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety-four. The primary objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using Synthetic Aperture Radar. This mission aimed to gather comprehensive data about the planet's surface features.

There exist certain spatial dependencies within the data. For instance, background patches taken from within a single image tend to exhibit more similarity compared to those obtained from different images. Alongside these images, there are accompanying "ground truth" files that identify the locations of volcanoes within the images. It is essential to note that there is no absolute "ground truth" for this dataset, as no human expert has physically visited Venus, and the image quality does not allow for unambiguous identification of volcanoes.

The dataset includes labels that provide a measure of subjective uncertainty, with ratings ranging from one (definitely a volcano) to four (only a pit is visible), indicating varying degrees of confidence in identifying volcanic formations.

The images themselves are composed of one thousand twenty-four by one thousand twenty-four pixels, with pixel values ranging from zero to two hundred fifty-five. These pixel values correlate directly with the amount of energy reflected back to the radar from a specific spatial location. Consequently, higher pixel values signify greater backscatter, whereas lower pixel values indicate lesser backscatter. Topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength significantly impact the amount of backscatter.

Relevant publications provide further insights into the Magellan mission, its objectives, and the resulting data products.
