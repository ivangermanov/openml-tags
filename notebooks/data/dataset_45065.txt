The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. These marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required in order to assess whether the product, a bank term deposit, would be subscribed or not. The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit, which is represented by the variable "Will the Client Subscribe". 

The dataset includes various features that are used to predict the client's subscription decision. These features include the client's personal and financial information, as well as the details of the marketing campaign. 

The dataset is a valuable resource for marketers and data analysts who want to understand the factors that influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. By analyzing the relationships between the features and the subscription outcome, marketers can develop more effective marketing strategies and improve their campaign's success rate.
