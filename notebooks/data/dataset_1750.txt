QSAR-TID-11898 Dataset

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11898. It has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes molecule information, such as molecule ChEMBL ID, and fingerprint features, including FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four one, and so on, up to FCFP six one thousand twenty-four nine hundred twenty-five.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. 

Scraped Data:

The neurokinin two receptor is a single protein with a preferred name of neurokinin two receptor. It also has synonyms, including neurokinin A receptor, NK-two R, NK-two receptor, and substance-K receptor. 

The receptor belongs to the species group of Mus musculus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. 

It has various descriptions, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, tachykinin receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of acetylcholine secretion, neurotransmission. 

Expression Atlas shows one entry, while Component has five entries, including plasma membrane, membrane, sperm flagellum, sperm head, and sperm midpiece. 

Go Function has three entries, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, tachykinin receptor activity, and substance K receptor activity. 

Go Process has fourteen entries, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, tachykinin receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of acetylcholine secretion, neurotransmission, and intestine smooth muscle contraction.
