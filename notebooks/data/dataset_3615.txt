This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12832, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and various other molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September 2015.
