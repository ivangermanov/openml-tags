Cover Type Seed Three Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the Cover Type dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of three, a maximum number of rows, a maximum number of columns, a maximum number of classes, and a stratification parameter.

The original Cover Type dataset was uniformly sampled to select a subset of classes, ensuring that each class had an equal probability of being chosen. This resulted in a reduced number of classes, which were then used to filter the data and select the relevant instances.

Next, the dataset was uniformly sampled again to select a subset of columns, ensuring that each column had an equal probability of being chosen. This resulted in a reduced number of columns, which were then used to create the final dataset.

If the dataset still had more instances than desired, it was further stratified to ensure that each class was proportionally represented in the final dataset.

The resulting dataset has undergone significant transformations to reduce its size while preserving its essential characteristics.
