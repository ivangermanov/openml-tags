The QSAR-TID-100947 dataset is a collection of QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Two. This dataset contains nine hundred forty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature called Median PXc50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It shows activity values of several compounds on the drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Two, also known as B Lymphocyte Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase, GC Kinase, Germinal Center Kinase, MAP Four K Two.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase Two is an enzyme that belongs to the STE protein kinase family, specifically the STE protein kinase KHS subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including immune system process, protein phosphorylation, vesicle targeting, immune response, JNK cascade, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, positive regulation of JUN kinase activity, innate immune response, and positive regulation of JNK cascade.

This enzyme is located in the Golgi membrane, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, membrane, and basolateral plasma membrane. It has nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase activity, kinase activity, transferase activity, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase binding functions.
