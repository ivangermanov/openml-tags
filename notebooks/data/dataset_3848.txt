QSAR-TID-11929 Dataset Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11929, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was derived from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when used.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features, and Median PXc50.
