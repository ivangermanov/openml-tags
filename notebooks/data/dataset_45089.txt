Gliomas dataset, also known as GLI, is a microarray dataset that strongly predicts survival. This dataset is a gene expression profiling of gliomas, which is a type of brain tumor. The dataset is composed of a large number of features, including gene expressions, that are used to predict the survival rate of patients with gliomas.

The dataset is a result of a study published in Cancer Research, a renowned scientific journal, and is widely cited in the scientific community. The study aimed to identify genes that are associated with glioma survival and to develop a gene expression profile that can predict patient outcomes.

The dataset contains a large number of features, including gene expressions, that are used to predict the survival rate of patients with gliomas. These features are the result of a microarray analysis, which is a high-throughput technology used to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously.

Keywords: gliomas, microarray, gene expression, survival prediction, brain tumor.
