Dataset Title: Wall Following Robot Navigation Data Set 

Abstract: 
The data was collected while the SCITOS G5 robot navigated through the room following the wall in a clockwise direction, for four rounds, using twenty-four ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its waist.

Data Set Information: 
The provided file contains the raw values of the measurements of all twenty-four ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label. Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of nine samples per second. It is worth mentioning that the twenty-four ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows, one for each sampling time step. 

The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a nonlinearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the Multilayer Perceptron network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. If some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot successfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the Multilayer Perceptron network.

Attribute Information: 
There are five attributes in total, including the class attribute. These attributes are described below:

Front Distance: minimum sensor reading within a sixty-degree arc located at the front of the robot.
Left Distance: minimum sensor reading within a sixty-degree arc located at the left of the robot.
Right Distance: minimum sensor reading within a sixty-degree arc located at the right of the robot.
Back Distance: minimum sensor reading within a sixty-degree arc located at the back of the robot.
Class: This attribute represents the action that the robot should take, which can be one of the following: Move Forward, Slight Right Turn, Sharp Right Turn, Slight Left Turn.
