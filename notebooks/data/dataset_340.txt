The purpose of this research was to determine the changes occurring in squash fruit during maturation and ripening to identify the optimal time for achieving the best quality in the Japanese marketplace. The squash is transported to Japan via refrigerated cargo vessels, taking three to four weeks to reach the market. Evaluations were conducted at two stages: first, representing the quality inspection stage prior to export, and second, simulating the condition upon arrival at the marketplace.

The original objectives aimed to determine which pre-harvest variables contribute to good-tasting squash after various storage periods. This is assessed by categorizing each squash as either unacceptable, acceptable, or excellent based on a measure of acceptability. The fruit in this dataset were stored before measurement, and they possess an additional attribute that the squash-unstored dataset lacks - the weight of the fruit after storage.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes various attributes such as the site where the fruit is located, days after flowering, individual fruit number, weight of whole fruit in grams, weight after storage, penetrometer readings indicating maturity at harvest, solids percentage, brix measurement for sweetness or ripeness, color measurements, heat accumulation data, ground spot color, sugar content (glucose, fructose, sucrose), total sugar, starch content, and taste panel scores for sweetness, flavor, moisture, and fiber.

Additional attributes include heat input after emergence and before flowering, as well as the overall acceptability of the fruit.

This comprehensive dataset allows for in-depth analysis of factors affecting squash quality and storage performance, providing valuable insights for optimizing harvest timing and storage conditions to meet market demands.
