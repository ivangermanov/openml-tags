Forest Fires Data Set Portugal

Abstract
This is a challenging regression task, where the goal is to predict the burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal, using meteorological and other data. 

Data Set Information
The data set has multiple variables and five hundred seventeen instances. The area of study is physical, and the attributes are real numbers. There are thirteen attributes in total. 

Data Set Characteristics
The data set is multivariate, and there are no missing values. 

Associated Tasks
The associated task is regression. 

In a previous study, the output 'area' was first transformed with a natural logarithm function. Then, several data mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the natural logarithm transform. Four different input setups were used. The experiments were conducted using a ten-fold cross-validation method, repeated thirty times. Two regression metrics were measured: mean absolute difference and root mean squared error. 

A Gaussian support vector machine fed with only four direct weather conditions obtained the best mean absolute difference value. The best root mean squared error was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis of the regression error curve shows that the support vector machine model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect, the support vector machine model predicts better small fires, which are the majority.
