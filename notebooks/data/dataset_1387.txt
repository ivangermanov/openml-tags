QSAR-TID-101584 Dataset: Demographics, Economics, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101584. It has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101584.
