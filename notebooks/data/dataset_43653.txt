NBA Players 2016-2019 Tags: Context

This dataset was created for a university project in Milan, with the goal of developing a robust model to predict the All-Star Game score for each player. The score is calculated by dividing the players by conference and position held in the field, whether external or internal, and ranking them in descending order based on the number of votes received for each category of voter. This results in three different rankings, from which an average is calculated with a weighted score, giving 0.50 weight to fan votes and 0.25 to the two remaining.

To accomplish this, we merged datasets from Kaggle, Basketball-Reference.com, and Hoopshype.com. However, we did not use all the variables, and due to the problem of independent observations, we only took the last season's observation for each player. Other analyses could be performed using salary as a target, as well as cluster analysis for players or principal component analysis.

The dataset includes variables such as main position, games played, games started, minutes played, field goals per game, field goal attempts per game, field goal percentage, three-point field goals per game, three-point field goal attempts per game, and so on.

Features: Player, Player ID, Age, Team, Games Played, Games Started, Minutes Played, Field Goals, Field Goal Attempts, Field Goal Percentage, and others.

Keywords: NBA, All-Star Game, player performance, predictive model, basketball statistics.
