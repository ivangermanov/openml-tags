Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled oz1 through oz50, along with a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been transformed into a binary classification task. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean threshold. Instances with target values below the mean were classified as positive ('P'), while those above or equal to the mean were classified as negative ('N').

The dataset is associated with various studies and a mythbusting project, suggesting its potential use in evaluating hypotheses or challenging common assumptions in a particular domain. The exact nature of the data and its specific application remain undisclosed, but its structure indicates it may be suitable for binary classification tasks and machine learning experiments.

Researchers utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation and refer to the original version for additional context or information not provided in this binarized adaptation.
