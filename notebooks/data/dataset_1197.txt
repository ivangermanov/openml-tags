This dataset, known as BNG (Two Dimensional Planes), is an artificial dataset used for various analytical purposes. It is characterized by its two-dimensional nature, focusing on planes within a coordinate system. The dataset includes multiple x-axis features, denoted as x through x, along with a corresponding y-axis feature. This structure allows for comprehensive analysis of relationships and patterns within a two-dimensional space. The artificial nature of the dataset makes it particularly useful for controlled studies and algorithm testing in fields such as machine learning and data science.
