The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Evidence of local transmission of the disease has been found in many countries across all six World Health Organization regions.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China, in the year two thousand and nineteen. This is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans, and has since spread globally, resulting in the coronavirus pandemic.

The coronavirus pandemic has spread rapidly around the world, affecting many countries and causing widespread illness and death. The rapid spread of the virus has been facilitated by modern transportation networks and the interconnectedness of the modern world. As a result, the coronavirus pandemic has become a major global health crisis, requiring a coordinated international response to combat its spread and mitigate its impact.
