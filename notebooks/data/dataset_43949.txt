The RL dataset is part of the Tabular Data Benchmark, specifically designed for classification on categorical and numerical features. It has undergone transformation to conform to the benchmark standards.

The primary objective of this challenge is to introduce the research community to real-world datasets of significant interest, formatted uniformly despite differences in data types. Participants receive preprocessed matrices, allowing them to focus solely on classification, although additional feature extraction methods are permitted as long as they comply with the rules.

All problems presented are binary classification challenges, assessed using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) metric. The identities of the datasets and their respective data types remain concealed, while their structures are disclosed.

The ultimate score will be calculated as the average of rankings across all testing datasets, generating a comprehensive ranking to determine the winners. Time constraints apply to each task, executed within a shared computational environment provided by the Codalab platform.

Each code submission is executed within a compute worker featuring two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, forty gigabytes of solid-state drive storage, and an Ubuntu operating system. Execution time is limited to ensure fair evaluation.
