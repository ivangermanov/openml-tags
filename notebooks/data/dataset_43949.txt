The RL dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark, transformed in a uniform way to facilitate classification on categorical and numerical features. The original dataset belongs to a real-world challenge, where the goal is to expose the research community to datasets of interest, formatted in a uniform way to focus on classification. 

The data are provided as preprocessed matrices, allowing participants to focus on classification, although additional feature extraction procedures are welcome as long as they do not violate any rules of the challenge. All problems are binary classification problems, assessed with the normalized Area Under the ROC Curve metric. 

The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, although its structure is revealed. The final score will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets, generating a ranking to determine the winners. The tasks are constrained by a time budget, and the Codalab platform provides computational resources shared by all participants. 

Each code submission will be executed in a compute worker with specific characteristics, ensuring the fairness of the evaluation. When a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited to ensure fairness.

Keywords: tabular data, classification, categorical features, numerical features, binary classification, Area Under the ROC Curve, computational resources, time budget.
