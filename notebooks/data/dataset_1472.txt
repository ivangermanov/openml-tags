Energy-efficiency (study)

Please cite: The dataset was created by a Civil/Structural Engineer and processed by a researcher at the Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK.

Data Set Information:
Energy analysis was performed using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings vary with respect to glazing area, glazing area distribution, orientation, and other parameters. Various settings were simulated as functions of the aforementioned characteristics to obtain building shapes. The dataset comprises samples and features, aiming to predict two real-valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

Attribute Information:
The dataset contains eight attributes (or features) and two responses (or outcomes). The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. Specifically:

Relative Compactness
Surface Area
Wall Area
Roof Area
Overall Height
Orientation
Glazing Area
Glazing Area Distribution

The two responses are:
Heating Load
Cooling Load

The dataset was created to analyze energy efficiency in buildings based on various architectural features. It provides a comprehensive set of attributes that can be used to predict heating and cooling loads, which are crucial factors in determining a building's energy consumption. This information can be valuable for architects, engineers, and policymakers in designing and evaluating energy-efficient buildings.
