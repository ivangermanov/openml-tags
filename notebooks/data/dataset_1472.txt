Energy Efficiency Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Study

This dataset was created to analyze the energy efficiency of twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings vary in terms of their glazing area, glazing area distribution, and orientation, among other parameters. By simulating various settings based on these characteristics, we obtained seven hundred sixty-eight building shapes.

The dataset consists of seven hundred sixty-eight samples and eight features, aimed at predicting two real-valued responses. Additionally, it can be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

The dataset contains eight attributes, denoted by features, and two responses, denoted by outcomes. The goal is to utilize the eight features to predict each of the two outcomes. Specifically, the features include relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. These features are used to predict heating load and cooling load responses.
