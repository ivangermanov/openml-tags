Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Bank Marketing with seed equals one, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification. It returns a dataset. The random number generator is set with the given seed. The input data and target values are stored in x and y respectively. The unique classes in the target values are found. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, a subset of classes is selected using the random number generator, with the probability of each class being selected proportional to its frequency in the data. The indices where one of these classes is present are found, and the input data and target values are filtered accordingly. If the number of columns in the input data is greater than the maximum number of columns, a subset of columns is selected using the random number generator. The input data is filtered to include only the selected columns. If the number of rows in the filtered input data is greater than the maximum number of rows, the data is split into a subset of the given size using stratified sampling. The categorical columns are converted to string format. The dataset is returned with the filtered input data, target values, categorical mask, and column names.
