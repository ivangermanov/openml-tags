QSAR-TID-101348 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101348. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101348. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PRKX, which is a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.

The Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PRKX is a single protein that is involved in multiple biological processes, including angiogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation, protein phosphorylation, and cell adhesion. It is also involved in the regulation of cell migration, cell differentiation, and epithelial tube morphogenesis.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PRKX. It can be used to identify potential compounds that can modulate the activity of this protein kinase, and to understand the underlying mechanisms of its biological functions.
