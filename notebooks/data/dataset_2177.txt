The QSAR-TID-11239 dataset, tagged as MTLQSAR and study_3, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11239. This dataset has seventy rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The drug target TID: 11239 is also known as cystinyl aminopeptidase, insulin-regulated membrane aminopeptidase, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase, IRAP, leucyl-cystinyl aminopeptidase, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, and metallo protease MAE clan.

This protein target is involved in various biological processes, including protein polyubiquitination, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I, proteolysis, signal transduction, cell-cell signaling, female pregnancy, regulation of blood pressure, protein catabolic process, and peptide catabolic process.

Keywords: QSAR, cystinyl aminopeptidase, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR, biological processes, proteolysis, signal transduction, protein catabolic process.
