The Cookbook Reviews dataset is an extensive collection of information that encompasses a wide range of user interactions and recipe reviews. This comprehensive dataset contains crucial details such as the recipe name, its ranking within the top one hundred recipes, and a unique recipe code. Furthermore, it also includes user information comprising the user identification, username, and internal reputation rate.

Each review comment is accompanied by a distinct comment identification, along with various attributes including the creation timestamp, response count, and the total number of upvotes and downvotes received. Users' opinions of recipes are evaluated using a five-star rating system, where zero represents no rating at all.

Features include recipe number, recipe code, recipe name, comment identification, user identification, username, user reputation, timestamp, response number, upvotes, downvotes, ratings, maximum rating, and comment.
