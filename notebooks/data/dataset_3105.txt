QSAR-TID Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Histamine H receptor, also known as HR, HHR, and Hrh. This receptor is a single protein target found in Rattus norvegicus. It belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor subgroup of monoamine receptors.

The Histamine H receptor is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of neurotransmitter levels, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, learning, memory, and eating behavior. It plays a role in regulating blood pressure, epithelial cell proliferation, and responses to organic cyclic compounds.

This receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane, dendrites, and synapses. Its functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, histamine receptor activity, and amine binding. The receptor is associated with several Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes, highlighting its importance in various cellular and physiological activities.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, which can aid in drug discovery and development targeting the Histamine H receptor. This data can be used to predict the activity of novel compounds and understand the structural features that influence receptor binding and activation.
