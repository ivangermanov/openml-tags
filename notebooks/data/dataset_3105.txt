MetaQSAR Project - Dataset Information

The QSAR-TID-11300 dataset, tagged with Machine Learning and MTLQSAR, is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Histamine H3 Receptor.

The dataset consists of 1616 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and a class feature, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is particularly useful for machine learning models, as it provides a large number of instances and features to train and test predictive models. The Histamine H3 Receptor is a single protein target, also known as H3R, HH3R, and Histamine H3 Receptor Hrh3, belonging to the species group Rattus norvegicus.

The target classification is 1. Membrane Receptor / Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor / Small Molecule Receptor (Family A GPCR) / Monoamine Receptor / Histamine Receptor. The description relationship accession is Histamine H3 Receptor SINGLE PROTEIN Q9QYN8.

The dataset also includes information about the Gene Ontology (GO) components, functions, and processes associated with the Histamine H3 Receptor. These include plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, synapse, G protein-coupled receptor activity, histamine receptor activity, amine binding, and heterocyclic compound binding.

Furthermore, the dataset provides information about the biological processes related to the Histamine H3 Receptor, such as regulation of neurotransmitter levels, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, negative regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.
