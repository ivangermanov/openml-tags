Tags: Computational Universe, Computer Systems, Finance, Forex, Forex Day, Forex High

This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex GBP/USD from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute represents the direction of the mean high price of the following day relative to the mean high price of the current day. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is expected to increase the following day, and false when the mean high price is expected to decrease or remain unchanged.

Please note that this is a hypothetical task intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trading strategies should only be applied to predictions based on close attributes, which are also available in the dataset.

The dataset consists of the following attributes:

* Timestamp: The time of the current data point in the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.
* Bid Open: The bid price at the start of the time interval.
* Bid High: The highest bid price during the time interval.
