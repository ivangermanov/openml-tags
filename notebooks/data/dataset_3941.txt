QSAR-TID-10578 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10578. It has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values in unit of pseudo-pCI50.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.
