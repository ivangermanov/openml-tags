The Ecoli Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

Features included in this dataset are molecular characteristics such as membrane composition and amino acid properties.
