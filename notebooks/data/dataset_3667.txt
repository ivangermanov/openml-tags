The QSAR-TID-10964 dataset, tagged with Meteorology, MTLQSAR, and study_3, contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values in terms of pseudo-pCI50 of various compounds on drug target TID one thousand ninety-six four. This dataset comprises one hundred sixty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature, namely, MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated. 

This dataset describes prolyl endopeptidase, a single protein also known as post-proline cleaving enzyme, PREP, and prolyl endopeptidase. It belongs to the species group Sus scrofa and is classified under the category of enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease SC clan/serine protease S nine A subfamily.

The dataset provides information on the protein target classification, description, relationship, accession, and preferred name. Additionally, it offers details on Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes, as well as canSAR-target, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe information.

Keywords: QSAR, ChEMBL, drug target, molecular fingerprints, prolyl endopeptidase, serine protease, Gene Ontology, protein target classification.
