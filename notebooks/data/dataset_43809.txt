GDP per Capita All Countries

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country during a specific period. It provides an economic snapshot of a country, used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate. This dataset contains the GDP based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which is a more accurate measure of a nation's domestic market. PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services, and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income.

This dataset is particularly useful when assessing a nation's domestic market, as it provides a more accurate picture of the standard of living and economic well-being of its citizens. By using PPP, the dataset helps to eliminate distortions caused by exchange rates, allowing for more meaningful comparisons between countries.
