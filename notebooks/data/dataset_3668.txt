QSAR-TID-100071 Dataset: A Comprehensive Collection of QSAR Data for Drug Target TID 100071

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 100071. It consists of ninety rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, providing valuable information for researchers studying the structure-activity relationships of compounds interacting with this specific drug target.

TID 100071 corresponds to the single protein Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PAK Two, also known as C-t-PAK Two, Gamma-PAK, p Twenty-One Activated Kinase Two, p Twenty-Seven, and p Thirty-Four. This enzyme belongs to the STE protein kinase group, STE Twenty family, and STE protein kinase PAK A subfamily.

The protein is primarily located in the nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, cell-cell junction, postsynaptic density, membrane, secretory granule, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including nucleotide binding, catalytic activity, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein kinase binding, small GTPase binding, identical protein binding, cadherin binding, and protein serine kinase activity.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PAK Two, molecular fingerprints, structure-activity relationships, enzyme, protein kinase activity.
