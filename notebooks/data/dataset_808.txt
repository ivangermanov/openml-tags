Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean, respectively. Positive instances are denoted by 'P', while negative instances are marked as 'N'. This binarization allows for a simplified two-class classification problem.

The dataset includes several features, each labeled as "oz" followed by a number, suggesting they may represent different measurements or attributes. The final feature is labeled as "binary Class", which likely corresponds to the binarized target variable resulting from the aforementioned conversion process.

It is important to note that the original source and date of this dataset are unknown, emphasizing the need for proper citation when using this binarized version in research or analysis. The dataset appears to be associated with various studies and a mythbusting theme, as indicated by the tags.
