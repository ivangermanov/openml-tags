**Machine Learning, Manufacturing, MTLQSAR Study**

This dataset, named QSAR-TID-20139, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20139. It consists of one hundred eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
