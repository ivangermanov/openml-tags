The 2020 Pokémon Dataset
Tags: Life Science, Medicine

I embarked on a fascinating journey in the realm of data science, starting with basic data visualization techniques. During my search for suitable datasets online, I stumbled upon a Pokémon dataset that immediately caught my attention. As an avid fan of the Pokémon franchise since childhood, having played every main series game, I was thrilled to begin my data visualization endeavors with a dataset that resonated with my passion.

However, upon delving deeper into the analysis, I discovered that the existing dataset had several missing values and only featured information on Pokémon from the first seven generations. Given the age of the dataset, this limitation was somewhat anticipated, especially considering the latest generation was introduced recently. I felt compelled to update the data to ensure its relevance and comprehensiveness.

Fortunately, my proficiency in web scraping enabled me to tackle this challenge head-on. I extracted data from reputable sources, including PokémonDB.net and Bulbapedia, over the course of two days. Developing the scraping logic, debugging, and refining the code required meticulous effort, particularly when dealing with complex scenarios like iterating through a single page multiple times and accessing data hidden behind buttons. Once the file was generated, I manually reviewed and corrected any names containing unsupported symbols and rearranged the columns for optimal organization.

This enriched dataset encompasses a wide range of attributes, including Pokémon names, Pokédex numbers, generations, abilities, physical statistics such as height and weight, typing, defense multipliers against various types, and more. Notably, it incorporates data on all Mega Evolutions, Galarian, Alolan, and alternate forms, bringing the total count to an impressive array of Pokémon. To facilitate filtering and analysis, I added columns indicating whether a Pokémon is legendary, mythical, or a Mega Evolution.
