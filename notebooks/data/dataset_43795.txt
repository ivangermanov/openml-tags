The 2020 Pokémon Dataset

Tags: Context

As I embarked on my data science journey, I began by exploring basic data visualizations. During my search for datasets online, I stumbled upon a Pokémon dataset, which was a delightful surprise, given my lifelong fascination with the franchise. Having played every main series game since I was three, I was thrilled to start my data visualization work with a dataset that held sentimental value. However, upon analyzing the data, I discovered that it contained missing values and only included information on the first seven generations of Pokémon. This was somewhat expected, considering the dataset was three years old, and the latest generation had been revealed recently.

I realized that it was time to update this data, and with my knowledge of web scraping, I was well-equipped to take on the task. I scraped the data from PokémonDB.net and Bulbapedia, which took two days of creating logic, debugging, and perfecting the code. This involved iterating through a single page multiple times and accessing data that was only visible when a button was pressed. Most of my time was spent creating this logic. Once the file was generated, I manually checked and changed some names with unsupported symbols and arranged the columns.

This dataset contains a comprehensive range of information, including Pokémon names, Pokédex numbers, generations, abilities, physical stats such as height and weight, typing, and defense multipliers against each type. Notably, this data encompasses not only the eight hundred and ninety Pokémon but also their mega evolutions, Galarian, Alolan, and alternate forms. I have also added columns for legendary, mythical, and mega status, allowing users to filter out these Pokémon using queries if needed.
