Short Track Speed Skating Database for Sports Data Analysis

This database covers all international short track games over the past five years, currently featuring only men's 500m events. It includes detailed lap data, comprising personal time and ranking in each game, from seasons 2012/2013 to present. The database also contains final time results, ranking, starting position, and qualified or penalized information for each athlete in each game. All series of World Cup, World Championship, European Championship, and Olympic Games are included.

The data is collected from the International Skating Union's official website and has undergone a thorough cleaning procedure. Please ensure that the data is used only for personal and non-commercial purposes.

Exploring the data may lead to interesting insights, such as:

* What happens in a game when there are multiple athletes from the same team? Do their performances improve collectively?
* How do athletes' performances change within a season and over multiple seasons?
* Do certain athletes exhibit special patterns in terms of time allocation and surpassing opportunities?
* What impact did the implementation of the "no toe starts" rule have on athletes since July 2015?
* Is there a home advantage in short track speed skating, similar to other sports?
