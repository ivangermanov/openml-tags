This dataset, named Rosowsky, is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset is derived from various original studies on topics including carbolenes, melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro- and bromo-alkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, protein engineering, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The studies utilized various methodologies including Hansch analysis, weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors, linear and non-linear models, regression models, mechanistic approaches, multivariate pattern recognition, and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR).

The research spans multiple areas of medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and drug design, focusing on predicting and interpreting biological activity, toxicity, biodegradability, and physicochemical properties of diverse chemical compounds.
