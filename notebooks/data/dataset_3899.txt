QSAR-TID-10618 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10618. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10618. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Serotonin one e receptor, which is a protein target classified as a membrane receptor and a G protein-coupled receptor.

The Serotonin one e receptor is a single protein target that is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission. It is also associated with several Gene Ontology terms, including plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, and synapse.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery, particularly those focused on the Serotonin one e receptor.
