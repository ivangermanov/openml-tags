**QSAR-TID-10618**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10618, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, numerous fingerprint features, and median px fifty.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
