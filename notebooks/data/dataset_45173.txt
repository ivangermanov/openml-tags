This Bayesian network is a representation of a water treatment system, comprising thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs. The network has a total of ten thousand and eighty-three parameters, with an average Markov blanket size of approximately seven point six nine and an average degree of four point one two. The maximum in-degree of the network is five.

The Water Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model of a waste water treatment system, designed to facilitate the management and control of the treatment process. The network incorporates a range of variables and factors that influence the treatment process, including chemical and biological parameters.
