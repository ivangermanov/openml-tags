Child Bayesian Network. Sample Nine.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this dataset, which is a comprehensive collection of data related to the Child domain. This dataset has twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with two hundred thirty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is three, and the average degree is two point five. The maximum in-degree is two.

This Child Bayesian Network is a representation of the relationships between various factors affecting a child's health. It is a discrete medium-sized network that aims to model the complex interactions between different variables. 

The Child Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on machine learning and life science projects. It provides a rich set of data that can be used to build and test probabilistic models.
