COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Dataset
Tags: Context and Content

The COVID-19 case surveillance system database includes individual-level data reported to US states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia, as well as US territories and states. COVID-19 was added to the Nationally Notifiable Condition List and classified as immediately notifiable, urgent, by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists Interim Position Statement. This statement was updated to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification, and recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and shared voluntarily with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The deidentified data in the public use dataset include demographic characteristics, exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities. All data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form.
