The okcupid-stem dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of arguments to generate a new dataset with particular characteristics. This new dataset has been generated with a seed value, which ensures reproducibility of the sampling process.

The resulting dataset contains a maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, with the option to stratify the sampling process based on the target variable. The original dataset had over forty-two thousand samples, but this subsampled version has been reduced to a more manageable size while maintaining the diversity of the original dataset.

The sampling process involved selecting a uniform distribution of classes, followed by a uniform selection of columns and finally, a selection of samples while ensuring that the target variable is stratified. This approach helps maintain the balance of the dataset and prevents any particular class or feature from dominating the analysis.

The dataset includes a range of features related to demographics, lifestyle, and personal preferences. These features include age, body type, dietary preferences, drinking habits, use of drugs, educational background, ethnicity, height, income level, location, family status, sexual orientation, pet ownership, religious beliefs, gender, astrological sign, smoking habits, language proficiency, and relationship status.
