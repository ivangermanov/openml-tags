**Link Bayesian Network. Sample 0.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online. This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, while the average degree is moderate. The maximum in-degree is also moderate.

This network is a discrete-verylarge Bayesian network, with a large number of nodes and arcs. The number of parameters is substantial, indicating a complex network structure. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, suggesting that each node has a limited number of parents. The average degree is moderate, indicating that each node has a moderate number of connections to other nodes. The maximum in-degree is also moderate, indicating that some nodes have a relatively large number of parents.
