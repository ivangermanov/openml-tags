The QSAR-TID-10452 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10452. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains information about Cruzipain, also known as Cruzaine or Cruzipain Major cysteine proteinase, which is an enzyme belonging to the cysteine protease CA clan and cysteine protease C one A family. It is found in the species Trypanosoma cruzi and plays a role in proteolysis.

Cruzipain is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, and has functions such as cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It is classified under the Gene Ontology categories of enzyme, protease, cysteine protease, cysteine protease CA clan, and cysteine protease C one A family.

Keywords: QSAR, Cruzipain, cysteine protease, proteolysis, enzyme, Trypanosoma cruzi.
