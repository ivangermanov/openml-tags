QSAR-TID-10452 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10452. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cruzipain, a single protein preferred name, also known as Cruzaine or Cruzipain Major cysteine proteinase. Cruzipain is an enzyme, a protease, a cysteine protease, belonging to the cysteine protease CA clan and cysteine protease C1A family.

Cruzipain is an organism from Trypanosoma cruzi, a species group, and is classified as an enzyme, a protease, a cysteine protease, belonging to the cysteine protease CA clan and cysteine protease C1A family. Cruzipain has multiple functions, including cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It is involved in the process of proteolysis.

Cruzipain has multiple relationships, including accession P25779, and is classified by multiple databases, including canSAR-Target, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
