This Bayesian network has a total of two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, with a large number of parameters totaling one thousand one hundred fifty-seven. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, and the average degree is three point zero three. The maximum in-degree is six.

The Andes Bayesian network is a complex model that represents a large-scale probabilistic network. It is a discrete-very large network, with a significant number of nodes and arcs, making it a challenging model to work with.

The network has a wide range of features, including nodes and arcs that represent various concepts and relationships. Some of the features that can be identified include goal-oriented nodes, resolve nodes, choose nodes, identify nodes, and many others.
