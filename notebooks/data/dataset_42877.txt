The SCADI dataset contains two hundred and six attributes of seventy children with physical and motor disability based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY). This dataset is the only one that has been used by machine learning researchers for self-care problems classification based on ICF-CY to date. The 'Class' field refers to the presence of self-care problems of the children with physical and motor disabilities, which are determined by occupational therapists. The names and social security numbers of the children were recently removed from the dataset. Two files have been processed, SCADI.arff for using in WEKA and SCADI.CSV for using in MATLAB and similar tools.
