**Multiple Features Dataset: Factors**

This dataset is one of a set of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (zero to nine) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character.

The dataset consists of two thousand instances, two hundred instances per class, which were digitized in binary images.

### Attribute Information

The attributes represent profile correlations. Unfortunately, no more information is known about these attributes.

### Relevant Papers

A slightly different version of this database was used in a paper titled "Handwritten Digit Recognition by Combined Classifiers". The current database was also used in a review paper titled "Statistical Pattern Recognition: A Review".

This dataset contains features representing profile correlations. There are six files in total, each containing different types of features. These include Fourier coefficients of the character shapes, profile correlations, Karhunen-Love coefficients, pixel averages in two by three windows, Zernike moments, and morphological features. 

In each file, the two thousand patterns are stored in ASCII on two thousand lines. The first two hundred patterns are of class zero, followed by sets of two hundred patterns for each of the classes one to nine. 

Corresponding patterns in different feature sets correspond to the same original character. Unfortunately, the source image dataset has been lost. However, using the pixel dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained, with a resolution of fifteen by sixteen pixels.

Has Missing Values? No

Additional Variable Information: Six files are included in this dataset, each containing a different type of feature.
