Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Patient, Time, Status, Age, Sex, Disease Type, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on kidney-related medical information and has been processed to create a binary classification. The original numeric data has been transformed into two distinct categories based on the mean value, allowing for simplified analysis and comparison. This binarization process aids in mythbusting and various study applications by providing a clear positive or negative classification for each instance. The dataset includes important medical and demographic information about patients, potentially enabling researchers to investigate correlations between various factors and kidney-related outcomes.
