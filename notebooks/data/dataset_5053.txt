**Munin Bayesian Network**

This network is a massive discrete Bayesian network repository reference, consisting of a large number of nodes and arcs. It has been designed to model complex relationships between various variables.

The Munin Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model that incorporates a wide range of features related to astronomy, earth science, and other fields. These features include aspects such as muscle activity, electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and muscle denervation.

The network structure is characterized by a large number of nodes, representing different variables, and arcs, which signify the probabilistic dependencies between these variables. The average Markov blanket size and average degree provide insights into the complexity of the relationships modeled by this network.

This Bayesian network has numerous applications in areas such as medical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. It can be used to identify patterns and relationships between different variables, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.
