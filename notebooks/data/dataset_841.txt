Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion allows for binary classification analysis of the stock data.

The dataset contains information about various companies and their stock performance. It includes features related to multiple companies, which are likely financial or market indicators. The binary classification feature enables researchers and analysts to study stock trends and make predictions based on the positive or negative categorization.

This binarized version of the dataset provides a simplified approach to analyzing complex stock market data, making it useful for machine learning applications and statistical studies in finance and economics. Researchers can use this dataset to develop and test predictive models for stock performance or to investigate patterns in market behavior.

Features: The dataset includes information about multiple companies, labeled as company one through company nine, along with the binary classification feature.
