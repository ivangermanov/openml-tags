Stock Dataset: A Binarized Regression Problem for Chemistry and Life Science Studies 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes several features related to companies, including company information and characteristics.
