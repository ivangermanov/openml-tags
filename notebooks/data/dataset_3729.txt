QSAR-TID-17063 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17063. It has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset shows activity values, unit is pseudo-pCI fifty, of several compounds on drug target TID: one seven thousand sixty-three. It has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.
