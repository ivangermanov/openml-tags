QSAR-TID-17063 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurotensin Receptor One, and it has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurotensin Receptor One. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The Neurotensin Receptor One is a protein target that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is involved in various physiological processes, including temperature homeostasis, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, and modulation of pain perception.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Neurotensin Receptor One. The models can be used to predict the activity of new compounds and to identify potential leads for drug development.
