Click Prediction Small Seed Four N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

This dataset is a subsampling of the Click Prediction Small dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of four, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. The stratification option was set to true.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the target variable were identified, and then a random selection of ten classes was made using a probability proportional to their frequency in the dataset. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to subset the data.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to select a maximum of one hundred columns. This was done by generating a random permutation of the column indices and selecting the first one hundred elements of this permutation.

Finally, the dataset was further subsampled to reduce its size to a maximum of two thousand rows. This was done using stratified sampling, which ensures that the class distribution is preserved in the subsampled dataset.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, including impression, URL, ad ID, advertiser ID, depth, position, query ID, keyword ID, title ID, description ID, and user ID.
