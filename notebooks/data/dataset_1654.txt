The QSAR-TID-10970 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10970. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program. These molecular fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It contains data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10970.

The preferred name for this target is CaM kinase I alpha, also known as Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type one. This enzyme belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group and CAMK one family.

This enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, nucleocytoplasmic transport, cell cycle, signal transduction, nervous system development, metabolic process, positive regulation of neuron projection development, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, cell differentiation, negative regulation of protein binding, regulation of protein localization, regulation of protein binding, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, positive regulation of protein export from nucleus, regulation of muscle cell differentiation, positive regulation of muscle cell differentiation, positive regulation of synapse structural plasticity, positive regulation of syncytium formation by plasma membrane fusion, and positive regulation of dendritic spine development.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, CaM kinase I alpha, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, nervous system development, metabolic process.
