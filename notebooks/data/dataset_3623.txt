Violent Crime by Counties in Maryland 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning Context 

Crime rates vary significantly across space and time. The reasons crimes are committed in certain areas but not others can be extremely difficult to detect due to intricate socio-economic factors, but policymakers still need to comprehend how crime rates are changing from place to place and from time to time to inform their policies effectively. Many government statistics, such as crime rates, originate from nested datasets. Most United States states are divided into counties (except for Alaska which has boroughs, and Louisiana which has parishes), and counties and county-level governments can exhibit considerable variation within the same state. For instance, one county may possess a high population density and be predominantly urban, whereas another county may have a low population density and be largely rural.
