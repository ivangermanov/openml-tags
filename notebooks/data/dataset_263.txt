This dermatological condition presents with erythema, scaling, and definite borders, accompanied by intense itching. The Koebner phenomenon is also observed, characterized by polygonal papules and follicular papules. Additionally, oral mucosal involvement is present, along with knee and elbow involvement, and scalp involvement. A significant family history is noted.

Histopathological examination reveals melanin incontinence, eosinophils in the infiltrate, and a PNL infiltrate. Fibrosis of the papillary dermis is evident, along with exocytosis, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis. Clubbing of the rete ridges and elongation of the rete ridges are also observed. Thinning of the suprapapillary epidermis is noted, accompanied by spongiform pustules and Munro microabscesses.

Focal hypergranulosis is present, with disappearance of the granular layer. Vacuolization and damage of the basal layer are evident, along with spongiosis and a saw-tooth appearance of the rete ridges. Follicular horn plugs are observed, along with perifollicular parakeratosis. An inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate is present, with a band-like infiltrate.
