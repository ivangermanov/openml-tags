QSAR-TID-17052 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17052. The dataset has fifty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17052. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is related to the beta-two adrenergic receptor, which is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including heart rate regulation, smooth muscle contraction, and neurotransmission. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is activated by the binding of epinephrine and norepinephrine.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization. The molecular fingerprints provided in the dataset can be used as input features for machine learning models, which can be trained to predict the activity of compounds against the beta-two adrenergic receptor.
