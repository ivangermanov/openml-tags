The Andes Bayesian Network is a large and complex network consisting of nodes and arcs. It has a total of two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, with a staggering one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, and the average degree is three point zero three. The maximum in-degree of the network is six.

This network is a representation of online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It is a powerful tool for understanding and modeling student behavior and problem-solving strategies.

The network features a wide range of variables and concepts, including goals, actions, and problem-solving strategies. It is a valuable resource for researchers and educators interested in understanding how students learn and solve problems.
