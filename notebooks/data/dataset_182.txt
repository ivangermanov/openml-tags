The Satimage dataset consists of multi-spectral values of pixels in three by three neighborhoods in a satellite image, along with the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighborhood. The objective is to predict this classification given the multi-spectral values.

In the sample database, pixel classes are coded numerically. A single frame of Landsat MSS imagery comprises four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these bands correspond approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum, while the other two are in the near infrared range.

Each pixel is represented by an eight bit binary word, with zero corresponding to black and two hundred and fifty five to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is approximately eighty meters by eighty meters. The complete image contains two thousand three hundred and forty by three thousand three hundred and eighty pixels. The database used here is a small sub area of the scene, consisting of eighty two by one hundred pixels.

Each line of data represents a three by three square neighborhood of pixels within the sub area. The data includes pixel values in the four spectral bands for each of the nine pixels in the neighborhood, along with a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel.

Pixels are categorized into several classes: red soil, cotton crop, grey soil, damp grey soil, soil with vegetation stubble, mixture class (all types present), and very damp grey soil. It's worth noting that there are no examples of the mixture class in this particular dataset.

The data is presented in random order, and certain lines have been removed to prevent reconstruction of the original image. There are thirty six predictive attributes, corresponding to four spectral bands for each of the nine pixels in the neighborhood. The spectral values are arranged in a specific order, with the top left pixel given first, followed by top middle, top right, and so on, reading left to right and top to bottom.

The four spectral values for the central pixel are represented by attributes seventeen through twenty. Users may choose to focus solely on these four attributes if desired, which can help avoid issues arising when a neighborhood straddles a boundary. In this version of the dataset, the pixel values have been normalized around zero.
