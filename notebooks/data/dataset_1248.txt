The SensIT Vehicle Combined dataset is a multiclass dataset that combines chemistry and life science tags. This dataset is obtained from the LIBSVM data repository.

Preprocessing involves regenerating features using the authors' MATLAB scripts, which can be found in Section C of Appendix A. Then, ten percent of instances from the noise class are randomly selected to achieve a class proportion of one to one to two for AAV, DW, and noise classes. The training and testing sets are obtained through a random eighty percent and twenty percent split of the data.

This dataset contains a wide range of features, including various attributes from one to ninety-nine, which are essential for understanding the underlying chemistry and life science concepts.
