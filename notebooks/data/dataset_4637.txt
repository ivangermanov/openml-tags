First Order Theorem Proving Seed Two Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the First Order Theorem Proving dataset. It was generated using a specific source code that involves several steps. Firstly, the uniform sampling of classes was performed, where the goal was to select a specified maximum number of classes. This was done by choosing classes randomly, ensuring that each class had an equal probability of being selected.

Once the desired number of classes was reached, the next step involved selecting the indices where one of these chosen classes was present. This resulted in a reduced dataset that only included instances belonging to the selected classes.

The next stage of the process involved uniformly sampling columns. This was necessary because the original dataset had a large number of columns, which needed to be reduced to a specified maximum number. Again, this was achieved through random selection, where each column had an equal chance of being chosen.

Finally, the dataset was further reduced by limiting the number of rows. This was done using a stratified splitting approach, which ensured that the resulting dataset maintained a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of several features, including various variables labeled from Variable One to Variable Fifty-One. The class label is also included in the dataset.
