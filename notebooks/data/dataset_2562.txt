This multivariate regression data set originates from the Online Product Sales competition on Kaggle in two thousand twelve. It focuses on predicting the online sales of consumer products. Each row in the data set corresponds to a different product, which is described by various product features as well as features of an advertising campaign. The data set has twelve target variables, each representing the monthly sales for the first twelve months following the product launch.

For the purposes of this study, examples with missing values in any target variable were removed, along with attributes having only one distinct value. The resulting data set consists of a range of features, including categorical and quantitative variables describing the product and its advertising campaign.

The Osales data set provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the area of multivariate regression, allowing them to develop and test models capable of handling multiple target variables.
