**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample 8.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education. The Barley Bayesian Network is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides".

The network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree of the network is four.

This model was developed to study the production of beer from Danish malting barley grown without the use of pesticides. It features various variables related to barley production, including protein content, sort, and size, as well as environmental factors such as nitrogen and pesticide use.
