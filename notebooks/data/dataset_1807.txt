QSAR-TID-10956 Tags: Language, MTLQSAR, study_3, Text & Literature 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10956. The dataset has fifty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and other human-readable features have been removed for brevity.
