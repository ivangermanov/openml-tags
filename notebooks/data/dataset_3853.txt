QSAR-TID-10462 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10462. The dataset has nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10462. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Ecdysone receptor, a single protein target that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression.

The Ecdysone receptor is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group H. It is involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription and ecdysone receptor-mediated signaling pathway. The receptor is activated by ecdysone, a hormone that plays a key role in insect development and molting.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working on the development of new insecticides and pesticides that target the Ecdysone receptor. It can be used to develop QSAR models that predict the activity of compounds against this target, which can aid in the identification of new lead compounds.
