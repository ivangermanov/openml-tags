Welcome to Sigma Cab Private Limited, a cab aggregator service that allows customers to book a cab from anywhere in the cities they operate in through their mobile app. They search for cabs from various service providers and provide the best option to their clients across available options. Having been in operation for less than a year, they have captured surge pricing type data from the service providers.

As a Data Scientist, I have been hired to build a predictive model that can help Sigma Cabs predict the surge pricing type proactively. This would enable them to match the right cabs with the right customers quickly and efficiently.

The dataset provided includes variables such as Trip ID, Trip Distance, Type of Cab, Customer Since Months, Lifestyle Index, Confidence Lifestyle Index, Destination Type, Customer Rating, Cancellation Last Month, and Gender. The Lifestyle Index is a proprietary index created by Sigma Cabs, which shows the lifestyle of the customer based on their behavior. The Confidence Lifestyle Index is a category that shows the confidence on the Lifestyle Index.

The goal is to predict the Surge Pricing Type, which can be of three types. The dataset also includes three continuous variables, Var1, Var2, and Var3, which are masked by the company but can be used for modeling purposes.
