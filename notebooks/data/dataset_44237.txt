The Digital Images of Bacteria Species dataset, commonly referred to as DIBaS, is a collection of thirty-three bacterial species with approximately twenty images for each species. Due to the limited sample size in each class and the large image sizes, the images were divided into smaller sections before being resized to 128x128 pixels. This resulted in a preprocessed dataset consisting of over four thousand images, with at least one hundred eight images per class. Additionally, blob normalization techniques were applied to reduce the significance of color in decision-making, creating a bias-aware challenge.

### Dataset Details
