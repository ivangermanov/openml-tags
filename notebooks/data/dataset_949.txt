Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion was originally performed to create a simplified binary classification problem from the continuous regression task.

The dataset focuses on the relationship between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer risk in females. It contains various features including group classification, concentration levels, age of subjects, and risk factors. The binarized class feature allows for straightforward classification analysis.

This modified dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in exploring binary classification problems, particularly in the context of environmental health and cancer risk assessment. It provides an opportunity to investigate the potential links between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer incidence in a simplified, dichotomous framework.

Features included in the dataset are group, concentration, age, at risk, and binary class. These features capture key aspects of the study subjects and their exposure to arsenic, enabling various analyses and modeling approaches.
