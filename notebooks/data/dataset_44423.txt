Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its overall characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. The function first selects a subset of classes, then samples columns and rows uniformly. If stratification is required, it uses a train-test split function to ensure the sampled data maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has the following features: line number, assignment number, previous fixation duration, first fixation duration, first pass fixation duration, next fixation duration, first saccade length, last saccade length, previous fixation position, landing position, leaving position, total fixation duration, mean fixation duration, regression length, regression duration, pupil diameter maximum, pupil diameter lag, time protection, title number, word number, and label.
