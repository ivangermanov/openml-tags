ASP POTASSCO Regression 

This dataset was generated for a publication about ClaspFolio 2.0, which is an algorithm selector for Answer Set Programming (ASP). The algorithm portfolio of Clasp configuration was generated by the Hydra method in combination with Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC).

To generate the features, I utilized Claspre, a lightweight version of the ASP solver Clasp, with both static and dynamic features, including four restarts each after thirty-two conflicts.

The dataset includes a wide range of features, including problem variables, free problem variables, assigned problem variables, constraints, rules, equivalences, conflict levels, learnt clauses, and skipped levels while backjumping, among others.

These features aim to capture various aspects of the problem instances, such as their structural properties, constraint types, and solving dynamics, in order to facilitate effective algorithm selection for ASP solvers.
