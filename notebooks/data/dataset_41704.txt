ASP-POTASSCO-Regression Dataset

This dataset was generated for a publication about Claspfolio 2.0, an algorithm selector for Answer Set Programming (ASP). The algorithm portfolio of Clasp configuration is generated by the Hydra method in combination with Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC).

To generate the features, I used Claspre, a lightweight version of the ASP solver Clasp, with static and dynamic features. The features include instance identification, repetition, fraction of negative body, fraction of positive body, fraction of unary rules, fraction of binary rules, fraction of ternary rules, fraction of integrity rules, tightness, problem variables, free problem variables, assigned problem variables, constraints, variables in constraints, created bodies, program atoms, strongly connected components, nodes in positive binary and auxiliary directed graphs, rules, normal rules, cardinality rules, choice rules, weight rules, and various other features related to equivalences, constraints, conflicts, and learning.

The dataset is designed to facilitate the development of algorithm selection models that can effectively choose the best ASP solver for a given problem instance.
