Climate Model Simulation Crashes Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, OpenML100 

Source: University of California, Irvine 

This dataset contains records of simulation crashes encountered during climate model uncertainty quantification ensembles. The ensemble members were constructed using a Latin Hypercube method in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Uncertainty Quantification Pipeline software system to sample the uncertainties of eighteen model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program component of the Community Climate System Model. Three separate Latin Hypercube ensembles were conducted, each containing one hundred eighty ensemble members. Forty-six out of the five hundred forty simulations failed for numerical reasons at combinations of parameter values.

The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes, either fail or succeed, from input parameter values, and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to determine the causes of simulation crashes. 

Attribute Information:

The goal is to predict climate model simulation outcomes given scaled values of climate model input parameters. The dataset consists of twenty-one columns. The first column represents the Latin Hypercube study identification number, ranging from Study One to Study Three. The second column represents the simulation identification number, ranging from Run One to Run One Hundred Eighty. Columns three through twenty represent the values of eighteen climate model parameters scaled in the interval between zero and one. The twenty-first column represents the simulation outcome, where zero indicates failure and one indicates success.
