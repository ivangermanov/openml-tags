**Electricity**

This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark. It is a widely used dataset described and analyzed in various papers. This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, where prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to alleviate fluctuations.

The dataset contains instances dated from May to December. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of thirty minutes, i.e., there are instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has fields, including the day of the week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label. The class label identifies the change of the price in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours and removes the impact of longer-term price trends.

The data was normalized. The dataset contains attribute information, including the date, which is normalized between zero and one; the day of the week; the period, which is the time of the measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours and is normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity price, which is normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity demand, which is normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity price, which is normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity demand, which is normalized between zero and one; and the scheduled electricity transfer between both states, which is normalized between zero and one.
