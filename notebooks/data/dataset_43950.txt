The Electricity dataset is a widely used classification benchmark belonging to the "classification on numerical features" category. It was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, where prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply. To alleviate fluctuations, electricity transfers were made to/from the neighboring state of Victoria.

This dataset contains instances dated from May seventh to December fifth. Each example refers to a thirty-minute period, resulting in forty-eight instances per day. Each instance has eight fields: the day of the week, the timestamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label identifying the change of the price in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours.

Attribute information includes the date, which was normalized between zero and one; the day of the week; the period, representing the time of measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours and also normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity price, normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity demand, also normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity price, normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity demand, normalized between zero and one; and the scheduled electricity transfer between both states, normalized between zero and one.
