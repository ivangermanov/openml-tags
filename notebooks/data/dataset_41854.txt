This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex aud/cad pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active on these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean close price movement between consecutive minutes. Specifically, it is true if the mean close price increases in the subsequent minute and false otherwise, meaning the price either decreases or remains unchanged.
