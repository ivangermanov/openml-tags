Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: assists per minute, height, time played, age, binary class

This dataset focuses on basketball statistics and has been binarized for analysis purposes. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification, allowing for easier categorization of data points. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean value and using it as a threshold to separate instances into positive and negative classes. The dataset includes various player attributes such as assists per minute, height, time played, and age, which can be used to study performance metrics and player characteristics in the context of basketball. The binarized nature of the data makes it particularly suitable for mythbusting studies and comparative analyses within the sport.
