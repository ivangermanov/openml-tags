This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The features included in this dataset are Player Height, Time Played, Age, and a Binary Class.
