This data was collected as a course project for an immersive data science course.

The dataset is in a comma-separated values format, consisting of rows and columns, where each row represents a dataset on Kaggle and each column represents a feature of that dataset.

The title of the dataset, along with its name, usability, and usability rating given by Kaggle, are included in the dataset. Additionally, the number of files associated with the dataset, types of files, and size of the dataset files are also represented. The total votes count by the dataset viewers and the medal reward given to popular datasets, measured by the number of upvotes, are also included. A reference to the dataset page on Kaggle is provided, along with topics tagged with the dataset. The number of features in the dataset, number of views, and number of downloads are also represented, along with the download per view ratio. Finally, the dataset creation date and date of the last update are included.

Acknowledgement is given to the instructors who provided continuous help and support throughout the project. All data was taken from Kaggle, collected on a specific date.

Inspiration for using this dataset includes trying to predict the upcoming datasets uploaded, number of votes, number of downloads, medal type, and so on.

Features include title, usability, number of files, types of files, file size, vote counts, medal, URL reference, keywords, number of columns, views, downloads, download per view, date created, and last updated.

Keywords: computer systems, machine learning, Kaggle, dataset, usability, votes, medal, downloads, prediction.
