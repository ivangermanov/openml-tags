Seeds Data Set

Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. A soft X-ray technique and Grains package were used to construct all seven, real-valued attributes.

The examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian. Seventy elements each were randomly selected for the experiment. High-quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique, which is non-destructive and considerably cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on thirteen by eighteen centimeter X-ray Kodak plates.

Studies were conducted using combine-harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin. The data set can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.

To construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured: area; perimeter; compactness, which is equal to four times pi times area divided by perimeter squared; length of kernel; width of kernel; asymmetry coefficient; and length of kernel groove. All of these parameters were real-valued continuous.

The data set can be utilized for various purposes, including classification and clustering tasks, providing valuable insights into the characteristics of different wheat varieties.
