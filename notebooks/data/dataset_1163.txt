GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets specifically designed for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets enable researchers to estimate various quality metrics, including accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The repository was created in response to the growing demand within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems. By utilizing GEMLeR, researchers can compare and evaluate different classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of their performance.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository, maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and conduct gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The resulting tumor data is updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions, thereby providing direct benefits to patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to utilize data from the expO repository was driven by several key factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the presence of a large number of samples for various tumor types.

When publishing materials based on GEMLeR datasets, users are requested to acknowledge the assistance they received from utilizing this repository, which will facilitate the replication of their experiments by others.
