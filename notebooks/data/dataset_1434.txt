Dataset from the LIBSVM data repository. Preprocessing involved instance-wise normalization to mean zero and variance one, followed by feature-wise normalization to mean zero and variance one. The original dataset consisted of instances, with some removed due to conflicting classification results using immunohistochemistry and protein immunoblotting assay. Additional instances were rejected due to failed array hybridization. The remaining data were further split into training and validation sets.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes related to breast cancer analysis. The features are labeled as attributes, ranging from attribute one to attribute one hundred, and continuing beyond. Due to the extensive number of features, they are not individually listed here.
