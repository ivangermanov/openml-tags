Name: Car Subsample with Four Rows, Two Thousand Rows Maximum, One Hundred Columns Maximum, Ten Classes Maximum, and Stratification Enabled

Tags: Subsampling of the Car dataset with seed equal to four, arguments include number of rows, number of columns, number of classes, and no stratification

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the provided seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the provided maximum values. If the number of classes exceeds the maximum, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
