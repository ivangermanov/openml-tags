Subsampling of the dataset Credit G with Seed equals Zero 

Generated with the following source code:

def subsample(self, seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, stratified sampling) -> Dataset:
random number generator = numpy random default random generator(seed)
features = self features 
target variable = self target variable 

Uniformly sample classes equals target variable unique values 
if length of unique classes is greater than maximum number of classes:
value counts equals target variable value counts 
selected classes equals random number generator choice(unique classes, size equals maximum number of classes, replace equals False, probability equals value counts divided by sum of value counts)
Select the indices where one of these classes is present equals target variable index where target variable is in selected classes 
features equals features iloc select indices 
target variable equals target variable iloc select indices 

Uniformly sample columns if required 
if length of features columns is greater than maximum number of columns:
column indices equals random number generator choice(list of range of length of features columns), size equals maximum number of columns, replace equals False)
sorted column indices equals sorted column indices 
selected columns equals list of features columns at sorted column indices 
features equals features at selected columns 
else:
sorted column indices equals list of range of length of features columns 

if length of features is greater than maximum number of rows:
Stratify accordingly 
target name equals target variable name 
data equals pandas concatenate(features, target variable, axis equals columns)
_, subset equals train test split(data, test size equals maximum number of rows, stratify equals data at target name, shuffle equals True, random state equals seed)
features equals subset drop target name along columns 
target variable equals subset at target name 

We need to convert categorical columns to string for Open ML 
categorical mask equals list of self categorical mask at i for i in sorted column indices 
columns equals list of features columns 
return Dataset(
Technically this is not the same but it's where it was derived from 
dataset equals self dataset,
features equals features, 
target variable equals target variable, 
categorical mask equals categorical mask, 
columns equals columns)

Features: Checking Status, Duration, Credit History, Purpose, Credit Amount, Savings Status, Employment, Installment Commitment, Personal Status, Other Parties, Residence Since, Property Magnitude, Age, Other Payment Plans, Housing, Existing Credits, Job, Number Dependents, Own Telephone, Foreign Worker, Class
