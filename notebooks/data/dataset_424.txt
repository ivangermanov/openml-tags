This is one of forty-one drug design datasets. The datasets with one thousand one hundred forty-three features are formed using Adriana Code software (available at www.molecular-networks.com/software/adriana-code). The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies (listed below). The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.
