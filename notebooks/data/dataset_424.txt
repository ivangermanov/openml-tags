Name: PAH
Tags: Drug Design, Molecular Descriptors, Structure-Activity Relationships

This dataset is one of drug design datasets formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target. The datasets with features are created using molecular descriptors software. Other datasets are taken directly from original studies.

The PAH dataset focuses on modeling physicochemical properties of polyaromatic hydrocarbons using weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors. It is part of a larger collection of datasets used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling in drug design and medicinal chemistry.

Various other datasets in the collection examine properties such as melting point prediction, benzodiazepine receptor binding, PDGFR inhibition, toxicity prediction, and biodegradability of chemical compounds. The datasets cover a wide range of chemical classes including carbolenes, benzimidazoles, phenethylamines, and halogenated aliphatic compounds.

The features used in these datasets represent molecular descriptors calculated to capture different aspects of chemical structure and properties. These descriptors form the basis for developing predictive models of biological activity, physicochemical properties, and other endpoints relevant to drug discovery and toxicology.
