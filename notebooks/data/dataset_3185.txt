QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI50) of several compounds on a specific drug target. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and a class feature representing median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a tyrosine-protein kinase target, which is classified as an enzyme in the protein kinase family, specifically in the tyrosine protein kinase Src family. This protein is found in humans and has various synonyms and accession numbers associated with it. It is involved in numerous biological processes and cellular components, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, endosome, and plasma membrane.

The target protein has multiple functions, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and various protein interactions. It plays roles in important cellular processes like protein phosphorylation, cell surface receptor signaling, axon guidance, learning, and immune system processes. The protein is also involved in several signaling pathways, including T cell receptor signaling, ephrin receptor signaling, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling.

This dataset is part of a larger project aimed at developing quantitative structure-activity relationship models for drug discovery and development. It provides valuable information for researchers studying protein kinases, drug-target interactions, and potential therapeutic interventions for various diseases and conditions.
