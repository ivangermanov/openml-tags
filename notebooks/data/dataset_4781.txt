QSAR Fish Toxicity 

Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning 

Data Description 
The QSAR Fish Toxicity dataset contains values for six attributes, namely molecular descriptors, of nine hundred eight chemicals used to predict quantitative acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales Promelas, also known as fathead minnow. This dataset was utilized to develop quantitative regression QSAR models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales Promelas on a set of nine hundred eight chemicals.

Attribute Description 
The model comprises six molecular descriptors, including information indices, two-dimensional matrix-based descriptors, two-dimensional autocorrelations, atom-type counts, and molecular properties. These descriptors are used to predict the LC fifty value, which is the concentration that causes death in fifty percent of test fish over a test duration of ninety-six hours.

Features 
The dataset includes seven features, namely Cicero, Sm One Dz, Gats One i, Nds Ch, Nds Sc, Molecular Log P, and Lc Fifty. Cicero represents information indices, Sm One Dz represents two-dimensional matrix-based descriptors, Gats One i represents two-dimensional autocorrelations, Nds Ch and Nds Sc represent atom-type counts, Molecular Log P represents molecular properties, and Lc Fifty represents the quantitative response, which is the target feature.

Additional Information 
This dataset was utilized to develop quantitative regression QSAR models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales Promelas on a set of nine hundred eight chemicals. Lc Fifty data, which is the concentration that causes death in fifty percent of test fish over a test duration of ninety-six hours, was used as the model response. The model comprises six molecular descriptors: Molecular Log P, representing molecular properties, Cicero, representing information indices, Gats One i, representing two-dimensional autocorrelations, Nds Sc, representing atom-type counts, Nds Ch, representing atom-type counts, and Sm One Dz, representing two-dimensional matrix-based descriptors.
