This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase II Alpha. It has nine hundred thirty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR models and datasets for various biological endpoints. 

Casein Kinase II Alpha is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA damage response. It is also implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working on developing inhibitors of Casein Kinase II Alpha, which could potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic agents.
