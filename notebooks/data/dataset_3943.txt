This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred two thousand six hundred sixty nine, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, and many others.
