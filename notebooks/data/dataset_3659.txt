QSAR-TID-10403 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10403. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thrombin, which is a single protein. Thrombin is also known as Activation Peptide Fragment One, Activation Peptide Fragment Two, Coagulation Factor Two, and Prothrombin. It belongs to the species group Bos taurus and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, and serine protease PA clan, as well as serine protease S1A subfamily.

Thrombin is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, acute-phase response, blood coagulation, hemostasis, platelet activation, and positive regulation of blood coagulation. It is also associated with various cellular components, including extracellular region, extracellular space, and collagen-containing extracellular matrix.
