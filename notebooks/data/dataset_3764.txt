QSAR-TID-30026 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BRK, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BRK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BRK, and it has multiple rows and features.

The dataset is related to the protein Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BRK, which is a single protein and is also known as Breast Tumor Kinase BRK, Protein-Tyrosine Kinase Six, and PTK Six. It is a protein-tyrosine kinase that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, cell differentiation, and protein phosphorylation.

The dataset is also related to the protein's role in the ERBB Two signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The protein is also involved in the regulation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.
