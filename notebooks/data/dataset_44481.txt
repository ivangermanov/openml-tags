Amazon Commerce Reviews Seed Three Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Amazon Commerce Reviews dataset, generated with a seed of three. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several arguments, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. The function uses the NumPy random default random generator to sample the data.

The dataset features were selected by uniformly sampling the columns, and the target variable was stratified accordingly. The categorical columns were converted to strings for OpenML compatibility.

The resulting dataset has a subset of the original features, which are not human-readable. However, the dataset is suitable for machine learning tasks and can be used for training and testing models.
