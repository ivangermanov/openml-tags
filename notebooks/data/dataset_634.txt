Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate colinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

The Friedman function is one of the most commonly used functions for data generation. It incorporates both linear and non-linear relations between input and output variables, with normalized noise added to the output. The function is expressed as:

y = ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus zero point five squared plus ten multiplied by x four plus five multiplied by x five plus e

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. To assess algorithm robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with different colinearity degrees, representing the number of features depending on other features.

The Friedman datasets vary in the number of features, number of samples, and colinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. The datasets with higher colinearity degrees have more features generated.

As a result, numerous artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. This comprehensive set of datasets allows for thorough testing and evaluation of algorithms under various conditions.

The last attribute in each file represents the target variable. The features are labeled as oz followed by numbers, indicating different input variables used in the dataset generation process.
