The Electricity dataset is a widely used collection of data described and analyzed in various studies. This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, where prices are not fixed and are affected by the demand and supply of the market, being set every five minutes. To alleviate fluctuations, electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done. 

The dataset contains a large number of instances, dated from May seventh nineteen ninety-six to December fifth nineteen ninety-eight. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of thirty minutes, resulting in forty-eight instances for each time period of one day. 

Each example on the dataset has several fields: the day of the week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label. The class label identifies the change of the price, either up or down, in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours, removing the impact of longer-term price trends.

The data was normalized to facilitate analysis. 

Attribute information includes the date, which is normalized between zero and one; the day of the week; the period, which is the time of the measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours, also normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity price, normalized between zero and one; the New South Wales electricity demand, normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity price, normalized between zero and one; the Victoria electricity demand, normalized between zero and one; and the scheduled electricity transfer between both states, normalized between zero and one.
