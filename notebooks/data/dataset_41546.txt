Image Tags: 2019 Multi-Output Paper Benchmark Data

The image benchmark dataset consists of two thousand natural scene images. This dataset was made publicly available as a processed image dataset, with each image being associated with one hundred thirty-five features. Each observation can be associated with different label sets, where all possible labels are desert, mountains, sea, sunset, and trees. About a quarter of the images belong to more than one class. However, images belonging to three classes or more are very rare.

The dataset is a multi-label dataset, meaning that each image can have multiple labels. This makes it a challenging task to classify the images accurately. The dataset is useful for training and testing machine learning models that can handle multi-label classification tasks.

The features of the dataset are not human-readable, but they are useful for training machine learning models. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on image classification tasks.
