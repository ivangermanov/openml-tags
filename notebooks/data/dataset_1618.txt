QSAR-TID-12336 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12336. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The preferred name of the protein target is retinoic acid receptor gamma, also known as rarg retinoic acid receptor, gamma. It belongs to the species group Rattus norvegicus and is classified under transcription factor/nuclear receptor/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group B/nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group B member three.

The description of this protein target is related to retinoic acid receptor, gamma, which is a single protein. It has accession D3ZWV0 and is involved in various biological processes such as negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, neural tube closure, chondrocyte development, glandular epithelial cell development, and many others.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, retinoic acid receptor, transcription factor, nuclear receptor, hormone receptor.
