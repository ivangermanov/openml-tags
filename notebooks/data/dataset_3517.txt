The Estonia Disaster Passenger List

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Introduction

On a fateful night in September, the ferry Estonia embarked on a voyage across the Baltic Sea from the port of Tallinn in Estonia to Stockholm. As it departed, it carried nearly one thousand passengers and crew, along with vehicles, and was scheduled to dock the following morning. However, tragedy struck, and the Estonia never reached its destination.

The weather conditions on that day were typical for the time of year, but unlike other scheduled ferries, the Estonia's fate was sealed. At around one o'clock in the morning, a worrying sound of screeching metal was heard, prompting an immediate inspection of the bow visor, which revealed nothing out of the ordinary. Fifteen minutes later, the ship suddenly listed, triggering a series of alarms, including the lifeboat alarm. In a matter of moments, the Estonia rolled drastically to starboard, leaving those who had not yet reached the decks with little chance of survival.

A Mayday signal was sent, but a power failure meant the ship's position was transmitted inaccurately. As a result, the Estonia vanished from the responding ships' radar screens, leaving behind a trail of chaos and destruction. The Marietta arrived at the scene shortly after, followed by the first helicopter, but their efforts were too late for most on board. In the end, only a handful of survivors were pulled from the icy waters, with many succumbing to hypothermia.

An official inquiry into the tragedy attributed the catastrophe to the failure of the locks on the bow visor, which gave way under the intense pressure of the waves, flooding the car deck and ultimately capsizing the ship. The report also highlighted a lack of decisive action, delays in sounding the alarm, inadequate guidance from the bridge, and a failure to deploy distress flares.

The sinking of the Estonia remains Europe's worst post-war maritime disaster, a testament to the devastating consequences of human error and natural fury.

Interesting avenues of investigation include:

Who was more likely to survive the sinking based on available data?
Does age play a significant role in determining survival rates?
Does gender influence one's chances of survival?
Did the crew members have a higher likelihood of survival compared to passengers?
Can a classifier be developed to outperform the baseline assumption that all passengers perished?
