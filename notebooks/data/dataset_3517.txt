QSAR-TID-87 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cannabinoid CB1 receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cannabinoid CB1 receptor. The Cannabinoid CB1 receptor is a single protein and its preferred name is Cannabinoid CB1 receptor. It is also known as CANN6, Cannabinoid receptor one, CB one, CB-R, CNR. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and its protein target classification is one point Membrane receptor, Family A G protein-coupled receptor, Small molecule receptor, Lipid-like ligand receptor, Cannabinoid receptor.

The dataset has multiple features including MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Cannabinoid CB1 receptor is involved in various biological processes including positive regulation of acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and response to nutrient. It is also involved in learning or memory, memory, and response to lipopolysaccharide.
