The QSAR-TID-87 dataset is a collection of QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Cannabinoid CB1 receptor. This dataset contains 4160 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015.

The Cannabinoid CB1 receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as Cannabinoid receptor 1, CB1, CB-R, CNR. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family A GPCR)/Lipid-like ligand receptor (family A GPCR)/Cannabinoid receptor.

The dataset is related to various other datasets, including CHEMBL2096981, CHEMBL3301387, and CHEMBL3885538, which are supersets of the Cannabinoid receptor protein family, Cannabinoid CB1 receptor/orexin receptor 1 complex, and Cannabinoid receptor 1/Mu-type opioid receptor, respectively.

Several molecules have been identified as interacting with the Cannabinoid CB1 receptor, including NIMACIMAB, an antibody that acts as a negative allosteric modulator; NABILONE, a small molecule that acts as an agonist; SURINABANT, a small molecule that acts as an antagonist; DRINABANT, a small molecule that acts as an antagonist; and CANNABIDIOL, a small molecule that acts as a negative allosteric modulator.
