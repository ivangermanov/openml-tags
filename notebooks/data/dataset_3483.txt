The Brilliant Diamonds Dataset

Buying a diamond can be a frustrating and expensive experience. The complexity and mystique surrounding the value of the four Cs - cut, color, clarity, and carat - inspired me to create this comprehensive dataset of natural and laboratory-created diamonds from Brilliant Earth, aimed at demystifying the factors that determine a diamond's value.

This dataset contains attributes describing each diamond, including:

* Identification Number: A unique identifier assigned to each diamond by Brilliant Earth.
* URL: The web address where detailed information about the diamond can be found.
* Shape: The external geometric appearance of a diamond, which can affect its brilliance and fire.
* Price: The cost of the diamond in US dollars.
* Carat: A unit of measurement used to describe the weight of a diamond, with larger diamonds being more rare and valuable.
* Cut: The facets, symmetry, and reflective qualities of a diamond, which can greatly impact its beauty and value.
* Color: The natural color or lack of color visible within a diamond, graded according to the Gemological Institute of America's (GIA) scale.
* Clarity: The visibility of natural microscopic inclusions and imperfections within a diamond, also graded according to the GIA's scale.
* Report: The diamond certificate or grading report provided by an independent gemology laboratory.
* Type: Whether the diamond is naturally occurring or laboratory-created.
* Date Fetched: The date on which the data was collected.
