**Dataset Description**

The data contains information on superconductors. The first eighty-one columns contain extracted features, and the eighty-second column contains the critical temperature, which is used as the target variable. The original data from which the features were extracted comes from the public website http://supercon.nims.go.jp/index_en.html.

**Related Studies**

This dataset is related to studies on superconductivity, including a study published in Frontiers in Materials.

The dataset features include various properties of elements, such as atomic mass, atomic radius, density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence. These features are calculated using different methods, including mean, weighted mean, geometric mean, weighted geometric mean, entropy, weighted entropy, range, weighted range, and standard deviation.
