The Superconduct dataset is part of the regression on numerical features benchmark in computer systems and machine learning. It contains information on superconductors, with eighty-one columns featuring extracted characteristics and one column containing the critical temperature, which serves as the target variable.

The original data was sourced from the National Institute for Materials Science website, a publicly available resource. Related studies on this topic have been published, including a paper titled "Machine Learning Prediction of Critical Temperature of Superconductors".

This dataset was originally sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. To use this dataset, please ensure to follow the UCI citation policy.

The dataset includes various features, such as mean atomic mass, weighted mean atomic mass, geometric mean atomic mass, weighted geometric mean atomic mass, entropy of atomic mass, and many more. These features cover properties like atomic radius, density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence.
