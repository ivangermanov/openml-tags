Subsampling of the Adult Dataset with Seed Zero 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the well-known Adult dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset until the desired number of classes was reached. In this case, the maximum number of classes was set to ten. 

Once the desired number of classes was reached, the corresponding indices were selected, and the data was filtered accordingly. This ensured that only the data points belonging to the selected classes were retained.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled until the desired number of columns was reached. In this case, the maximum number of columns was set to one hundred. The column indices were randomly chosen, and the data was filtered based on the selected column indices.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled until the desired number of rows was reached. In this case, the maximum number of rows was set to two thousand. The sampling was done in a stratified manner to ensure that the class distribution was preserved.

The resulting dataset consists of several features, including Age, Work Class, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship, Race, Sex, Capital Gain, Capital Loss, Hours per Week, Native Country, and Class.
