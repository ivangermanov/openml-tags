At Santander, our mission is to help people and businesses prosper. We are always looking for ways to help our customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals. Our data science team is continually challenging our machine learning algorithms, working with the global data science community to make sure we can more accurately identify new ways to solve our most common challenge, binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?

Our dataset, Santander Customer Satisfaction, is designed to help us better understand our customers' needs and preferences. The dataset features a range of variables, including customer information and transaction data, which we use to train our machine learning models. By analyzing these variables, we can gain insights into customer behavior and develop more effective strategies for improving customer satisfaction and driving business growth.
