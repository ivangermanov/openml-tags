**Guess which points belong to signal track**

The COMET experiment is currently under construction at the J-PARC proton beam laboratory in Japan. Its primary objective is to search for coherent neutrino-less conversion of a muon to an electron, μ- + N(A,Z) → e- + N(A,Z), a process that violates the law of lepton conservation. If detected, it would be a strong indication of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The previous upper limit for this decay was established by the SINDRUM II experiment. COMET aims to surpass this limit by a factor of 10,000.

**Cylindrical Drift Chamber**

The COMET experiment relies on the Cylindrical Drift Chamber as its primary detector for physics measurements. Specifically, the momentum of resulting particles will be measured using the CyDet, a cylindrical wire array detector. Particles emerging from the muon-stopping target are registered by the CyDet. Among these, we are particularly interested in tracks left by electrons with specific energy, produced by muon-to-electron conversion.

The CyDet consists of 4,482 sensitive wires organized in eighteen layers. Each wire measures the energy deposited by a passing charged particle. Within each layer, the wires have the same distance to the stopping target and stereometric angle.

There is a magnetic field present in the detector, causing electrons to move in a helical path. As they travel, they deposit energy in the wires close to their flight path. The radius of the helix is directly proportional to the transverse momentum of the electron: R = p_t / (eB), where p_t is the transverse momentum, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and e is the charge of the electron.

The energy deposited on each wire is measured at the end plate of the cylindrical detector. An example of a resulting signal event can be seen below, where blue dots represent background hits and red dots signify hits from signal electrons:

**Important Note**

Datasets available for this challenge are results of preliminary Monte Carlo simulations. While they do not accurately represent the properties of COMET's detector, they are suitable for testing different approaches to tracking.
