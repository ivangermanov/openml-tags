Gender Classification Dataset 
Tags: Context 

While practicing machine learning, I wanted to create a simple dataset closely aligned to a real-world scenario, providing better results to satisfy my curiosity in this domain. As a beginner trying to solve classification problems in machine learning, preferring to achieve better results, utilizing this dataset in projects will be an excellent starting point.

This dataset contains seven features and a label column. The Long Hair column contains zeros and ones, where one indicates "long hair" and zero indicates "not long hair." Forehead Width is measured in centimeters, representing the width of the forehead. Forehead Height, also measured in centimeters, represents the height of the forehead. 

The Wide Nose column contains zeros and ones, where one indicates "wide nose" and zero indicates "not wide nose." Similarly, the Long Nose column contains zeros and ones, where one indicates "long nose" and zero indicates "not long nose." The Thin Lips column contains zeros and ones, where one represents "thin lips," while zero represents "not thin lips." 

The Distance Between Nose and Lips column contains zeros and ones, where one represents a "long distance between nose and lips," while zero represents a "short distance between nose and lips." Lastly, the Gender column is either "Male" or "Female."

Acknowledgments 
Nothing to acknowledge, as this is simply made-up data.

Inspiration 
It can be disheartening to see poor results initially. As a beginner, avoid starting with complicated datasets. I am confident that this dataset will motivate you to progress further in the domain. Good luck!
