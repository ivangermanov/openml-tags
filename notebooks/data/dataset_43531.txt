Gender Classification Dataset
Tags: Context

While I was practicing machine learning, I wanted to create a simple dataset that is closely aligned to a real-world scenario and gives better results to whet my appetite in this domain. If you are a beginner who wants to try solving classification problems in machine learning and if you prefer achieving better results, try using this dataset in your projects, which will be a great place to start.

This dataset contains seven features and a label column. The Long Hair column contains zeros and ones, where one represents "long hair" and zero represents "not long hair". The Forehead Width column is in centimeters, representing the width of the forehead. The Forehead Height column is also in centimeters, representing the height of the forehead. The Wide Nose column contains zeros and ones, where one represents "wide nose" and zero represents "not wide nose". The Long Nose column contains zeros and ones, where one represents "long nose" and zero represents "not long nose". The Thin Lips column contains zeros and ones, where one represents "thin lips" and zero represents "not thin lips". The Distance Between Nose and Lips column contains zeros and ones, where one represents "long distance between nose and lips" and zero represents "short distance between nose and lips". The Gender column is either "Male" or "Female".

Acknowledgements
Nothing to acknowledge, as this is just made-up data.

Inspiration
It's painful to see bad results at the beginning. Don't begin with complicated datasets if you are a beginner. I'm sure that this dataset will encourage you to proceed further in the domain. Good luck.
