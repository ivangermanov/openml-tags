QSAR-TID-102913 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it includes a range of features that describe the molecular structure of the compounds.

The features in this dataset are primarily FCFP 1024-bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that captures the structural properties of molecules. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a string of characters.

The dataset is intended for use in QSAR modeling and machine learning applications, where the goal is to predict the activity of compounds based on their molecular structure.
