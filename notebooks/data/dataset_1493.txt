Description:
This dataset contains information on one hundred plant species leaves, focusing specifically on texture features. The data was collected from leaf samples at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK. The original dataset includes binary images (masks) of the leaf samples, though the color images are not included.

Dataset Information:
The dataset comprises three main features for each leaf sample: Shape, Margin, and Texture. Each feature is represented by a sixty four element vector, either as a contiguous descriptor (for shape) or as histograms (for texture and margin). The dataset provided here focuses on the texture-based prediction, using the 'data Tex' file.

Each sample in the dataset consists of a sixty four element feature vector followed by the Class label. There are one thousand six hundred samples in total, with sixteen samples per leaf class across one hundred classes. The dataset is complete with no missing values.

Attributes Information:
The dataset contains three sixty four element feature vectors per sample, representing various aspects of leaf texture.

Relevant Papers:
Several papers have been published using this dataset, focusing on plant leaf classification using various features including shape, texture, and margin. These studies have employed techniques such as probabilistic integration, Gabor co occurrences, and combined shape and texture analysis for classification purposes.

The dataset has applications in botanical research, plant species identification, and computer vision tasks related to plant classification. It provides a comprehensive resource for researchers working on automated plant recognition systems and leaf-based plant taxonomy.
