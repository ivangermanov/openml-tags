This dataset belongs to the regression on categorical and numerical features benchmark.

The dataset is part of a collection of forty-one drug design datasets. These datasets were formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs were taken from the original studies.

The original studies include Carbolenes, MTP Two, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two. 

Carbolenes was originally published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen ninety-six. MTP Two was originally published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science in two thousand three. 

Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two were originally published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen ninety-six.

Other datasets include MTP, Benzo Thirty-Two, PHENETYL One, PAH, PDGFR, Phen, Topo Two One, YPROP Four One, QSABR One, QSABR Two, QSARTOX, QSBR RW One, QSBR Y Two, QSBRALKS, QSFRDH LA, QSFSR One, QSFSR Two, and QSPRCMPX.
