The Leukemia Three Classes dataset, also known as AML-Three, is a life science and medicine related dataset focused on molecular classification of cancer through gene expression monitoring.

This dataset contains a large number of features, including various types of genes and their corresponding expressions. The features include genes related to biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Although some feature names may appear technical and difficult to understand, they are essential for analyzing and interpreting the data.

The Leukemia Three Classes dataset has been widely used in research studies focused on understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying leukemia and other types of cancer. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of different samples, researchers can identify patterns and correlations that may lead to new insights into the disease.

Molecular classification of cancer involves identifying specific genes and their expression levels that are associated with particular types of cancer. This approach has the potential to improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes.
