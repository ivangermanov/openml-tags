Leukemia with Three Classes (Leukemia-3, AML-3) dataset

This dataset is a microarray dataset that contains molecular classification of cancer, specifically focusing on class discovery and class prediction by gene expression monitoring.

The dataset features a wide range of genes, including those related to biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. These genes are represented by their corresponding probe sets, which are used to measure their expression levels.

The dataset is composed of a large number of features, including but not limited to: genes involved in cell signaling, metabolism, and gene regulation; genes that are specific to certain tissues or cell types; and genes that are involved in various biological pathways.
