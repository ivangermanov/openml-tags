The Friedman datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is widely used for data generation because it provides a comprehensive testing ground for various algorithms.

The original Friedman function has five features for input, which are related to the output. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output.

However, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are varied to test different scenarios. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, with only the first five features being related to the output. The rest are completely random. The number of samples also varies, ranging from one hundred to one thousand.

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four, indicating the level of dependence between features. For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target variable.
