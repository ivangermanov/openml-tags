Dataset Name: One Hundred Plants Texture

Description:
The One Hundred Plants Texture dataset is a collection of data related to the classification of one hundred plant species based on their leaf textures.

Sources:
The original owners of the color leaves samples are from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK.

Dataset Information:
The dataset consists of binary images (masks) of the leaf samples, excluding color images. There are three features for each image: Shape, Margin, and Texture. For each feature, a sixty-four element vector is given per leaf sample. These vectors are taken as a contiguous descriptor (for shape) or histograms (for texture and margin).

The dataset is divided into three files, each corresponding to a specific feature problem:

* Prediction based on shape
* Prediction based on texture (provided in this dataset)
* Prediction based on margin

Each row in the dataset contains a sixty-four-element feature vector followed by the Class label. The dataset comprises a total of sixteen hundred samples with sixteen samples per leaf class, and no missing values.

Attributes Information:
Each sample in the dataset has three sixty-four-element feature vectors.
