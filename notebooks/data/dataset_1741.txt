This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Thromboxane A2 Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various biological targets. It provides valuable information for researchers working on drug discovery and development.

The Thromboxane A2 Receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as Prostanoid TP Receptor, Tbxa two r, Thromboxane A two Receptor, TXA two-R, and TXR two. It belongs to the family of small molecule receptors, specifically lipid-like ligand receptors, and is classified under one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor.

This receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in regulating vasoconstriction, blood coagulation, and angiogenesis.
