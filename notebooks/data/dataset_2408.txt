The Reuters dataset is a multi-label dataset used for text classification tasks. It is a subset of the larger Reuters collection and contains two thousand observations. The dataset is commonly used in benchmarking papers, including the 2016 multi-label R benchmark paper.

This dataset is particularly useful for exploring topics related to demographics and economics. The features included in the dataset are numerous, totaling over one hundred fifty. While these features may not be easily interpretable by humans, they provide a rich source of information for machine learning models.
