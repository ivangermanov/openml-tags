This dataset, known as Smogon Six Versus Six Pokémon Tiers, stems from a popular Pokémon dataset, focusing on listing the tiered Pokémon in Smogon Six Versus Six. Smogon Six Versus Six is one of the most well-known formats for competitive Pokémon, attracting a large following despite not being the official competitive format.

In this format, Pokémon are categorized into different tiers, with the most popular being Overused, also referred to as OU. This dataset aims to provide an easy-to-analyze format for competitive players by displaying both a Pokémon's statistics and its corresponding tier.

Several changes have been made to the original dataset, including classifying mythical Pokémon as legendary, adjusting the naming convention for mega evolutions and certain form changes, and adding a mega tier to denote mega evolutions. Note that this dataset only includes Pokémon tiered from Pure Uncut to Anything Goes, excluding Not Fully Evolved and Little Cup Pokémon unless they appear in Smogon's list.

The list of which Pokémon belong to each tier can be found online. This dataset contains the following features: Name, Type One, Type Two, Total, Hit Points, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Generation, Legendary Status, Mega Evolution, and Tier.
