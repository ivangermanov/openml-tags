This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10885, is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 10885. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains demographic information about the compounds, including their molecular structure and properties. The molecular structure is represented by fingerprints, which are a way of encoding the molecular structure into a numerical representation.

The dataset is useful for predicting the activity of compounds on the drug target TID: 10885, and can be used for virtual screening and lead optimization. It is also a valuable resource for understanding the relationships between molecular structure and biological activity.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug target, virtual screening, lead optimization.
