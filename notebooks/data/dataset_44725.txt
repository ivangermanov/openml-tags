Name: Adult Dataset Subsample with Two Thousand Rows and Ten Classes Tags: Subsampling of the Adult Dataset with Stratification

This dataset is a subsample of the Adult dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed ten. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, retaining only the instances that belonged to these classes.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled, reducing the number of columns to one hundred. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and make it more manageable.

Finally, the dataset was further subsampled to contain a maximum of two thousand rows. This was done using stratified sampling, which ensured that the class distribution in the subsample was representative of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, including age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country. The class feature has been retained, with ten distinct classes.
