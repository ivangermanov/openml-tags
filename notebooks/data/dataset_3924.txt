This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10297, is tagged as Government and MTLQSAR, and is part of the study number three. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dated back to September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values in terms of pseudo-pCI50, for various compounds against the drug target identified by the ID 10297. In total, there are eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent Fixed-Count Fingerprint 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Notably, generating fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The features include molecule identifiers, followed by a series of fingerprint features, which are essential for understanding the properties of the molecules.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug target, compound activity, pseudo-pCI50.
