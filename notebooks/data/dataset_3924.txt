The GDP Per Capita All Countries dataset, tagged with Machine Learning and Social Media, presents the monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country during a specific period, thereby providing an economic snapshot of a country. This indicator is used to estimate the size of an economy and its growth rate.

This dataset contains the Gross Domestic Product based on Purchasing Power Parity, which is arguably more useful than nominal Gross Domestic Product when assessing a nation's domestic market. The reason for this is that Purchasing Power Parity takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services, and inflation rates of the country, rather than relying on international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income.

Features include Country Name and Country Code, followed by annual data from Nineteen Ninety onwards.

Keywords: Gross Domestic Product, Purchasing Power Parity, Economy, Growth Rate, Per Capita Income, International Market Exchange Rates.
