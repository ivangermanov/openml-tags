This dataset, named QSAR-TID-100425, falls under the categories of Economics, Life Science, and MTLQSAR, and is part of the study three of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values of various compounds on the drug target TID one hundred forty-two five, with eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features, namely MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty. 

These features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four-bit molecular fingerprints, generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. As generating fingerprints typically doesn't require missing value imputation, all bits are generated.

The dataset consists of numerous features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one thousand twenty-four-bit molecular fingerprint features.

Scraped data reveals information about the drug target, specifically trace amine-associated receptor one, also known as Ta one, Taar one, Tar one, and TaR-one. It belongs to the species group Rattus norvegicus and falls under the classification of single protein, being a membrane receptor and a family A G protein-coupled receptor, specifically a small molecule receptor and a monoamine receptor.

Description and relationship accession for this receptor is Q nine two three Y nine. Component analysis shows that it is present in the plasma membrane and membrane. Functional analysis reveals its involvement in trace-amine receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and G protein-coupled amine receptor activity.

In terms of biological processes, it participates in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cAMP-mediated signaling. 

Cross-references for this receptor include canSAR-target, Guide To PHARMACOLOGY, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
