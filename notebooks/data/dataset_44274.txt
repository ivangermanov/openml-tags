**Meta Album Textures ALOT Dataset (Micro)**

The Textures ALOT dataset, which consists of images from two hundred and fifty categories, is a comprehensive collection of textures captured in a controlled environment. The images in the dataset showcase different viewing angles, illumination angles, and illumination colors for each material of texture. A preprocessed version of Textures ALOT is used in the Meta Album meta-dataset, where the images are first cropped into square images and then resized to a uniform size with an anti-aliasing filter.
