The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, currently in its sixteenth data release, provides a vast repository of data on galaxies, stars, and quasars. This dataset is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license.

The presented table is the result of a query that joins two tables: PhotoObj, containing photometric data, and SpecObj, containing spectral data. The resulting table consists of sixteen variables of type double and one additional variable of type char, namely 'class'.

Each object in the dataset is characterized by a unique identifier, known as objid, as well as its position in the sky, specified by its right ascension and declination values. The dataset also provides photometric measurements in different bands, including u, g, r, i, and z.

In addition to these photometric measurements, the dataset includes information about the observation process, such as the run number, rerun number, camera column, and field number. These values identify the specific image and location within the image where the object was observed.

The class variable categorizes each object into one of three classes: galaxy, star, or quasar. The dataset also provides spectral data, including the redshift value, which describes the degree of shift in the object's spectrum due to its velocity.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey employs a four-color UVGR intermediate-band photometric system, as well as a five-color wide-band CCD system, which is described in detail in various references.

To access this dataset, users can utilize the SkyServer SQL Search tool, which allows them to execute queries and retrieve the desired data. The dataset is maintained by the SDSS collaboration, and its creation has enabled the development of the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the universe to date.
