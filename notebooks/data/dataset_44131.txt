The Jannis dataset is part of the Computational Universe and is used for machine learning purposes. It is one of the datasets featured in the tabular data benchmark, which has been transformed in a specific way to facilitate analysis.

This dataset falls under the category of classification on numerical features, which means that it involves training models to predict categorical labels based on numerical input variables. The original description of the challenge emphasizes the importance of working with real-world datasets that are relevant to industry partners, while also providing a uniform format for easy comparison across different approaches.

Each dataset in the benchmark has been preprocessed into a matrix format, allowing researchers to focus on developing effective classification algorithms without worrying about data preprocessing steps. Although additional feature extraction methods are permitted, they must comply with the rules of the challenge to ensure fair comparison.

All problems in this challenge involve binary classification, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes. Performance is evaluated using the normalized area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which provides a robust measure of model performance. The AUC metric is scaled to range from minus one to one, where higher values indicate better performance.

To maintain fairness and consistency throughout the evaluation process, each code submission is executed on a standardized compute worker with specific hardware and software configurations. The execution time is limited to prevent excessive resource usage and ensure timely completion of evaluations.

The ultimate goal of the challenge is to identify the most effective approach for solving these classification problems, while also promoting innovation and collaboration within the research community.
