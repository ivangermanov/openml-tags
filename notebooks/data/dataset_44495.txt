Name: Numerai Dataset Subsample

Tags: Subsampling of the Numerai dataset with seed, stratify True

This dataset is a subsample of the original Numerai dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are representative of the overall distribution. The number of classes was limited to a maximum of ten, and the classes were selected based on their frequency in the original dataset.

Once the classes were selected, the corresponding data points were extracted, and the columns were uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The number of columns was limited to a maximum of one hundred. The resulting dataset was then stratified to ensure that the class distribution was maintained.

The dataset consists of a subset of the original features, which are not human-readable. The features are a combination of numerical and categorical attributes, which were selected based on their relevance to the problem at hand.
