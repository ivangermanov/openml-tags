MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-10506

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10506. It has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset provides information about the molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50, along with nine hundred ninety-two features representing FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10506.
