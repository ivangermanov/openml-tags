Name: Blood Transfusion Service Center Seed Two 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Blood Transfusion Service Center with seed equals two arguments number rows max equals two thousand arguments number cols max equals one hundred arguments number classes max equals ten arguments no stratify equals true 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in several parameters including a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to use stratification or not. It uses numpy's default random generator to ensure reproducibility.

First, it selects the unique classes present in the target variable. If there are more classes than the specified maximum, it uses value counts to determine the probability of each class being selected and then chooses the specified number of classes randomly without replacement. 

Next, it filters out the samples that do not belong to the chosen classes. It then checks if the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum. If so, it randomly selects the specified number of column indices without replacement, sorts them, and filters out the columns that were not selected.

Finally, if the remaining number of samples exceeds the specified maximum, it uses train-test splitting with stratification based on the target variable to reduce the number of samples. The resulting dataset is then returned along with its metadata.
