Name: Blood Transfusion Service Center

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Blood Transfusion Service Center with seed, number of rows, number of columns, number of classes, and stratify arguments.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a subsampled version of it. It uses the NumPy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the corresponding columns from the dataset.

If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. This ensures that the class distribution is preserved in the subsampled dataset.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
