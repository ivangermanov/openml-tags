Synthetic two-class problem: This dataset contains information from a synthetic two-class problem. It includes two real-valued coordinates (xs and ys) and a class (xc) which is either 0 or 1. These features represent a synthetic classification problem designed for pattern recognition and neural network research.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the fields of machine learning, pattern recognition, and neural networks. It offers a controlled environment for testing and validating classification algorithms and models.

By utilizing this synthetic dataset, researchers can explore various aspects of classification problems, including decision boundaries, feature importance, and model performance. The two-dimensional nature of the coordinates allows for easy visualization of the problem space and the resulting classification outcomes.

Features: xs, ys, yc

Keywords: synthetic dataset, classification problem, pattern recognition, neural networks, machine learning, two-class problem, real-valued coordinates
