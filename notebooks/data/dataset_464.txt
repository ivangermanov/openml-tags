The Friedman datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation. Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is a complex mathematical equation that models the relationship between the input features and the output variable.

To generate the datasets, five features were initially considered as inputs, and then additional features were added to measure the effects of unrelated features. These added features are independent from the output. Furthermore, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets were generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets have varying parameters, including the number of features, which range from five to one hundred, and the number of samples, which range from one hundred to one thousand. Additionally, the colinearity degrees vary from zero to four, where a higher degree indicates a greater level of dependence among the features.

In total, eighty artificial datasets were generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. Each dataset has a target attribute, which is the last attribute in each file.
