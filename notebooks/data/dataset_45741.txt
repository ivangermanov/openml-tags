This dataset, named Beans, aims to distinguish seven different types of dry beans, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. 

The dataset was created to develop a computer vision system to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of grains of seven different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. 

Bean images obtained by the computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of sixteen features were obtained from the grains. 

The features include the area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries, bean circumference defined as the length of its border, the distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean, the longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis, the relationship between the longest and shortest axes, the eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region, the number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed, the diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area, the ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area, the ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans, the roundness calculated with a specific formula, the compactness measuring the roundness of an object, and four shape factors. 

The dataset has seven class labels, which are Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz, and Sira.
