QSAR-TID-10378 Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10378, and it consists of one thousand three hundred thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by one thousand twenty-four FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset was created for the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it for your research.
