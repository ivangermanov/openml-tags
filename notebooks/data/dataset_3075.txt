QSAR TID Dataset

Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation.

The dataset focuses on Cathepsin B, a single protein target also known as APP secretase, Cathepsin B, and Cathepsin B heavy chain. It is found in Homo sapiens and classified as an enzyme/protease/cysteine protease in the CA clan and C1A family. Cathepsin B is involved in various biological processes including proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, regulation of peptidase activity, collagen catabolism, epithelial cell differentiation, and apoptosis regulation.

Cathepsin B is located in multiple cellular components such as the extracellular region, lysosome, plasma membrane, endolysosome lumen, and melanosome. Its molecular functions include endopeptidase activity, cysteine type peptidase activity, protein binding, and collagen binding. The protein is associated with several biological pathways, including collagen degradation, trafficking and processing of endosomal TLR, assembly of collagen fibrils, MHC class II antigen presentation, and neutrophil degranulation.

The target is referenced in multiple databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It has been studied in relation to various disease associations and potential drug targets.
