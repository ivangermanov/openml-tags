This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mu Opioid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mu Opioid Receptor.

Mu Opioid Receptor is a single protein target also known as M-OR-one, MOR-one, Mu-type Opioid Receptor, Opioid Receptor B, and Oprm one. It is a membrane receptor and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes including acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, immune response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It also plays a role in behavioral responses to different substances and is associated with various diseases.

The dataset includes multiple features that describe the molecular properties of the compounds. These features are used to predict the activity of the compounds on the Mu Opioid Receptor.
