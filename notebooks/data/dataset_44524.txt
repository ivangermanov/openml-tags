Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using random sampling with replacement. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it selects a specified number of columns from the filtered data using random sampling without replacement. It then filters the data to include only the selected columns.

Finally, it selects a specified number of rows from the filtered data using stratified sampling to maintain the original distribution of the data.
