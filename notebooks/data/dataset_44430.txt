Subsampling of the dataset Jannis with Seed Equal to Two 
Tags: Statistics, Transportation 

This dataset has been generated through subsampling of the original Jannis dataset. The subsampling process involves reducing the number of rows, columns, and classes while maintaining the overall characteristics of the original dataset.

The subsampling process begins with uniformly sampling classes from the unique values present in the target variable. In cases where the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of classes is made based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset. The indices corresponding to these selected classes are then used to filter the dataset.

Next, the process involves uniformly sampling columns from the dataset. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of column indices is made, and the corresponding columns are retained.

Finally, the dataset is further reduced by randomly selecting a specified number of rows while ensuring that the class distribution remains intact. This is achieved through stratified sampling, which helps maintain the proportion of each class in the resulting dataset.
