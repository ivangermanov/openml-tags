The Epsilon dataset is a collection of data related to chemistry and life science, obtained from the PASCAL Challenge 2008 and made available on the LibSVM repository.

Preprocessing of the raw data involved instance-wise scaling to unit length, followed by splitting into two parts: four-fifths for training and one-fifth for testing. The training portion was then feature-wise normalized to have a mean of zero and variance of one, and subsequently instance-wise scaled to unit length again. Using the scaling factors derived from the training portion, the testing portion underwent similar processing.

This dataset includes both the training and testing splits. It comprises numerous features, including those related to chemical properties and biological processes.
