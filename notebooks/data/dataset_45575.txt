**Epsilon Dataset**

**Description**

The Epsilon dataset is a collection of data from the PASCAL Challenge 2008, available on the LibSVM repository. The dataset has undergone preprocessing, where the raw data was instance-wise scaled to unit length and split into two parts: four-fifths for training and one-fifth for testing. The training part was then feature-wise normalized to mean zero and variance one, and subsequently instance-wise scaled to unit length. Using the scaling factors of the training part, the testing part was processed in a similar manner. This dataset was used in a research paper.

**Notes**

This dataset contains both the train and test split. The dataset features are numerous, but unfortunately, they are not human-readable.
