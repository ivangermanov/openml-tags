The Sylva Agnostic dataset is derived from the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge. This dataset contains the agnostic version of a dataset from the Remote Sensing and GIS Program of Colorado State University for the time span June 2005 to September 2006. A similar, raw, and not-agnostic dataset is termed the Covertype Dataset and can be found in the UCI Database.

The task of Sylva is to classify forest cover types. The forest cover type for thirty by thirty meter cells is obtained from the US Forest Service Region Two Resource Information System data. We brought it back to a two-class classification problem, classifying Ponderosa pine versus everything else.

The agnostic data consists of two hundred sixteen input variables. Each pattern is composed of four records: two true records matching the target and two records picked at random. Thus, half of the features are distracters. The prior knowledge data is identical to the agnostic data, except that the distracters are removed and the identity of the features is revealed.

Data type is non-sparse. This dataset contains samples from both training and validation datasets.
