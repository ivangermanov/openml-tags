The QSAR-TID-102406 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Carboxypeptidase B. This dataset has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen and should be cited accordingly. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule in the dataset, while the median pXC fifty represents the activity value of each compound on the drug target.

The drug target, Carboxypeptidase B, is an enzyme that belongs to the metallo protease M fourteen A subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, and has peptidase, metallocarboxypeptidase, and hydrolase activities.

This dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and machine learning approaches to predict the activity of new compounds on the Carboxypeptidase B target.
