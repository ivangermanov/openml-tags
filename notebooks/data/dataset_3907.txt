QSAR-TID-10031 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10031. The dataset has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are used to represent the chemical structure of compounds.

The dataset contains a single protein target, which is the Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor. This receptor is a type of G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, smooth muscle contraction, and lipolysis.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop predictive models for the Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor, as well as for those who want to study the structure-activity relationships of compounds that interact with this receptor.
