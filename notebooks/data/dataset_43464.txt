UFC Fights with Betting Odds

Tags: Context

There are some great UFC datasets out there, but I could not find one that included gambling odds. So I went and created one myself. This dataset focuses very generally on the fights and hopes to be able to draw very broad conclusions. For a more in-depth statistical fight analysis, I would recommend a more specialized dataset, which was the inspiration for my work.

Content

This dataset consists of eleven columns of data with basic information about every match that took place between two specific dates. 

Column Definitions:

The Red Corner Fighter and The Blue Corner Fighter: The names of the fighters in the respective corners.
The Red Corner Fighter Odds and The Blue Corner Fighter Odds: The American odds of the fighter winning.
Date: The date of the fight.
Location: The location of the fight.
Country: The country the fight occurred in.
Winner: The winner of the fight, either 'Red' or 'Blue'.
Title Bout: Was this fight a title bout? Either 'True' or 'False'.
Weight Class: What weight class did this fight occur at?
Gender: Male or Female.

Acknowledgements

My work, including a scraper to help gather data for upcoming events, can be found online. I promise I'll add more documentation soon.
