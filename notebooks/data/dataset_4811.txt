This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. It is a transformation of the original Bioresponse dataset.

The goal of this dataset is to predict a biological response of molecules based on their chemical properties. Each row in the dataset represents a unique molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing whether the molecule elicited a biological response or not. The remaining columns represent various molecular descriptors, which are calculated properties that capture certain characteristics of the molecule, such as its size, shape, or elemental constitution. These descriptors have been normalized.

The original training and test sets were merged into a single dataset.
