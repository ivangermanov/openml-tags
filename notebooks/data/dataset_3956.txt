QSAR-TID-103800 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103800. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The Apelin receptor, also known as the Angiotensin receptor-like 1, is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, blood vessel development, and heart development. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is activated by the apelin peptide.

The dataset provides a detailed description of the Apelin receptor, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The receptor is classified as a single protein and is a member of the membrane receptor family.

The dataset also includes information on the mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval of the Apelin receptor. Additionally, it provides references to PubMed and other databases, which can be used to access more information on the receptor.
