The QSAR-TID-103800 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103800. This dataset has ninety-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The Apelin receptor is a single protein, also known as Angiotensin receptor-like one, Apelin receptor APJ, APLNR, and other synonyms. It is found in Homo sapiens species group and belongs to the membrane receptor family, specifically the Family A G protein-coupled receptor group.

This receptor has been shown to be involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, blood vessel development, vasculogenesis, heart development, signal transduction, and many others.

The dataset provides information about the relationship between the Apelin receptor and its ligands, including Apelin, which is an agonist of this receptor. It also includes information about the mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval of these ligands.

The Apelin receptor is classified as a G protein-coupled receptor, which means it is involved in signal transduction pathways. It has been shown to play a role in various physiological processes, including heart development, blood pressure regulation, and angiogenesis.
