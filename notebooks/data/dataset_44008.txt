Pol Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "Regression on Numerical Features" benchmark.

This dataset describes a telecommunication problem, but no further information is available. It is a commercial application described in a research paper. The data consists of a large number of cases, each with numerous continuous attributes.

The dataset is part of a collection of regression datasets, which can be obtained from a website. The original data in its original format can also be obtained from another website.

The dataset contains a range of features, including various numerical attributes. These features are important for modeling and predicting the target variable in a regression task.
