This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero one zero four one, and it has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systèmes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
