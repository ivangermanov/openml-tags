The bodyfat dataset, tagged as OpenML-Reg, provides estimates of body fat percentage determined by underwater weighing and various body circumference measurements for men. This dataset is suitable for illustrating multiple regression techniques in classroom settings. It addresses the need for convenient and cost-effective methods of estimating body fat, as accurate measurement can be inconvenient and expensive.

The dataset includes measurements such as body density, age, weight, height, and various circumferences including neck, chest, abdomen, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, biceps, forearm, and wrist. These measurements are used to develop predictive equations for lean body weight.

Body fat percentage can be estimated using body density, which is calculated through underwater weighing. This technique computes body volume as the difference between body weight measured in air and weight measured during water submersion, with appropriate temperature corrections for water density.

The data can be used to explore relationships between body measurements and body fat percentage, as well as to develop and evaluate predictive models for estimating body composition. It offers insights into the application of anthropometric measurements for health assessment and fitness evaluation.

The dataset originates from research in exercise physiology and body composition analysis. It has been used in studies exploring the relationship between simple body measurements and more complex assessments of body composition. The data reflects the interest in developing practical methods for estimating body fat percentage without requiring specialized equipment or procedures.

This resource is valuable for researchers, students, and practitioners in fields such as nutrition, exercise science, and health assessment. It provides a practical example of how simple measurements can be used to estimate more complex physiological characteristics, demonstrating the application of statistical techniques to real-world health and fitness questions.
