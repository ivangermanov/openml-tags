QSAR-TID-10019 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10019. The dataset has thirty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10019. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has thirty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the target protein, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target protein is Pepsinogen C, also known as Gastricsin, which is a single protein that belongs to the enzyme/protease/aspartic protease/aspartic protease AA clan/aspartic protease A1A subfamily.

The dataset also contains information on the expression, function, and process of the target protein, including its expression in different tissues, its function in various biological processes, and its role in different pathways.
