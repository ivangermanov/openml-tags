Life Science, Machine Learning, MTL QSAR Study Dataset: QSAR-TID-10019

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one thousand nineteen, and it has thirty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent Finger Print Circuit Finger Prints one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating finger prints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.

This dataset was part of the Meta QSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values unit is pseudo pCI fifty of several compounds on drug target TID one thousand nineteen.

Scraped data includes information about the protein target, specifically gastricsin also known as pepsinogen C, which is a single protein and an enzyme protease aspartic protease.
