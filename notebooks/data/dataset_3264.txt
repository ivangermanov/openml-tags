We conducted an extensive scraping operation on a vast number of eBay auctions featuring a highly sought-after product. Following a rigorous preprocessing phase, we successfully constructed the Shill-Bidding dataset. Our primary objective is to share this meticulously labeled dataset with fellow researchers in the field.

The comprehensive dataset boasts a range of informative features, including Record Identification, Auction Identification, Bidder Identification, Bidder Tendency, Bidding Ratio, and Successive Outbidding patterns. Additionally, the dataset encompasses details about the Last Bidding activity, total Auction Bids, average Starting Price, incidence of Early Bidding, Winning Ratio, and Auction Duration. Each entry is accompanied by a definitive classification.
