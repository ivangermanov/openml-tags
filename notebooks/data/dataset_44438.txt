Name: Eye Movements Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses the numpy random default random generator to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. If the number of classes is greater than nclasses max, it selects the top nclasses max classes based on their frequency. If the number of columns is greater than ncols max, it uniformly samples ncols max columns. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, it uses stratified sampling to select nrows max rows.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, including the categorical mask and column names.
