Data Description 
This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex CHF/JPY currency pair obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance, represented by a row, corresponds to one hourly candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is closed during these days. The time zone of the feature Timestamp is set to Europe/Amsterdam.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask prices of the subsequent hour, relative to the mean of the High Bid and High Ask prices of the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is labeled as True if the mean High price is expected to increase in the following hour, and False otherwise, indicating that the mean High price will either decrease or remain unchanged.

Please note that this task is hypothetical and intended solely for scientific research purposes. In reality, trading strategies should only be based on predictions made on Close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
