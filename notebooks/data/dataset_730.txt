This dataset has been tagged under categories including Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study, and more. The source of this dataset remains unknown.

A binarized version of the original dataset has been created, which involves converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process is done by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as Negative, denoted by 'N'. 

The dataset includes various features, although they may not be easily interpretable.
