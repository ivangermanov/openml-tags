Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). 

Features: oz, oz, oz, oz, oz, binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature across all instances. Instances with target values below this mean are classified as positive ('P'), while those at or above the mean are classified as negative ('N'). This binarization transforms the original regression problem into a two-class classification task.

The dataset includes several features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers, suggesting they may represent measurements in ounces or some other unit denoted by "oz". The final feature is explicitly named "binary Class", which likely corresponds to the newly created binary target variable resulting from the aforementioned conversion process.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its derived nature and cite it appropriately, acknowledging both the original source and the binarization process applied to create this version.
