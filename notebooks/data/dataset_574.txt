This database was carefully designed based on data provided by the United States Census Bureau. The data were meticulously collected as part of the nineteen ninety United States census. These are mostly counts cumulated at different survey levels. For the purpose of this data set, a level State-Place was utilized. Data from all fifty states was obtained. Most of the counts were transformed into suitable proportions. There are four distinct data sets obtained from this comprehensive database: House Eight High, House Eight Low, House Sixteen High, and House Sixteen Low. These are all concerned with predicting the median price of the house in the region based on demographic composition and the state of the housing market in the region. The number in the name signifies the number of attributes of the data set. A following letter denotes a very rough approximation to the difficulty of the task. Tasks with low task difficulty have had their attributes carefully chosen to make the modeling easier due to higher correlation of the inputs to the target. On the other hand, tasks with high difficulty have had their attributes deliberately chosen to make the modeling more challenging due to higher variance or lower correlation of the inputs to the target.
