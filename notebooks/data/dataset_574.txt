Please cite: This database was designed on the basis of data provided by US Census Bureau (under Lookup Access: Summary Tape File). The data were collected as part of the US census. These are mostly counts cumulated at different survey levels. For the purpose of this data set, a level State-Place was used. Data from all states was obtained. Most of the counts were changed into appropriate proportions.

There are different data sets obtained from this database: House(H) House(L) House(H) House(L). These are all concerned with predicting the median price of houses in regions based on demographic composition and the state of the housing market in the area. The letter in the name denotes a very rough approximation to the difficulty of the task. For Low task difficulty, more correlated attributes were chosen as signified by univariate smooth fit of that input on the target. Tasks with High difficulty have had their attributes chosen to make the modeling more difficult due to higher variance or lower correlation of the inputs to the target.
