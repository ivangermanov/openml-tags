Capitol Riot Tweets is a dataset consisting of a CSV file containing over eighty thousand tweets from January sixth, two thousand and twenty one, the day of the Capitol Hill riots. This dataset was created using the Twitter Developer API and Tweepy. Although it is significantly smaller than the Parler data dumps, it may still hold valuable insights for those with natural language processing experience.

The tweets in this dataset have been preprocessed to remove mentions, hyperlinks, emojis, and punctuation. All text has been converted to lowercase. Some tweets also include coordinates, which were obtained from users who had geotagging enabled. Verified users have their usernames included, and their self-reported location is provided if it corresponds to a US state or Washington DC.

The dataset features a range of attributes, including the tweet's unique identifier, the text of the tweet, the query used to retrieve the tweet, the user's unique identifier, their username, the number of followers they have, the number of tweets they have posted, the number of likes and retweets the tweet received, the name of the location mentioned in the tweet, and the longitude and latitude of that location.
