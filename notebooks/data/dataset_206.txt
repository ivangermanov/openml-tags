Please cite: The problem is to learn a regression equation, rule, or tree to predict the activity from the descriptive structural attributes. The data and methodology are described in detail in two forthcoming publications in Applied Artificial Intelligence and the Journal of Computer Aided Molecular Design. These papers compare artificial intelligence methods for modeling Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) and examine the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by triazines using neural networks and inductive logic programming.

The dataset was originally collected as part of a compilation of regression datasets. It contains cases with continuous variables representing various structural and chemical properties. These features include polarity, size, flexibility, hydrogen bonding capabilities, pi electron interactions, polarizability, sigma bonds, and branching characteristics for multiple molecular components.

The goal is to predict the activity of triazine compounds based on these structural descriptors. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers studying structure-activity relationships in drug design and chemical informatics.

The dataset provides an opportunity to apply various machine learning and statistical techniques to understand the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. It can be used to develop predictive models that could aid in the design of new triazine-based compounds with desired properties.
