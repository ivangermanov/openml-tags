Ozone Level Detection

Tags: Earth Science, Meteorology

The ozone level detection dataset provides information on various atmospheric conditions that affect ozone levels. This dataset has been used in forecasting skewed biased stochastic ozone days, which involves analyzing and solving problems related to ozone day predictions.

The dataset contains seventy-three attributes, which include features such as wind speed, temperature, solar radiation, and precursor emissions-related factors. These attributes are highly valued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).

Some of the key attributes include local ozone peak prediction, upwind ozone background level, precursor emissions-related factor, maximum temperature, base temperature, solar radiation total for the day, wind speed near sunrise, and wind speed mid-day.

The dataset consists of 2536 instances, each representing a unique combination of these attributes. The instances are divided into two classes: ozone days and normal days.

Features of the dataset include wind speed measurements at different times of the day, temperature measurements at various heights, relative humidity, wind directions, geopotential height, sea level pressure, precipitation, and other meteorological factors.

The dataset has missing values, which need to be considered when performing analysis or modeling tasks.
