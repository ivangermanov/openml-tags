Title: Nursery Database
Abstract: Four-class version of the original Nursery dataset

This dataset is a modified version of the Nursery database, focusing on classifying nursery school applications into four distinct categories. The original dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been adapted for specific research purposes. The nursery dataset aims to evaluate and categorize applications for nursery schools based on various factors and criteria.

The dataset provides valuable insights into the decision-making process for nursery school admissions, taking into account multiple variables that influence the acceptance or rejection of applicants. By analyzing these factors, researchers and educational institutions can gain a better understanding of the key determinants in nursery school placements and potentially improve the allocation process.

Features: The dataset includes several features that are used to assess nursery school applications. These features likely encompass various aspects of the child's background, family situation, and other relevant criteria for admission consideration.

Class: The class attribute represents the final decision or category assigned to each nursery school application, divided into four distinct classes.
