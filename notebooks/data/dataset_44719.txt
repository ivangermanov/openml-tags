Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the dataset by uniformly selecting classes and columns, and then stratifying the sample according to the target variable. The subsampling process involves several steps. First, it selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed a specified maximum. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns from the filtered data, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed a specified maximum. Finally, it stratifies the sample according to the target variable, ensuring that the sample size does not exceed a specified maximum.

The function takes several arguments, including the seed for random number generation, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample. It returns a subsampled dataset with the specified characteristics.
