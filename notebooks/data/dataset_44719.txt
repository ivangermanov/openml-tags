Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete Seed One Dataset 

Tags: Subsampling of the Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a fixed seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the target variable were identified, and a random selection of classes was made based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the data.

Next, a random selection of columns was made, ensuring that the number of columns did not exceed the specified maximum. The data was then filtered based on these selected columns.

Finally, the dataset was further subsampled to ensure that the number of rows did not exceed the specified maximum. This was done using stratification, which helps maintain the balance of classes in the resulting dataset.

The resulting dataset contains the selected features, which include information about the strength and position of chess pieces, as well as the target variable representing the class label.
