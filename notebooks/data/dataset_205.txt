Sleep Dataset

Tags: Unknown Source, StatLib

Data from which conclusions were drawn in the article "Sleep in Mammals: Ecological and Constitutional Correlates" published in Science. The dataset includes information on brain and body weight, life span, gestation time, time sleeping, and predation and danger indices for various mammals.

Variables in the Mammals Data Set include species of animal, body weight in kilograms, brain weight in grams, slow wave (non-dreaming) sleep in hours per day, paradoxical (dreaming) sleep in hours per day, total sleep in hours per day (sum of slow wave and paradoxical sleep), maximum life span in years, gestation time in days, predation index, sleep exposure index, and overall danger index.

The predation index ranges from minimum (least likely to be preyed upon) to maximum (most likely to be preyed upon). The sleep exposure index ranges from least exposed (e.g., animal sleeps in a well-protected den) to most exposed. The overall danger index is based on the above two indices and other information, ranging from least danger to most danger from other animals.

Missing values are denoted by a specific numerical value. The dataset can be freely used for non-commercial purposes and can be freely distributed with permission obtained from the original researcher.

Total sleep is treated as the class attribute. Attributes for slow wave and paradoxical sleep have been deleted, as well as the animal's name. Features include body weight, brain weight, maximum life span, gestation time, predation index, sleep exposure index, danger index, and total sleep.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying the relationship between sleep patterns and various ecological and physiological factors in mammals.
