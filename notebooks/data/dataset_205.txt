The Sleep in Mammals dataset contains ecological and constitutional correlates for sixty-two mammalian species. This dataset was compiled from research published in the article "Sleep in Mammals: Ecological and Constitutional Correlates" in the journal Science. The dataset includes various physiological and environmental characteristics, such as brain and body weight, life span, gestation time, time spent sleeping, and indices of predation and danger.

Each entry in the dataset represents a unique mammalian species, characterized by its body weight in kilograms, brain weight in grams, maximum life span in years, gestation time in days, predation index, sleep exposure index, and overall danger index. These characteristics provide insight into the complex relationships between an organism's physiology, behavior, and environment.

The dataset can be freely used for non-commercial purposes and can be freely distributed. It is particularly useful for researchers investigating the correlations between sleep patterns, ecology, and constitution in mammals.
