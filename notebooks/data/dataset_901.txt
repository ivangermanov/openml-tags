Tags: Binarized Regression Problem, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset consists of various features, including those related to chemical properties and life sciences. The goal of this dataset is to facilitate research and analysis in these fields.
