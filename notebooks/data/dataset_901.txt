The PC2 dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, specifically designed for software defect prediction. This dataset originates from flight software for an Earth-orbiting satellite, featuring extracted McCabe and Halstead metrics from the source code. These metrics, defined in the 1970s, aim to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Relevant studies have investigated the reliability and effectiveness of these datasets. For instance, researchers have commented on the data quality of the NASA software defect datasets, highlighting potential issues and limitations. Additionally, other studies have assessed predictors of software defects using these datasets, examining the efficacy of various sampling policies.

This comprehensive dataset includes a range of features, including branch count, call pairs, lines of code and comments, condition count, cyclomatic complexity, decision count, design complexity, edge count, essential complexity, Halstead content, maintenance severity, modified condition count, multiple condition count, node count, normalized cyclomatic complexity, number of lines, and percent comments.
