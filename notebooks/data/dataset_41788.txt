**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex Australian Dollar/New Zealand Dollar pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded during these days. The timezone of the feature Timestamp is set to Europe/Amsterdam.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following day, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is expected to increase the following day, and false when the mean High price is expected to decrease or remain the same the following day.

**Note:** This dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for real-world trading decisions. For realistic trade strategies, predictions based on Close attributes should be utilized instead.
