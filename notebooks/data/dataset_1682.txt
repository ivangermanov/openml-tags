This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10450, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred forty-five hundred and fifty.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling.

The dataset is suitable for machine learning and cheminformatics analysis, particularly for predicting the activity of compounds on this specific drug target.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of computer-aided drug design and discovery.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug design, cheminformatics, machine learning, MetaQSAR.
