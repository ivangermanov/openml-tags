This file describes the contents of the heart disease directory, which contains four databases concerning heart disease diagnosis. All attributes are numeric valued. The data was collected from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, and University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

Each database has the same instance format. While the databases have seventy six raw attributes, only fourteen of them are actually used. Thus, two copies of each database have been made: one with all the attributes and one with the fourteen attributes actually used in past experiments.

The authors of the databases have requested that any publications resulting from the use of the data include the names of the principal investigator responsible for the data collection at each institution.

The databases contain information on heart disease diagnosis, with attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from zero (no presence) to four. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values one, two, three, four) from absence (value zero).

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

The databases vary in size, with Cleveland having three hundred and three instances, Hungarian having two hundred and ninety four, Switzerland having one hundred and twenty three, and Long Beach VA having two hundred.

Past usage of this data includes international probability analysis, instance based prediction of heart disease presence, and conceptual clustering. Various machine learning techniques have been applied to this data, achieving accuracy rates between seventy four and eighty one percent.

This dataset has been widely used in the field of machine learning and medical diagnosis, providing valuable insights into the factors associated with heart disease.
