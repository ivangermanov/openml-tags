Heart Disease Databases 

The heart disease databases contain four datasets concerning heart disease diagnosis. All attributes are numeric-valued. The data was collected from four different locations: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, California, and University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. 

Each database has the same instance format. While the databases have seventy-six raw attributes, only fourteen of them are actually used. Two copies of each database have been made: one with all the attributes and one with the fourteen attributes actually used in past experiments.

The databases have been previously used in several studies. One study applied a new probability algorithm for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, achieving approximately seventy-seven percent correct classification accuracy with a logistic-regression-derived discriminant function. Another study used an instance-based approach to predict heart disease presence with the Cleveland database, achieving seventy-seven point zero percent accuracy. A third study used a conceptual clustering system to achieve seventy-eight point nine percent accuracy on the Cleveland database.

This database contains seventy-six attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of fourteen of them. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from zero (no presence) to four. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence from absence.

One file has been processed, containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory. The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

There are five hundred twenty instances in total across the four databases. The number of instances for each database is three hundred three for Cleveland, two hundred ninety-four for Hungarian, one hundred twenty-three for Switzerland, and two hundred for Long Beach VA.

There are seventy-six attributes in total, including the predicted attribute. However, only fourteen attributes are actually used. These attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, old peak, slope, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and diagnosis of heart disease.

Several attribute values are missing, distinguished with a value of negative nine point zero. The class distribution varies across the four databases. For example, in the Cleveland database, there are one hundred sixty-four instances with no presence of heart disease, fifty-five instances with a presence level of one, thirty-six instances with a presence level of two, thirty-five instances with a presence level of three, and thirteen instances with a presence level of four.
