Please cite: Syskill and Webert Web Page Ratings

This database contains the HTML source of web pages plus the ratings of a single user on these web pages. The web pages cover four separate subjects: Bands (recording artists), Goats, Sheep, and BioMedical. The HTML source of each web page is provided. Users examined each web page and indicated their preference on a three point scale (hot, medium, cold). Between fifty and one hundred pages were rated per domain. This approach is realistic because the goal is to learn user profiles from as few examples as possible, providing users with an incentive to rate pages. The primary challenge is to predict user ratings for web pages within a specific subject category. Early publications reported on the accuracy of predicting ratings, while later publications utilized metrics such as precision at top N or the F measure.

The dataset includes the HTML source of web pages along with user ratings. Users evaluated each page on a three point scale ranging from hot to cold. The number of pages rated per domain varied but generally fell between fifty and one hundred. This limited sample size is intentional, as the aim is to learn user preferences from minimal input, thus encouraging user participation in the rating process. The main objective is to develop models that can accurately predict how a user will rate new web pages within a given topic area. Initial research focused on rating prediction accuracy, while subsequent studies employed alternative evaluation metrics like precision at top N and F measure to assess performance.

Features: id, text, class

Dataset Information:
The HTML source code for each web page is provided in the dataset. Users evaluated the pages using a three point rating scale of hot, medium, or cold. The dataset contains between fifty and one hundred rated pages for each topical domain. This relatively small sample size reflects the real world goal of learning user preferences efficiently from limited input. The primary task is to predict how users will rate previously unseen web pages within the same subject area.

Additional Information:
The HTML source of each web page is included. Users rated the pages on a three point scale (hot, medium, cold) with fifty to one hundred pages rated per domain. This approach realistically models the desire to learn user profiles from minimal examples, incentivizing users to provide ratings. The dataset does not contain any missing values.
