The Syskill and Webert Web Page Ratings dataset contains the HTML source code of various web pages along with their corresponding ratings from a single user. These web pages fall under four distinct categories: Bands, which feature information about recording artists; Goats; Sheep; and Bio Medical.

Each user was asked to review a set of fifty to one hundred web pages within a specific domain and provide a rating on a three-point scale, which consisted of hot, medium, and cold. Although this may seem like a limited number of samples, it is intentionally designed to simulate real-world scenarios where users are motivated to rate pages based on their interests.

The primary objective of this dataset is to develop a system that can accurately predict user ratings for web pages within a particular subject category. In previous studies, the performance of such systems was evaluated based on their ability to correctly predict user ratings. More recent research has employed alternative metrics, including precision at top N and the F-measure, to assess the effectiveness of these systems.

This dataset does not contain any missing values.
