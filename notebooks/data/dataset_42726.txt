Abalone Data

The Abalone dataset is a collection of physical measurements of abalone, a type of large sea snail, used to predict their age. The age of abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope, a time-consuming and laborious task. To simplify this process, other measurements are used to predict the age, which may require additional information such as weather patterns and location, affecting food availability.

The dataset originates from a non-machine-learning study, "The Population Biology of Abalone (Haliotis species) in Tasmania. I. Blacklip Abalone (H. rubra) from the North Coast and Islands of Bass Strait," by the Marine Resources Division Marine Research Laboratories, Tasmania.

The dataset contains 4177 instances, each with eight attributes: Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole Weight, Shucked Weight, Viscera Weight, and Shell Weight. The number of rings, which determines the age of the abalone, is the target variable to predict. The attributes are a mix of nominal and continuous values, with the continuous values scaled for use with artificial neural networks by dividing by 200.

Previous studies have used this dataset to benchmark various machine learning algorithms, including Cascade-Correlation, C4.5, Linear Discriminate Analysis, and k-Nearest Neighbour. The dataset is challenging due to the high overlap between samples, requiring additional information to separate them completely using affine combinations.
