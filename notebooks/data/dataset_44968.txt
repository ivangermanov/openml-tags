**Synchronous Machine Tags**

**Data Description**
Synchronous motors are AC motors that operate at a constant speed. The synchronous machine data was obtained in real time from an experimental operating environment. The task at hand is to estimate the excitation current of the synchronous motor.

**Attribute Description**
The first four features are parameters of the synchronous motor. These include the load current, power factor, power factor error, and changing of excitation. The excitation current is the target feature.

**Features**
Load Current, Power Factor, Power Factor Error, Changing of Excitation, Excitation Current

**Scraped Data**
