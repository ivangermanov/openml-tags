QSAR-TID-11094 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11094. It consists of one hundred ninety-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It includes molecule Chembl ID and median PX fifty.

The molecule Chembl ID is an identifier for each molecule, and the median PX fifty represents the activity value of each compound.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

This dataset was scraped from the Chembl database, which provides a rich source of bioactivity data. 

The target protein is thromboxane A synthase, also known as cytochrome P four fifty five A one. It is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of thromboxane A two from prostaglandin H two. 

Thromboxane A synthase is a single protein preferred name, and its synonyms include Cyp five, Cyp five A one, hydroperoxy icosatetraenoate dehydratase, and Tbxas one. 

It belongs to the species Rattus norvegicus and is classified under the enzyme cytochrome P four fifty family five A group. 

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including prostaglandin biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and response to ethanol. 

It is also associated with certain components, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol.
