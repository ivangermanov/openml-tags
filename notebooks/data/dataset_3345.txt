QSAR-TID-17076 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17076. The dataset has fifty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17076. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Vasopressin V2 receptor, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is also known as the Antidiuretic hormone receptor, AVPR2, AVPR V2, Renal-type arginine vasopressin receptor, and V2R. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by vasopressin, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of gene expression, cellular response to hormone stimulus, and positive regulation of vasoconstriction.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the Vasopressin V2 receptor and related biological processes.
