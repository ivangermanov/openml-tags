Primary Tumor Dataset
Tags: study_1, study_41, study_76, uci

This primary tumor domain was obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. The dataset is one of three domains provided by the Oncology Institute that has repeatedly appeared in the machine learning literature, alongside breast cancer and lymphography datasets.

The dataset contains information on primary tumors and their locations. It includes attributes such as the patient's age, sex, histologic type of the tumor, degree of differentiation, and various metastasis indicators for different body parts including bone, bone marrow, lung, pleura, peritoneum, liver, brain, skin, neck, supraclavicular region, axillar region, mediastinum, and abdominal area.

The class attribute represents the location of the tumor, with possible values including lung, head and neck, esophagus, thyroid, stomach, duodenum and small intestine, colon, rectum, anus, salivary glands, pancreas, gallbladder, liver, kidney, bladder, testis, prostate, ovary, corpus uteri, cervix uteri, vagina, and breast.

The dataset consists of instances with attributes including the class attribute. Some attributes have missing values, indicated by question marks in the original data. The age attribute is categorized into three groups: less than 30, 30-59, and 60 or older. The sex attribute is binary, either male or female. The histologic type is classified as epidermoid, adeno, or anaplastic. The degree of differentiation is categorized as well, fairly, or poorly differentiated.

This dataset has been used in various machine learning studies, with different algorithms achieving varying levels of accuracy in predicting the tumor location based on the given attributes. The dataset provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners in the field of oncology and machine learning, offering insights into the relationships between various factors and primary tumor locations.
