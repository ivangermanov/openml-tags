Title: seismic-bumps Data Set

Abstract: The data describe the problem of high energy (higher than 10^4 J) seismic bumps forecasting in a coal mine. Data come from two longwalls located in a Polish coal mine.

Data Set Information:
Mining activity has always been associated with various dangers, commonly referred to as mining hazards. Seismic hazard is a particularly challenging threat that occurs in many underground mines. It is one of the most difficult natural hazards to detect and predict, comparable to earthquakes in its unpredictability. Advanced seismic and seismoacoustic monitoring systems have improved our understanding of rock mass processes and enabled the development of seismic hazard prediction methods. However, the accuracy of these methods remains far from perfect.

The complexity of seismic processes and the significant disproportion between low-energy and high-energy seismic events make statistical techniques insufficient for predicting seismic hazards. This necessitates the exploration of new approaches for improved hazard prediction, including machine learning methods. Data clustering techniques and artificial neural networks have been applied in seismic hazard assessment and tremor prediction, respectively.

Most applications report results in binary states, interpreted as "hazardous" or "non-hazardous". The unbalanced distribution of positive (hazardous) and negative (non-hazardous) examples poses a significant challenge in seismic hazard prediction. Current methods struggle to achieve satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in predictions.

Various factors influence seismic hazard occurrence, including the occurrence of tremors with energy exceeding 10^4J. The primary goal of seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict periods of increased seismic activity that may lead to rockbursts, with specified time and date precision.

In this dataset, each row summarizes seismic activity in the rock mass during one eight-hour shift. A decision attribute value of 1 indicates that a seismic bump with energy higher than 10^4 J was registered in the following shift. The hazard prediction is based on the relationship between recorded tremor energy, seismoacoustic activity, and the possibility of rockburst occurrence.

Accurate prediction of increased seismic activity has significant practical importance, as it allows appropriate supervision services to implement risk reduction measures or evacuate workers from threatened areas. The dataset is characterized by an unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples, with only 170 positive examples representing class 1.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes various attributes such as seismic and seismoacoustic hazard assessments, shift type, seismic energy recordings, pulse counts, energy deviations, hazard assessments based on specific geophones, numbers of seismic bumps in different energy ranges, total energy of seismic bumps, maximum energy of seismic bumps, and the decision attribute indicating hazardous or non-hazardous states.
