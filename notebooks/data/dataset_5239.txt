Three-Dimensional Location Estimation Using Received Signal Strength Indication of Wireless Local Area Network Dataset

The Three-Dimensional Location Estimation Challenge using Received Signal Strength Indication of Wireless Local Area Network aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning-based localization algorithm that can accurately estimate the position of a receiver based on received signal strength indication information from surrounding radio transmitters, including height information, enabling the estimation of the target's three-dimensional location.
