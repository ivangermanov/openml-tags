QSAR-TID-10677 Tags: Earth Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10677. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
