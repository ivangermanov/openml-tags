QSAR-TID-10677 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10677. The dataset has fifty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10677. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Bradykinin B1 receptor, which is a single protein target. The Bradykinin B1 receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and cell migration.

The dataset provides information about the Bradykinin B1 receptor, including its synonyms, such as B1bkr, B1 bradykinin receptor, B1R, Bdkrb1, and BK-1 receptor. The dataset also provides information about the organism, species group, and protein target classification of the Bradykinin B1 receptor.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Bradykinin B1 receptor and its role in various biological processes.
