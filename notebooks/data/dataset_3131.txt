QSAR-TID-23 Tags: MTLQSAR, Social Media, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID twenty-three. It has one hundred ninety-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, molecular fingerprints from zero to nine hundred twenty-five, and more.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

Description:
Plasma Kallikrein is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the blood clotting process. It is involved in the activation of factor twelve and the subsequent formation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator.
