QSAR-TID-23 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17 showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI50) of several compounds on drug target TID: 23. It comprises 198 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information on Plasma kallikrein, also known as Fletcher factor, Kininogenin, KLK3, KLKB1, and PKK. It is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. The protein target classification is Enzyme/Protease/Serine protease/Serine protease PA clan/Serine protease S1A subfamily.

Several compounds are associated with this target, including Ecallantide, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor approved in 2009, and Berotralstat, a small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor approved in 2020. Other related compounds include Human C1-esterase inhibitor, Avoralstat, and Lanadelumab.

The target is involved in various biological processes, including Factor XII activation, proteolysis, inflammatory response, blood coagulation, hemostasis, zymogen activation, plasminogen activation, and fibrinolysis. It is found in the extracellular region, extracellular space, plasma membrane, and extracellular exosomes.

The protein has serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding capabilities, and hydrolase activity. It is associated with several GO terms related to its cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes.
