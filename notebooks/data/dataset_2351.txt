KEGG Metabolic Reaction Network

Tags: Geography, Life Science

Data Set Information:
KEGG metabolic pathways can be realized into a network. Two kinds of networks or graphs can be formed, including Reaction Networks and Relation Networks. In Reaction networks, substrate or product compounds are considered as nodes, and genes are treated as edges. On the other hand, in relation networks, substrate and product compounds are considered as edges, while enzymes and genes are placed as nodes. We took a large number of metabolic pathways from KEGG XML and modeled them into graphs as described above. With the help of the Cytoscape tool, a variety of network features were computed.

Attribute Information:
The pathway text is accompanied by several attributes, including connected components, diameter, radius, centralization, shortest path, characteristic path length, average number of neighbors, density, heterogeneity, isolated nodes, number of self-loops, multi-edge node pairs, neighborhood connectivity, number of directed edges, stress, self-loops, partner of multi-edged node pairs, degree, topological coefficient, betweenness centrality, radiality, eccentricity, number of undirected edges, closeness centrality, average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, node count, and edge count.

Relevant Papers:
Cytoscape is a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks, which was used in this study.

The dataset includes various network features, including pathway text, connected components, diameter, radius, centralization, shortest path, characteristic path length, and many others.
