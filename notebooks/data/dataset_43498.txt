Land Market in Saudi Arabia Tags:

This dataset has been scraped from sa.aqar.fm to obtain land information such as price, size, street width, and locations. After removing duplicates, the cleaned dataset consists of a total of rows. Unfortunately, the majority of the data is based in Riyadh, but there are a significant number of lands in Jeddah and Khobar. The dataset is set in Arabic, and it was decided to keep it that way to maintain the integrity of the data. However, the street width, land size, and price have all been converted to numerical values, leaving some of those values as null if they could not be converted.

The dataset includes the following information:

Main Location: The main location of the land
Sublocation: Indicates the subregion of the location. Note that only the big cities, such as Riyadh and Jeddah, have subregions, and empty values are meant to be empty.
Neighborhood: The neighborhood where the land resides
Frontage: The cardinal direction where the land faces the street
Purpose: The purpose for land use
Street Width: The length of the street facing the land in meters
Size: The size of the land in square meters
Price per Square Meter: The price per square meter
