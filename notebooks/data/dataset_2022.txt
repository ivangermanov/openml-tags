QSAR-TID-116 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 116. It has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints from zero to nine hundred twenty-six.
