The QSAR-TID-10889 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor. This dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature representing the median pseudo-pCI50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor is a single protein, also known as the Thyroliberin Receptor or TRH-R, and is classified as a Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to G protein-coupled receptor signaling.

This receptor is also associated with various biological processes, including the positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration and the positive regulation of protein-containing complex assembly. Additionally, it has been linked to several cellular components, including the cell surface and membranes.
