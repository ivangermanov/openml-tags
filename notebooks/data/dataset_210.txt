These data were collected in a cloud seeding experiment in Tasmania between mid nineteen sixty four and January nineteen seventy one. Their analysis, using regression techniques and permutation tests, is discussed in a scientific paper published in Communications in Statistics - Theory & Methods.

The rainfalls are period rainfalls measured in inches. TE and TW represent the east and west target areas respectively, while NC, SC, and NWC correspond to the rainfalls in the north, south, and north west control areas respectively. S indicates seeded clouds, while U indicates unseeded clouds.

Rain in the eastern target region is being treated as the class attribute. The attribute for rain in the western target region has been removed from the dataset.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying the effects of cloud seeding on rainfall patterns in different geographical areas. It allows researchers to compare seeded and unseeded cloud conditions across various target and control regions, potentially offering insights into the effectiveness of cloud seeding techniques for rainfall enhancement.
