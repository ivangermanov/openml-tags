The Cloud dataset consists of data collected during a cloud-seeding experiment conducted in Tasmania between mid nineteen sixty-four and January nineteen seventy-one. This comprehensive study employed advanced statistical methods, including regression techniques and permutation tests, to analyze the outcomes of this experiment. 

These findings were extensively discussed in a prominent scientific publication, which provided an in-depth examination of the results. The rainfall data, measured in inches, comprises period rainfalls in various regions, including the Eastern Target area, Western Target area, North Control area, South Control area, and North-West Control area. 

Additionally, the dataset distinguishes between seeded and unseeded periods. The primary focus of this study is on the rainfall in the Eastern Target region, which is treated as the class attribute.

Features: period, seeding status, seasonal information, North Control rainfall, South Control rainfall, North-West Control rainfall, Eastern Target rainfall.
