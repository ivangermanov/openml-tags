**Chemical Composition of Ceramic Samples**

This dataset focuses on Human Activities and includes Images.

The energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence was used to determine the chemical composition of celadon body and glaze in Longquan kiln and Jingdezhen kiln. Forty typical shards in four cultural eras were selected to investigate the raw materials and firing technology. The goal is to identify chemical elements that are the strongest explanatory variables to classify samples into different cultural eras and kilns.

### Attribute Information

* Ceramic Name: name of ceramic types from Longquan and Jingdezhen
* Part: a binary categorical variable indicating whether the sample is from the Body or Glaze
* Chemical composition percentages:
	+ Sodium Oxide
	+ Magnesium Oxide
	+ Aluminum Oxide
	+ Silicon Dioxide
	+ Potassium Oxide
