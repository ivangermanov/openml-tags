The Chemical Composition of Ceramic Samples Data Set is a collection of data that aims to identify the chemical elements that are the strongest explanatory variables to classify samples into different cultural eras and kilns. This data set was created using the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) technique to determine the chemical composition of celadon body and glaze in Longquan kiln and Jingdezhen kiln.

Forty typical shards in four cultural eras were selected to investigate the raw materials and firing technology used in the creation of these ceramics. The data set includes information about the ceramic type, part of the ceramic (body or glaze), and the percentage of various chemical compounds present in the ceramic, such as sodium oxide, magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, potassium oxide, calcium oxide, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, manganese oxide, copper oxide, zinc oxide, lead oxide, rubidium oxide, strontium oxide, yttrium oxide, zirconium oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide.

**Attribute Information**

* Ceramic Name: the name of the ceramic type from Longquan and Jingdezhen
* Part: a binary categorical variable indicating whether the sample is from the body or glaze of the ceramic
* Chemical Composition: the percentage of various chemical compounds present in the ceramic

**Dataset Information**

The Chemical Composition of Ceramic Samples Data Set is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists studying the chemical composition of ceramics and its relationship to cultural eras and kilns. The data set has no missing values and is available for public use.
