QSAR-TID-10982 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10982. The dataset has six hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin three receptor. The Neurokinin three receptor is a single protein, also known as Neurokinin B receptor, Neuromedin-K receptor, NK three R, and NK-three receptor. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor family, and short peptide receptor family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project involves the collection and curation of QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL, and the generation of molecular fingerprints using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The Neurokinin three receptor is a target for several compounds, including ELINZANETANT, PAVINETANT, TALNETANT, and FEZOLINETANT, which are small molecules that act as Neurokinin three receptor antagonists. These compounds have been tested in various phases, including phase three, and have shown potential as therapeutic agents.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It can be used to develop predictive models of Neurokinin three receptor activity, and to identify new compounds with potential therapeutic activity.
