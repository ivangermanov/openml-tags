QSAR-TID-10982 Dataset 

Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10982. It has six hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
