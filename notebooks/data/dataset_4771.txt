Energy Efficiency

This dataset assesses the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings, which is essential for evaluating energy efficiency, as a function of various building parameters. An energy analysis was performed using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. These buildings differ in terms of their glazing area, glazing area distribution, and orientation, among other key parameters. To obtain a comprehensive understanding, various settings were simulated as functions of these characteristics, resulting in seven hundred sixty-eight building shapes.

The attributes in this dataset describe different properties of the building. There is the relative compactness, which refers to how compact the building is in relation to its size. Another important attribute is the surface area, which is the total exterior area of the building. The wall area and roof area are also included, providing information about the building's envelope. Additionally, the overall height of the building is an essential factor. The orientation of the building, which affects how much sunlight it receives, is also considered. Furthermore, the glazing area and glazing area distribution are crucial aspects, as they impact the amount of heat and light that enters the building.

Two possible options for target features are the heating load and cooling load, which are critical indicators of a building's energy efficiency. The heating load represents the amount of energy required to heat the building, while the cooling load indicates the energy needed to cool it.

This dataset consists of seven hundred sixty-eight samples and eight features, aiming to predict two real-valued responses. Alternatively, it can be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.
