The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is widely used for data generation due to its ability to simulate real-world complexities.

The original Friedman function consists of five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity.

Colinearity refers to the number of features depending on other features. The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values vary in terms of the number of features, samples, and colinearity degrees.

The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are randomly generated. The number of samples also varies, ranging from one hundred to one thousand. Furthermore, the colinearity degrees range from zero to four, with higher degrees indicating stronger dependencies between features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.
