Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

Original Description:

We collected information on various variables using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. In this sample, a block group on average includes individuals living in a geographically compact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. We computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. We excluded all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. The final data contained observations on nine variables. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the median house value.

The following variables were found to be significant predictors of the median house value: Median Income, which has a positive effect; Median Income squared, which has a negative effect; Median Income cubed, which has a very slight negative effect; the natural logarithm of the Median Age, which has a positive effect; the natural logarithm of the Total Rooms per Population, which has a negative effect; the natural logarithm of the Bedrooms per Population, which has a positive effect; the natural logarithm of the Population per Households, which has a negative effect; and the natural logarithm of the number of Households, which has a slight positive effect.
