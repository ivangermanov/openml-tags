QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Human immunodeficiency virus type protease, also known as pol Pol polyprotein. This target is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Aspartic protease/Aspartic protease AA clan/Aspartic protease AA subfamily. It is associated with Human immunodeficiency virus and belongs to the Species Group.

Several compounds in the dataset target this protease, including darunavir, saquinavir, telinavir, brecanavir, and amprenavir. These are small molecule inhibitors of HIV protease, with some having reached advanced clinical phases and received regulatory approval. The compounds typically have names ending in "vir" and act by inhibiting the viral protease essential for HIV replication.

The target protein is associated with multiple Gene Ontology terms, including aspartic type endopeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and proteolysis. It is also linked to various protein databases and classification systems such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.

This QSAR dataset provides valuable information for studying HIV protease inhibitors and developing potential new antiviral therapies. The molecular fingerprint features allow for detailed analysis of structure activity relationships among the compounds targeting this crucial viral enzyme.
