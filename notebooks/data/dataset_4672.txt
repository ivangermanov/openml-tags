Fashion MNIST Seed Two Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains forty-one thousand nine hundred ninety-six instances. The subsampling process involved selecting a random two thousand instances using a specific seed value, resulting in a reduced dataset.

The subsampled dataset has ten classes, which were uniformly sampled from the original classes. The sampling process ensured that each class had an equal probability of being selected, based on its frequency in the original dataset.

In addition to reducing the number of instances, the dataset also underwent column sampling. The goal was to reduce the number of columns to a maximum of one hundred. This was achieved by randomly selecting columns, ensuring that the selection was uniform across all columns.

Stratification played a crucial role in the sampling process, particularly when reducing the number of instances. This involved splitting the data into training and testing sets, while ensuring that each set maintained the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of features, including pixel values from various locations in the images. These features were carefully selected to represent the most informative aspects of the data.
