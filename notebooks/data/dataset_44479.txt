Amazon Commerce Reviews Seed One Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Amazon Commerce Reviews dataset, generated with a seed of one. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset.

The dataset has been stratified to ensure that the class distribution is maintained. The subsampling process selected ten classes from the original dataset, and then uniformly sampled columns and rows to create a dataset with one hundred columns and two thousand rows.

The features of this dataset include product reviews and ratings, with a focus on the text of the reviews. The dataset has been processed to convert categorical columns to strings, making it suitable for use with OpenML.

The dataset is a subset of the original Amazon Commerce Reviews dataset, which contains a large collection of product reviews and ratings from Amazon. This subsampled dataset is designed to be more manageable for machine learning experiments, while still maintaining the diversity and complexity of the original dataset.
