The YouTube Personality Dataset consists of a collection of behavioral features, speech transcriptions, and personality impression scores for a set of YouTube vloggers who explicitly show themselves in front of a webcam, talking about a wide range of topics including personal issues, politics, movies, books, and more. There is no content-related restriction, and the language used in the videos is natural and diverse.

The dataset includes various features, such as pitch, confidence in pitch, spectral entropy, amplitude peak, energy, and voiced segment characteristics, which provide insights into the speakers' vocal patterns and behaviors. Additionally, it includes features related to the speakers' speaking style, such as time spent speaking, voice rate, and number of turns, as well as visual features like facial expressions and body language.

The dataset also includes personality impression scores, which are categorized into five broad dimensions: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness to Experience.
