The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game. 

In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. 

In this case, there are four attributes: Outlook, which describes the overall weather condition; Temperature, which measures how hot or cold it is; Humidity, which describes the amount of moisture in the air; and Windy, which indicates if it is breezy or still. 

The outcome is whether to Play or Not, depending on how favorable these conditions are for engaging in the activity.

Features: Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Windy, Play
