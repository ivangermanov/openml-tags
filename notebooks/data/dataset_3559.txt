This dataset, Crystal System Properties for Lithium-Ion Batteries, contains data about the physical and chemical properties of lithium-ion silicate cathodes. These properties can be useful in predicting the class of a lithium-ion battery, which can be classified based on its crystal system. There are three major classes of crystal systems, including monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic.

The dataset provides a range of features that can be used to train a machine learning model to predict the class of a lithium-ion battery. These features include material identification, formula, space group, formation energy, energy above hull, band gap, number of sites, density, volume, whether the material has a band structure, and its crystal system.

With this dataset, one can explore different classification algorithms to predict the class of a lithium-ion battery based on its crystal system. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can classify new, unseen data into one of the three major classes of crystal systems.
