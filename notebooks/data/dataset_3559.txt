QSAR-TID-10489 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10489. It has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The drug target, also known as the Calcium Sensing Receptor, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. It is primarily involved in the detection of calcium ions and the maintenance of intracellular calcium ion homeostasis.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the parathyroid gland, kidney, and brain, and is responsible for regulating calcium levels in the blood. Dysregulation of this receptor has been implicated in various diseases, including hyperparathyroidism and osteoporosis.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers studying the structure-activity relationships of compounds targeting this receptor, and can be used to develop predictive models for identifying novel ligands.

Keywords: QSAR, Calcium Sensing Receptor, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR project, structure-activity relationships.
