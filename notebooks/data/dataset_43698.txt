Pakistan's Migration History
Tags: Context

Every year, a significant number of people migrate to different countries from Pakistan, while a substantial number of emigrants and refugees also migrate to Pakistan. In fact, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Pakistan ranks second among the countries that host the most refugees. This dataset serves as a tribute to Pakistan and aims to inform the world that Pakistan is quite different from what people may think.

The dataset provides information on the migration patterns of people entering or leaving Pakistan to settle down and start their new life. A negative value indicates that more people are entering Pakistan than exiting, while a positive value indicates the opposite.

Acknowledgments
