Pakistan's Migration History
Context:
Every year, a significant number of individuals migrate to various countries from Pakistan, while many others migrate to Pakistan as emigrants or refugees. In fact, Pakistan ranks second, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), among the countries hosting the largest number of refugees. This serves as a tribute to Pakistan and provides insight to the world that Pakistan is quite different from what one might think.

Content:
Annually, people either enter or leave Pakistan to settle down and begin a new chapter in their lives. When we examine the migration trends, we find that a negative value indicates that more individuals are entering Pakistan than exiting, whereas a positive value suggests the opposite.
