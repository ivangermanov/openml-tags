The Medical Appointment dataset is a significant collection of data that aims to tackle the pressing issue of no-shows in the healthcare industry, where approximately thirty percent of patients fail to attend their scheduled appointments. This dataset, which spans from January 1st to April 30th, comprises 61,000 points and nineteen features that can be leveraged to predict patient behavior.

The dataset includes a range of features that provide insights into the patient's demographics, appointment details, and creation process. For instance, the specialty of the doctor, the patient's age, and sex are all included. The month, day, and hour of the appointment are also captured, along with the corresponding continuous values. Similarly, the month, day, and hour when the appointment was created are recorded, providing a comprehensive understanding of the appointment scheduling process.

Additionally, the dataset includes features such as the latency period between the appointment and its creation, the channel used to create the appointment, and the type of appointment. The ultimate goal is to utilize these features to predict whether a patient will show up for their appointment, which is denoted by the "show" feature.
