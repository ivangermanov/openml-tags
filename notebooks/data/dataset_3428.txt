QSAR-TID-12128 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12128. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Neprilysin protein, which is a single protein target with the preferred name Atriopeptidase. It has several synonyms, including CD ten, Enkephalinase, Mme, and NEP. The protein is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, and metallo protease M thirteen family.

The Neprilysin protein is involved in various biological processes, including kidney development, placenta development, proteolysis, peptide metabolic process, and learning or memory. It is also involved in the response to estrogen and the regulation of neurogenesis.

The dataset is associated with several cross-references, including Expression Atlas, GO Component, GO Function, GO Process, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
