This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10360, belongs to the categories of Government and MTLQSAR, and is part of the study three. It was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, which shows activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 10360. There are one hundred fifty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other features that are represented by FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is related to the histamine H four receptor, which is a single protein preferred name, also known as H four R, HH four R, histamine H four receptor, and Hrh four. It belongs to the species group of Rattus norvegicus, and its protein target classification is one point membrane receptor slash family A G protein-coupled receptor slash small molecule receptor.

The description of this receptor is related to plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, and synapse. Its functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, histamine receptor activity, G protein-coupled serotonin receptor activity, and G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor activity.

The biological processes associated with this receptor include inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and many others. It is also related to several pathways, including histamine receptors, G alpha i signaling events, and adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, histamine H4 receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, inflammatory response, signal transduction.
