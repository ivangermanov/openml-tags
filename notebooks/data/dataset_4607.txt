Sub-sampling of the dataset segment with a seed equals two arguments. The sub-sampling function generates a dataset by randomly selecting a specified number of rows, columns, and classes from the original dataset while maintaining the original class distribution.

The function first selects a specified number of unique classes from the dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are representative of the original class distribution. It then selects the corresponding rows where these classes are present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, ensuring that the selected columns are representative of the original column distribution. Finally, the function applies stratified sampling to select a specified number of rows while maintaining the original class distribution.

The resulting sub-sampled dataset is then returned along with its corresponding metadata, including the column names and categorical mask.
