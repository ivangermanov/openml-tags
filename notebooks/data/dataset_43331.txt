The Austin Weather dataset is designed to complement the Austin Bikesharing dataset. It contains a wealth of information about various weather conditions, which can be used to analyze and understand the impact of weather on bike sharing patterns.

This comprehensive dataset includes a range of weather-related features, including high, average, and low temperatures, dew points, humidity levels, sea level pressures, visibility, wind speeds, and precipitation sums. Additionally, it also records any adverse weather events that may have occurred on a particular day.

The dataset spans a significant period of time, covering every day from December twenty-first to July thirty-first. The data has been sourced from Weather Underground, specifically from the Austin KATT station.

One potential application of this dataset is to explore how different weather conditions affect bike sharing behavior. For instance, do people tend to cycle more on warm sunny days? Do strong winds or heavy rainfall deter cyclists? By analyzing this dataset alongside the Austin Bikesharing dataset, researchers may uncover valuable insights into these questions.
