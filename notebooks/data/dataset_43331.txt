This dataset is meant to complement the Austin Bike Sharing Dataset.

The content of this dataset contains the date, high temperature, average temperature, low temperature, high dew point, average dew point, low dew point, high humidity, average humidity, low humidity, high sea level pressure, average sea level pressure, low sea level pressure, high visibility, average visibility, low visibility, high wind speed, average wind speed, highest wind speed gust, total precipitation, and adverse weather events.

The high temperature, average temperature, and low temperature are all measured in Fahrenheit. The high dew point, average dew point, and low dew point are also measured in Fahrenheit. The high humidity, average humidity, and low humidity are measured as a percentage. The high sea level pressure, average sea level pressure, and low sea level pressure are measured in inches. The high visibility, average visibility, and low visibility are measured in miles. The high wind speed, average wind speed, and highest wind speed gust are measured in miles per hour. The total precipitation is measured in inches.

This dataset contains data for every date from the start of the dataset to the end of the dataset.

The dataset was obtained from Weather Underground, at the Austin KATT station.

This dataset can be used to explain some of the variation in the Austin Bike Sharing Dataset.

Keywords: weather, temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, visibility, sea level pressure, adverse weather events, bike sharing.
