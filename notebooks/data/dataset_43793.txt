League of Legends Context Dataset

Tags: Context

As a passionate Russian League of Legends player, I have immense admiration for the League of Legends Continental League (LCL) and wanted to create a comprehensive dataset linked to the data from this esteemed league.

The dataset comprises match data, meticulously documenting all the regular season games of the split, including tiebreakers, but excluding playoffs and spring/summer splits.

The data was meticulously collected from the reliable source, Gamepedia.

The dataset features include Team One, Team Two, Winner, UTC Time, Blue Side, Red Side, and Most Valuable Player.
