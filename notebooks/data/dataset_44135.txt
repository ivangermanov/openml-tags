ISOLET 

Tags: Chemistry, Machine Learning 

Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way, belonging to the regression on numerical features benchmark.

The ISOLET dataset was generated as follows: one hundred fifty subjects spoke the name of each letter of the alphabet twice. Hence, there are fifty-two training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of thirty speakers each, four groups serving as the training set, and the last group serving as the test set. A total of three examples were missing, which the authors dropped due to difficulties in recording.

This dataset is suitable for a noisy, perceptual task. It is also an excellent domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms. For instance, the C4.5 algorithm on this domain is slower than backpropagation!

All attributes are continuous, real-valued attributes scaled into the range minus one point zero to one point zero. The features include spectral coefficients, contour features, sonorant features, pre-sonorant features, and post-sonorant features.

Relevant papers discuss spoken letter recognition and error-correcting output codes for improving multiclass inductive learning programs.
