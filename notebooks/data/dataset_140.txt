1985 Auto Imports Database 

This dataset consists of three types of entities: the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, its assigned insurance risk rating, and its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. 

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky or less, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up or down the scale. Actuarians call this process symboling. A value of plus three indicates that the auto is risky, minus three that it is probably pretty safe. 

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification, such as two-door small, station wagons, sports/specialty, etcetera, and represents the average loss per car per year.

This dataset has been used previously to predict the price of a car using all numeric and boolean attributes. An instance-based learning algorithm derived from a localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used. This method was compared to a linear regression prediction, so all instances with missing attribute values were discarded. This resulted in a training set of one hundred fifty-nine instances, which was also used as a test set minus the actual instance during testing.

The results showed a percent average deviation error of prediction from actual of eleven point eighty-four percent for the instance-based learning algorithm and fourteen point one two percent for the resulting linear regression equation.

The dataset contains twenty-six attributes, including fifteen continuous, one integer, and ten nominal attributes. There are two hundred five instances in total.
