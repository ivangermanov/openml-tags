Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

This is a smaller version of the original dataset, containing a large number of rows. The dataset is related to Higgs Boson detection data, which has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. These features include properties such as lepton momentum, lepton direction, and missing energy. The last seven features are functions of the first twenty-one features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features.

The dataset has a class label, which is categorical, not numeric. The class label is the first column, where one represents signal and zero represents background. The dataset is divided into two parts, where the last part is used as a test set.

The dataset contains a total of twenty-eight features. The first twenty-one features are low-level features, which are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are high-level features derived by physicists.

The dataset is related to the search for exotic particles in high-energy physics using deep learning. The dataset is useful for developing and testing deep learning models that can help physicists in their search for new particles.
