QSAR-TID-261 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 261. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Prostanoid EP1 receptor, which is a single protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes.

The Prostanoid EP1 receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in the regulation of inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. The receptor is activated by prostaglandin E2, which is a lipid-like ligand.

The dataset contains multiple compounds that have been tested for their activity on the Prostanoid EP1 receptor. The activity values are represented as pseudo-pCI50, which is a measure of the compound's potency. The dataset also includes features that represent the molecular structure of the compounds, which can be used to develop QSAR models.

The Prostanoid EP1 receptor is an important drug target for the treatment of various diseases, including inflammatory disorders and cancer. The development of QSAR models for this receptor can facilitate the discovery of new drugs that target this receptor.
