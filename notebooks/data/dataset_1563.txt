Data Set Information:
This dataset consists of emails collected from the DBWorld newsletter. These emails were used to train various algorithms for classifying between 'conference announcements' and 'all other content'. The data representation utilizes a binary bag of words approach, with stopword removal applied as a preprocessing step.

Attribute Information:
Each attribute corresponds to a specific word or stem found in the complete dataset vocabulary. The bag of words representation was employed for this purpose.
