QSAR-TID-168 Dataset: Health, Medicine, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 168. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

The dataset contains molecular fingerprints, which do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

Features include molecular ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty.
