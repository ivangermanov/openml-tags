**DB World Subjects Stemmed**

The DB World Emails dataset was collected from sixty-four emails from the DB World newsletter. The purpose of this dataset is to train algorithms to classify between announcements of conferences and everything else.

The dataset uses a binary bag-of-words representation with a stopword removal pre-processing task. Each attribute corresponds to a specific word or stem in the entire dataset vocabulary.

The dataset was created to explore email classification using a very small corpus. The project aimed to develop machine learning models capable of distinguishing between conference announcements and other types of emails.

Relevant papers on this topic include research on email classification using a very small corpus, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of working with limited datasets.

Keywords: email classification, conference announcements, machine learning, dataset, bag-of-words representation.
