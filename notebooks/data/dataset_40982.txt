Steel Plates Faults Data Set

This dataset consists of steel plates' faults, classified into seven different types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition. The dataset consists of twenty-seven features describing each fault, such as location and size, and one feature indicating the type of fault, which is one of seven: Pastry, Z Scratch, K Scratch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, or Other Faults. The target is the type of fault.

Attribute Information:

The features describe the characteristics of each fault, including the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, pixels areas, perimeters, sum of luminosity, minimum and maximum of luminosity, length of conveyer, type of steel, steel plate thickness, edges index, empty index, square index, outside x index, edges x index, edges y index, outside global index, log of areas, log x index, log y index, orientation index, luminosity index, and sigmoid of areas.

Relevant Papers:

The dataset has been used in research papers, including a new meta-classifier and a theory of independent judges.

Features:

The dataset includes twenty-seven features, including minimum and maximum coordinates, pixels areas, perimeters, luminosity, and various indices.

Target:

The target variable is the type of fault, which is one of seven categories.

Keywords: steel plates, faults, pattern recognition, machine learning, classification.
