Original training test consists of first instances. Features include various genetic markers and expression data, such as Bio, CreX, human alu, DapX, LysX, PheX, ThrX, TrpnX, HUMISGF A/M, HUMRGE/M, HUMGAPDH/M, HSAC/X, HUMTFRR/M, and many others.

This dataset focuses on the molecular classification of leukemia through gene expression monitoring. It aims to discover and predict cancer classes using advanced genetic analysis techniques. The study utilizes a comprehensive array of genetic markers and expression data to identify patterns and distinctions between different types of leukemia. This research contributes to the field of cancer genomics and has potential implications for personalized medicine and targeted therapies in leukemia treatment.
