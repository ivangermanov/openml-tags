Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Base salary, Salary, Sex, Seniority, Age, Education, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Sleuth Case, is a modified version of an original dataset from an unknown source. The modification process involved binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset includes various features related to employment and demographics, such as base salary, sex, seniority, age, and education level. The binary classification feature serves as the target variable for analysis or prediction tasks. Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation and acknowledge its binarized nature compared to the original version.
