Sleuth Case Dataset

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the numeric target feature and then assigning a classification of Positive to all instances with a target value below the mean, and Negative to those above it. This resulted in a two-class nominal target feature.

Features of this dataset include basic salary, seventy-seven salary, female sex, seniority, age, education level, and binary class.
