The Weather Problem is a tiny dataset that we will use repeatedly to illustrate machine learning methods. Entirely fictitious, it supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified game. In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. In this case, there are four attributes that describe the weather conditions: the outlook, whether it is sunny or cloudy, the temperature, which can be hot or cold, the humidity, which can be high or low, and whether it is windy or not. The outcome is whether to play the game or not, depending on these weather conditions.

Features: outlook, temperature, humidity, windy, play

Keywords: Weather Problem, machine learning, dataset, weather conditions, game, outlook, temperature, humidity, windy.
