Name: QSAR Biodeg Seed Two Subsample

Tags: Subsampling of the QSAR Biodeg dataset with seed equals two

This dataset is a subsample of the QSAR Biodeg dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of classes to ensure a maximum number of classes. The selected classes were chosen based on their frequency in the original dataset.

The subsample also involved uniformly sampling columns from the original dataset, selecting a subset of columns to ensure a maximum number of columns. The selected columns were chosen randomly from the original dataset.

The subsample was further reduced by uniformly sampling rows from the resulting dataset, selecting a subset of rows to ensure a maximum number of rows. This sampling was done in a stratified manner to ensure that the class distribution was preserved.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including V One, V Two, V Three, V Four, V Five, V Six, V Seven, V Eight, V Nine, V Ten, V Eleven, V Twelve, V Thirteen, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Sixteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, V Twenty-Two, V Twenty-Three, V Twenty-Four, V Twenty-Five, V Twenty-Six, V Twenty-Seven, V Twenty-Eight, V Twenty-Nine, V Thirty, V Thirty-One, V Thirty-Two, V Thirty-Three, V Thirty-Four, V Thirty-Five, V Thirty-Six, V Thirty-Seven, V Thirty-Eight, V Thirty-Nine, V Forty, V Forty-One, and Class.
