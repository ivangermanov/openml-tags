The Triazines dataset involves learning a regression equation or rule to predict the activity from descriptive structural attributes. This problem is well-suited for exploring the application of machine learning algorithms.

A detailed description of the data and methodology used in this dataset can be found in two publications: A Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Methods for Modeling QSARs and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships by Neural Networks and Inductive Logic Programming.

The original source of the dataset is unknown, but it was collected and made available by Luis Torgo on his website.

This dataset consists of 186 cases, each characterized by sixty-one continuous variables. While these variable names are not easily interpretable, they describe various properties of the molecules being studied.

The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the activity based on these molecular characteristics.
