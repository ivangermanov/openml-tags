This dataset, named BNG (trains), is an artificial dataset focused on train configurations. It includes various features related to train composition, such as the number of cars, different types of loads, wheel counts, and train length. The dataset also captures information about the shapes of train cars and their loads, as well as the spatial relationships between different car shapes (e.g., rectangle next to triangle, hexagon next to circle). This comprehensive set of features allows for detailed analysis and modeling of train configurations and their characteristics.
