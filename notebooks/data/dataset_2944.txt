This dataset contains, for each Premier League match, the probabilities generated with the Learning to Forecast models, as well as match odds. It provides a comprehensive analysis of each game, including the probability of the home team winning, the probability of a draw, and the probability of the away team emerging victorious.

The dataset includes various features, such as the identity of the home team and the away team, the number of goals scored by each team, and the odds offered by bookmakers, specifically Bet365, for a home win, a draw, and an away win.

The Learning to Forecast models used to generate these probabilities take into account a range of factors, including the strengths and weaknesses of each team, their past performance, and other relevant data. The resulting probabilities provide valuable insights for football fans, pundits, and gamblers alike.
