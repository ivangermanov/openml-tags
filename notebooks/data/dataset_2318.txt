This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero five four eight, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains information about a specific protein target, namely the C-C chemokine receptor type three, which is a single protein that belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. It is primarily involved in the process of chemotaxis and plays a crucial role in the immune response.

The protein target classification for this receptor is one point zero, membrane receptor, family A G-protein coupled receptor, peptide receptor, chemokine receptor, and C-C chemokine receptor.

The description of this protein target highlights its involvement in various biological processes, including positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, cellular defense response, cell adhesion, signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-modulating G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, calcium-mediated signaling, and positive regulation of angiogenesis.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, chemokine receptor, G-protein coupled receptor, immune response, chemotaxis, inflammation.
