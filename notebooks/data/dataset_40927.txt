CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of the eighty million tiny images dataset. It originally consisted of thirty-two by thirty-two color images representing ten classes of objects: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. CIFAR-10 contains six thousand images per class. The original train-test split randomly divided these into five thousand train and one thousand test images per class. The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. Automobile includes sedans, sport utility vehicles, and similar types of vehicles. Truck includes only large trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.

Each instance represents a thirty-two by thirty-two color image as an array. The first portion of the array contains the red channel values, the next portion the green, and the final portion the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first portion of the array is the red channel values of the first row of the image. The labels are encoded as integers corresponding to the numbered classes listed above.
