CIFAR 10 is a labeled subset of the eighty million tiny images dataset. It originally consists of thirty-two by thirty-two color images representing ten classes of objects: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. CIFAR 10 contains images per class. The original train-test split randomly divided these into train and test images per class. The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. Automobile includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. Truck includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.

Each instance represents a thirty-two by thirty-two color image as an array. The first entries contain the red channel values, the next the green, and the final the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image. The labels are encoded as integers, corresponding to the numbered classes listed above.
