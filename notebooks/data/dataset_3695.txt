This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand five. It has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and machine learning applications. The data was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and includes activity values in terms of pseudo-pCI fifty units.

The drug target, serine threonine protein kinase seventeen B, is a single protein that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group and DAPK family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, and intracellular signal transduction.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, drug target, serine threonine protein kinase, MetaQSAR project, ChEMBL.
