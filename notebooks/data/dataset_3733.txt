QSAR-TID-11622 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11622. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that encodes the structural information of a molecule into a binary string. The fingerprints are generated using the FCFP algorithm, which is a widely used method for generating molecular fingerprints.

The dataset contains a total of features, including the molecule ChEMBL ID and the median PXc50 value. The median PXc50 value is a measure of the activity of a compound against a particular drug target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for the drug target TID: 11622, which can be used to develop predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.
