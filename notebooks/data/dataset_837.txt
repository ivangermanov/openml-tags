The Fri_c1 Dataset is a binarized regression problem related to Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is a modified version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset contains various features, including forty-nine attributes denoted by Oz One to Oz Forty-Nine. The Binary Class feature is used for classification purposes.
