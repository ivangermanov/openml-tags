The Balance Scale Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting 

This dataset has been binarized from its original form. In this new format, the multi-class target feature has been transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

Features of this dataset include the weight and distance measurements for both the left and right sides of the scale.
