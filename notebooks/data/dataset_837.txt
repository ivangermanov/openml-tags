Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled oz one through oz fifty, along with a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification task. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean threshold, respectively.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies and appears to be part of a larger research effort involving mythbusting and various analytical approaches. While the original source and date of creation are unknown, it is clear that this dataset is a modified version of a previously existing dataset, specifically designed to facilitate binary classification tasks.

Researchers utilizing this dataset should be aware of its binarized nature and consider the implications of this transformation when interpreting results or comparing findings to those obtained from the original, non-binarized version of the data.
