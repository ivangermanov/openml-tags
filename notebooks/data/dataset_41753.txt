Data Description:
This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex USD/CAD currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a single day's worth of data, comprising one candlestick.

The timestamp feature is based on the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent day, relative to the mean high price of the current day. Specifically, the class attribute is labeled as true if the mean high price is expected to rise in the following day, and false otherwise, indicating either a decline or stagnation in the mean high price.
