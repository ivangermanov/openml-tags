**Energy Efficiency**

**Data Description**

This dataset assesses the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings, which is a crucial aspect of energy efficiency, as a function of various building parameters. To achieve this, energy analysis is performed using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. Various settings as functions of these characteristics are simulated to obtain a large number of building shapes.

**Attribute Description**

All features in this dataset describe different properties of the building. These properties include the relative compactness of the building, its surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. The heating load and cooling load are two possible options for target features.

The dataset comprises a large number of samples and eight features, aiming to predict two real-valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

**Dataset Information**

The dataset contains eight attributes and two responses. The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. Specifically, the features are relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution, while the responses are heating load and cooling load.

**Additional Information**

The dataset does not have any missing values.
