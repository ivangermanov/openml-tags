Entering a cognitive state of flow is a natural response of the mind that allows people to fully concentrate and cope with tedious and often repetitive tasks. Understanding how to trigger or sustain flow remains limited by retrospective surveys, presenting a need to better document flow. This dataset, BraidFlow, is used to study flow in the context of a flow-inducing task, namely braid making. Using an instrumented Kumihimo braid making tool and off-the-shelf biosignal wristbands, we record the experiences of users engaged in different braid making tasks. We extract features motivated from flow literature from activity data, including movement, muscle activity, skin conductance, heart rate, and skin temperature, as well as braiding telemetry, and annotate them with Flow Short Scale scores.

The features include user identification, task identification, action absorption, action accord, action fluidity, care, challenge match, clear-mindedness, control, demand, factor absorption by activity, factor fluency of performance, factor perceived fit of skill and task demands, factor subjective value of activity, focus, forward thinking, Flow Short Scale score, loss of time perception, lost in thought, perceived difficulty, relevance, self-evaluation, worry, task braid, task braid revolutions, task braid strands, and various braiding statistics.

Additionally, the dataset includes features related to disk acceleration, disk speed, disk flips, disk heading movements, and disk heading rhythm, as well as wristband acceleration, wristband speed, heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity.
