The jEdit dataset is associated with several studies and research initiatives, including those focused on mythbusting and software quality assessment. It is part of the PROMISE repository, which contains datasets for empirical software engineering research. The dataset includes various object-oriented metrics that are commonly used to evaluate software complexity and quality. These metrics provide insights into different aspects of the software's structure and behavior, such as inheritance depth, coupling, cohesion, and overall size. The bug count feature allows researchers to correlate these metrics with the occurrence of defects in the software, potentially leading to improved prediction models and development practices.
