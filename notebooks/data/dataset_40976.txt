**Bike Database**

This data contains the bike example from Automatically Finding the Control Variables for Complex System Behavior. The dataset consists of various features that describe the performance of a bike ride. The last two columns are derived from the others. The second last column represents the noise, or variance, on the power and should be minimized. The last column shows a cluster number for each row, which was generated via unsupervised learning, working on all columns except the last two.

The features of this dataset include Power, Distance, Heart Rate, Speed, Wind Speed, Cadence, Elevation, Hill Slope, and Temperature. Additionally, there is a Penalty column, which is to be minimized, and a Cluster column, which was found by unsupervised learning.
