The Bike Database is a collection of data that contains the bike example from Automatically Finding the Control Variables for Complex System Behavior. 

This database consists of various attributes related to biking, including power output, distance traveled, heart rate, speed, wind speed, cadence, elevation, hill slope, and temperature. 

The goal is to minimize the penalty, which is the variance on the power output. The last column represents a cluster number assigned to each row, generated through unsupervised learning using all columns except the last two.
