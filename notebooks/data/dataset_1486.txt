The Nomao dataset contains information about places (name, phone, localization, etc.) collected from various sources. The primary task is deduplication, which involves detecting when different data entries refer to the same place. Each instance in the dataset compares two spots.

This dataset was enriched during the Nomao Challenge, organized in conjunction with the Active Learning in Real world Applications workshop at the ECML PKDD conference. It consists of instances labeled by human experts, with a mix of continuous and nominal attributes.

The dataset comprises instances labeled with "human prior" as well as instances labeled using various active learning methods such as "marg," "wmarg," "wmarg," "rand" (random selection), "baseline," "nomao," and "tsun." These different labeling methods were employed during the challenge to explore various approaches to the deduplication task.

There are attributes in total, including continuous and nominal features. The features cover various aspects of place information, including name similarity, address components, geographic coordinates, and contact details. Similarity measures such as intersection, Levenshtein distance, and trigram similarity are used to compare different fields between the two spots being evaluated.

Labels in the dataset are either plus one if the concerned spots should be merged, or minus one if they do not refer to the same entity. Missing data is allowed and represented by question marks.

The dataset is characterized as univariate and falls within the computer science domain. It is primarily used for classification tasks and includes real valued attributes. The presence of missing values adds an additional layer of complexity to the data analysis process.

This dataset is part of several collections and studies, including OpenML CC, OpenML, and various other research initiatives. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on deduplication, entity resolution, and active learning problems in real world scenarios.
