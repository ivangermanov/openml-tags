This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Ghrelin Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Ghrelin Receptor, which is also known as Ghrelin Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor. This receptor is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms include Ghrelin Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor and Short Peptide Receptor family A GPCR.

The receptor is classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR GRP related receptor. It is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, actin polymerization or depolymerization, adult feeding behavior, response to hormone, hormone mediated signaling pathway, growth hormone secretion, response to food, positive regulation of appetite, negative regulation of interleukin one beta production, negative regulation of interleukin six production, negative regulation of tumor necrosis factor production, cellular response to insulin stimulus, positive regulation of multicellular organism growth, positive regulation of insulin like growth factor receptor signaling pathway, decidualization, insulin like growth factor receptor signaling pathway, negative regulation of inflammatory response, and regulation of synapse assembly.
