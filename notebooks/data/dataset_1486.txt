Nomao Data Set

The Nomao data set collects information about various places, including their names, phone numbers, and localizations, from multiple sources. The primary goal of this data set is to detect duplicate entries, which refer to the same location. Each instance in the data set compares two different spots.

Data Set Characteristics:
The Nomao data set is univariate and belongs to the computer science domain. It contains real-valued attributes and is suitable for classification tasks. This data set also contains missing values.

Data Set Information:
The Nomao data set consists of thirty-four thousand four hundred sixty-five instances, which are a mix of continuous and nominal values. These instances are labeled by human experts. The first twenty-nine thousand one hundred four instances were labeled using human prior knowledge. The remaining instances were labeled using different active learning methods, including marg, wmarg, wmarg five, rand, baseline, nomao, and tsun.

Attribute Information:
This data set contains one hundred twenty attributes, out of which eighty-nine are continuous, and thirty-one are nominal. These attributes include the label and id. Missing data are represented by question marks. The labels are plus one if the spots being compared should be merged, and minus one if they do not refer to the same entity.

The first attribute is the id, which is a combination of the names of the compared spots separated by a sharp symbol. The remaining attributes are divided into categories based on the type of information, such as clean name, city, zip, street, website, country name, geocoder locality name, geocoder input address, geocoder output address, geocoder postal code number, geocoder country name code, phone, fax, street number, geocode coordinates long, geocode coordinates lat, coordinates long, coordinates lat, geocode coordinates difference, and coordinates difference.
