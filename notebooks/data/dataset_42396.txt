The Multiclass from Binary dataset is an expansion of the one-versus-all, one-versus-one, and ECOC-based approaches. This dataset is taken from LIBSVM, a popular machine learning library, and can be accessed through the following link: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html. 

In this dataset version, the target attribute is fixed and is given as a nominal feature. The dataset consists of various features, which are not human-readable. 

The Multiclass from Binary dataset is cited in the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, a renowned journal in the field of machine learning.
