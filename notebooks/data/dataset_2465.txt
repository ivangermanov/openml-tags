The Run or Walk Information Dataset 

Tags: Concept Drift, Education, Sport, Statistics, Time Series, Tuesday 

This dataset has been gathered to detect whether a person is running or walking based on deep neural networks and sensor data collected from iOS devices. 

The dataset represents sensor data samples collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope from iPhone devices in ten-second intervals and a certain frequency. 

Attribute Information 

This data is represented by the following columns, each containing sensor data for one of the sensor's axes: 
Acceleration along the X-axis 
Acceleration along the Y-axis 
Acceleration along the Z-axis 
Gyroscope measurement along the X-axis 
Gyroscope measurement along the Y-axis 
Gyroscope measurement along the Z-axis 

There is an activity type represented by the Activity column, which acts as a label and reflects the following activities: 
Walking 
Running 

The original data also contains a Wrist column, which represents the wrist where the device was placed, and Date, Time, and Username columns, which provide information about the exact date, time, and user who collected these measurements.
