The QSAR-TID-8 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL, also known as Abelson Murine Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog One. It consists of 1739 rows and 1026 features, including molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically designed for machine learning modeling and analysis. The molecular fingerprints used in this dataset are FCFP six bit molecular fingerprints, which represent the presence or absence of specific substructures within a molecule.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is a key player in the development of certain types of cancer, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia.

The inhibition of Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating these diseases. Several small molecules have been identified as inhibitors of this enzyme, including bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and flumatinib.

In addition to its role in cancer, Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL has also been implicated in other biological processes, such as neuronal development and function, immune response, and DNA repair.
