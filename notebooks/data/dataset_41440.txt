The OkCupid-stem dataset is a collection of user profile data for San Francisco OkCupid users, published in a research paper. The curated dataset was downloaded from a GitHub repository. The original dataset was created using a Python script that pulled data from public profiles on OkCupid.com on a specific date. It includes individuals within a twenty-five-mile radius of San Francisco who were online in the last year, with at least one profile picture. Permission to use this data was obtained under the condition that the dataset remains public.

As the target variable, the job category was collapsed into three categories: STEM, non-STEM, and student. STEM jobs were defined as those related to computer hardware software, science, technology, and engineering. Observations with unemployed, retired, or rather not say job categories, or missing values in the job category, were removed. The original dataset also included open text variables, which were removed from the uploaded dataset. The dataset further includes a date and time variable, last online, which could be used to construct additional features.

Using OkCupid data for predicting STEM jobs was inspired by a book on feature engineering and selection for predictive models. The dataset includes various features, such as age, body type, diet, drinking habits, drug use, education, ethnicity, height, income, job category, location, offspring, orientation, pets, religion, sex, star sign, smoking habits, language spoken, and relationship status.
