Context
It is of paramount importance that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions with a high degree of accuracy, thereby ensuring that customers are not unfairly charged for items or services they did not purchase.

Content
The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred over a period of two days, where a small fraction of the transactions, namely frauds, account for a tiny proportion of all transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class, which represents fraudulent transactions, making up a very small percentage of all transactions. The dataset contains only numerical input variables, which are the result of a Principal Component Analysis transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data.

Features
The dataset includes the Time feature, which contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The Amount feature represents the transaction amount, which can be used, for example, for cost-sensitive learning. The Class feature is the response variable and takes a value of one in case of fraud and zero otherwise.
