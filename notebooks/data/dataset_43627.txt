Credit Card Fraud Detection

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

It is crucial for credit card companies to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions in order to prevent customers from being charged for items they did not purchase. This is essential for maintaining trust and security in online transactions.

The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset contains transactions made by European credit card holders in September 2013. The dataset spans two days, during which a total of fraudulent transactions were recorded out of all transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for a small proportion of all transactions.

The dataset contains only numerical input variables, which are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features and additional background information about the data cannot be disclosed.

The dataset includes features such as Time, which represents the number of seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, and Amount, which is the transaction amount. This feature can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. The response variable, Class, takes on a value of one in cases of fraud and zero otherwise.
