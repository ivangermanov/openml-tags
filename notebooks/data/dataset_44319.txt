The Meta Album Sports Actions Dataset Extended is a comprehensive collection of sports images covering seventy-three different sports. The images are two hundred twenty-four by two hundred twenty-four by three in size and in jpeg format. They were gathered from internet searches and scanned with a duplicate image detector program to remove any duplicates.

For the Meta Album, the dataset was preprocessed and the images were resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using Open-CV.
