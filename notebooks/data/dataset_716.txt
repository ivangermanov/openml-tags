Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

The dataset appears to be a modified version of an existing dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target variable into a binary classification. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean value of the original target variable and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value fell below or above this mean threshold.

The binary classification is represented by 'P' for positive cases and 'N' for negative cases, providing a simplified two-class problem from what was originally a continuous or multi-class dataset. This type of data transformation is often used in machine learning and statistical analysis to convert regression problems into classification tasks or to simplify complex multi-class problems.

The original source and date of creation for this dataset are not specified, which may limit the ability to provide proper attribution or understand the full context of the data's origin and purpose.
