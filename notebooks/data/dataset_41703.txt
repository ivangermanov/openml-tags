PAR Ten performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of Mixed Integer Programming Library 2010. 

The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the table of evaluations. 

The features were generated using the Mixed Integer Programming feature computation code. 

To record runtimes of the feature computations, Run Solver was used. 

Part of Open Algorithm Challenge 2017, also known as Mira.
