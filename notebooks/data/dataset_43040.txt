The Post Operative Patient Data Set

The classification task of this database is to determine where patients in a post operative recovery area should be sent to next, which is a critical decision that healthcare professionals must make. Because hypothermia is a significant concern after surgery, the attributes correspond roughly to body temperature measurements.

### Attribute Information

The dataset includes various attributes that are relevant to determining the appropriate course of action for patients recovering from surgery. These include:

* Internal Temperature, which is categorized as high, mid, or low
* Surface Temperature, which is also categorized as high, mid, or low
* Oxygen Saturation, which is classified as excellent, good, fair, or poor
* Blood Pressure, which is categorized as high, mid, or low
* Stability of Surface Temperature, which is described as stable, moderately stable, or unstable
* Stability of Core Temperature, which is also described as stable, moderately stable, or unstable
* Stability of Blood Pressure, which is similarly described as stable, moderately stable, or unstable
* Perceived Comfort at Discharge, which is measured on a scale from zero to twenty
* Discharge Decision, which determines whether the patient will be sent to the Intensive Care Unit, prepared to go home, or sent to the general hospital floor

### Additional Information

This dataset has missing values, which may present challenges for analysis and modeling. The results of using the LERS algorithm on this dataset have achieved forty-eight percent accuracy.
