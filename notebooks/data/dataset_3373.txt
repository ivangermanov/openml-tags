QSAR-TID-100155 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100155. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The drug target TID: 100155 is a protein known as ADAM10, which is a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, cell adhesion, and signaling pathways. The protein is also known to play a role in the development of certain diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

The QSAR data in this dataset can be used to develop predictive models for the activity of compounds on the ADAM10 protein. These models can be used to identify potential drug candidates and to optimize their activity through iterative design and testing.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on the development of drugs targeting the ADAM10 protein. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data that can be used to develop predictive models and to identify potential drug candidates.
