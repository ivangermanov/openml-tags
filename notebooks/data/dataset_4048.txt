QSAR-TID-11727 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11727. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1174 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

Scraped Data:

Epoxide Hydratase is a single protein with the preferred name Epoxide Hydratase. It is also known as Bifunctional Epoxide Hydrolase 2, CEH, Cytosolic Epoxide Hydrolase 2, EPHX2, and Epoxide Hydratase. It is an enzyme that belongs to the serine protease SC clan and serine protease S33 family.

The protein target classification is 1. Enzyme/Protease/Serine protease/Serine protease SC clan/Serine protease S33 family.

The dataset is related to Homo sapiens species group and has no protein target classification.

The description of the protein target is Bifunctional Epoxide Hydrolase 2.

The dataset contains information about the protein target, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description.

The dataset also contains information about the compounds, including their ChEMBL ID, parent molecule name, parent molecule type, mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval.
