QSAR-TID-100854 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is capable of generating fingerprints without requiring missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction.

The dataset contains multiple features, including MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50, which are essential for QSAR modeling. The features are human-readable and provide valuable information about the compounds and their activity on the drug target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data that can be used to develop predictive models and identify potential drug candidates.
