Gas Turbine 2013 

Tags: Agriculture, Images test 

The dataset contains instances of eleven sensor measures aggregated over one hour from a gas turbine located in Turkey's northwest region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions, namely carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. The data comes from the same power plant as the dataset used for predicting hourly net energy yield. By contrast, this data is collected in another data range, includes gas turbine parameters such as turbine inlet temperature and compressor discharge pressure in addition to the ambient variables.

Note that the dates are not given in the instances but the data are sorted in chronological order. See the attribute information and relevant paper for details. Kindly follow the protocol mentioned in the paper for reproducibility and comparability of works. The dataset can be well used for predicting turbine energy yield using ambient variables as features.
