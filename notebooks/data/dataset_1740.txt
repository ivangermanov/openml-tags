This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: nineteen thousand nine hundred three, and it has forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains information about a specific drug target, namely the Neurokinin three receptor, also known as the Neurokinin B receptor, Neuromedin-K receptor, NK-three R, NK-three receptor, and NKR. It belongs to the species group Cavia porcellus.

The Neurokinin three receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and tachykinin receptor signaling pathway.

This receptor has been shown to have transmembrane signaling receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and tachykinin receptor activity. It is located in the plasma membrane and is involved in various cellular components, including the plasma membrane and membrane.
