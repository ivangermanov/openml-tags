Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: group, concentration, age, at risk, binary class

This dataset focuses on arsenic exposure and its effects on female lung health. It has been processed to create a binary classification, dividing cases into positive and negative categories based on a calculated mean value. The original numeric data was transformed to facilitate this classification approach. The dataset includes information on groupings, concentration levels, age of subjects, risk factors, and the resulting binary classification. This resource may be valuable for researchers studying environmental toxins, lung health, and gender-specific health impacts.
