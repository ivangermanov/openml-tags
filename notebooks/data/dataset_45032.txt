This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. It is one of forty-one drug design datasets formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The original studies include Carbolenes, MTP2, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat2, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama1, and Yokoyama2. These studies were published in various journals, including the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry and the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science.

The dataset is part of a larger collection of datasets used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on drug design and discovery projects.

Keywords: drug design, machine learning, benchmarking, Adriana.Code software, molecular descriptors, QSAR models.
