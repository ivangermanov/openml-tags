**Adult Dataset**

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset is part of the LIBSVM data repository. Please cite http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult for further information.

The original Adult dataset contains fourteen features, comprising six continuous and eight categorical attributes. To preprocess the data, continuous features were discretized into quantiles, with each quantile represented by a binary feature. Additionally, categorical features with multiple categories were converted into separate binary features. Detailed information on the conversion process for each feature can be accessed through the following link: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/adult.zip.

The dataset includes various attributes, including those related to demographics, employment, education, and income levels.
