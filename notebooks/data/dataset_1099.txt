Egyptian Skulls 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

This dataset is part of the Data and Story Library project, which illustrates the use of basic statistical methods and has been converted to ARFF format. The original source of this data is unknown, but it was obtained from TunedIT.

The data consists of four measurements of male Egyptian skulls from five different time periods. These measurements include the maximal breadth of skull, basibregmatic height of skull, basalveolar length of skull, and nasal height of skull. There are thirty skulls measured from each time period.

The dataset contains one hundred fifty cases. Each case represents a single skull measurement, and there are five variables associated with each case: maximal breadth, basibregmatic height, basalveolar length, nasal height, and year of skull formation. The year variable indicates the approximate year when the skull was formed, with negative values indicating years before Christ and positive values indicating years after Christ.

This dataset is based on research published in Ancient Races of the Thebaid by Oxford University Press. It has also been featured in other publications, including A Handbook of Small Data Sets and Multivariate Statistical Methods.
