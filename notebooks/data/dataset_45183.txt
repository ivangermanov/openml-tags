Hailfinder Bayesian Network. Sample 8.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, and the average degree is two point three six. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Hailfinder Bayesian system is designed for forecasting severe weather. It is a complex system that takes into account various factors, including cloud cover, wind patterns, and atmospheric conditions.

The system features a range of variables, including Cap in Scenario, Mid Level Lapse Rate, Wind Aloft, Low Level Lapse Rate, Scenario Relative to AMCIN, Combined Moisture, Mean Relative Humidity, Synoptic Forcing, AM Instability Mountain, Scenario Relative to AM Instability, Morning CIN, Subjective Vertical Motion, QG Vertical Motion, Outflow from Mountain, Combined Clouds, Satellite Contoured Moisture, Area of Moist Dry Air, AM Instability Wind Liability Scenario, IR Cloud Cover, Cloud Shade Convection, Lifted Index Fr Twelve ZDENSd, Scenario Relative to Place Forecast, Current Propagation Convection, N Zero Seven Mu Vertical Motion, Temperature Dissipation, Scenario, Movement Features, Instability Change, Low Level Wind, Boundaries, Low Level Moisture Advection, Area Meso ALS, Wind Hodograph, Latest CIN, Mountain Forecast, Date, RH Ratio, Visible Cloud Coverage, Scenario Relative Three Four, N Thirty-Four Star Forecast, Cap Change, Wind Field Mountain, Instability in Mountain, Instability Scale in Scenario, Composite Place Forecast, Cloud Shade Other, Rao Contoured Moisture, Morning Boundaries, R Five Forecast, Dewpoints, Combined Vertical Motion, AM Dewpoint Calculated Place, Surface Wind Shift Dissipation, AMCIN in Scenario, Wind Field Plane, Plains Forecast.
