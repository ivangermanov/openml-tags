QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Lysophosphatidic acid receptor, also known as GPR, GPR, G protein coupled receptor, G protein coupled receptor, and LPA. This receptor is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor category, specifically the small molecule receptor and lipid like ligand receptor subcategories within the EDG receptor group.

The Lysophosphatidic acid receptor is associated with several cellular components including the plasma membrane. Its molecular functions involve G protein coupled receptor activity. The receptor participates in various biological processes such as signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of CREB transcription factor activity, and behavioral response to pain.

This target is referenced in multiple databases including ExpressionAtlas, Gene Ontology, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. It is involved in G alpha (q) signaling events, G alpha (i) signaling events, and Lysosphingolipid and LPA receptors pathways according to Reactome.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship studies related to this important drug target, enabling researchers to explore compound activities and molecular properties in the context of drug discovery and development.
