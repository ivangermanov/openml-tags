Name: Phoneme Seed Four Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Phoneme with seed equal to four, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. The function selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum number of columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data accordingly and selects a subset of the data.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string for OpenML and returns a dataset with the subsampled data.
