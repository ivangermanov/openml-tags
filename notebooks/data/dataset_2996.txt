Credit Card Fraud Detection 

Tags: Education, Human Activities 

Context 
It is essential for credit card companies to identify fraudulent transactions accurately, ensuring that customers are not charged for unauthorized purchases. 

Content 
The dataset comprises transactions made by European credit card holders in September 2013. The dataset spans two days, containing 492 fraudulent transactions out of a total of 284,807 transactions. Notably, the positive class (frauds) accounts for a mere 0.172 percent of all transactions. The dataset consists solely of numerical input variables resulting from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformations. Due to confidentiality concerns, the original features and additional background information regarding the data remain undisclosed.

Features 
The dataset includes the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, denoted as Time, and the transaction amount, referred to as Amount. These features were not subject to PCA transformation. The remaining features, namely V1 through V28, represent the principal components obtained via PCA. The Class feature serves as the response variable, taking a value of one in instances of fraud and zero otherwise.

Inspiration 
The primary objective is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Considering the significant class imbalance, it is recommended to measure accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). The traditional confusion matrix accuracy is deemed less meaningful for unbalanced classification scenarios.
