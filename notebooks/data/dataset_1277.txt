QSAR-TID-226 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 226. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The data was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this source when using the dataset.

The dataset contains information about the Beta-3 Adrenergic Receptor, also known as ADRB3, ADRB3R, B3AR, and other synonyms. It is a single protein and a member of the family A G protein-coupled receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including diet-induced thermogenesis, norepinephrine-epinephrine-mediated vasodilation involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, desensitization of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway by arrestin, and others.

Some compounds have been identified as having an effect on the Beta-3 Adrenergic Receptor, including LY377604, Ritobegron, Vibegron, Rafabegron, and Mirabegron. These compounds act as agonists of the receptor, and some have been approved for therapeutic use.

The dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying the Beta-3 Adrenergic Receptor and its role in various biological processes. It can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies and to better understand the mechanisms of action of existing treatments.
