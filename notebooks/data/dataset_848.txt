Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: vote, tax rate, budget, budget change, tax rate change, binary class

This dataset, known as Schlvote, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified two-class classification problem. The process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean were labeled as positive, while those above were designated as negative. This transformation allows for easier analysis and application of binary classification algorithms.

The dataset encompasses various political and economic factors, including voting patterns, tax rates, budgetary information, and their respective changes over time. These features provide a comprehensive view of the interplay between fiscal policy and electoral behavior. Researchers and analysts can utilize this binarized version to investigate relationships between economic indicators and voting outcomes, potentially uncovering insights into voter preferences and policy impacts.

As with many datasets in the field of political science and economics, it is crucial to consider the context and limitations of the data when drawing conclusions. Users of this dataset are encouraged to refer to the original version for more nuanced analyses and to cite this binarized adaptation appropriately in their work.
