Name: KDD Cup Ninety-Nine Seed Three

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup Ninety-Nine with seed equals three arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset. It takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes using their value counts as probabilities. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the maximum number of columns. It then selects the corresponding columns from the dataset.

If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the dataset accordingly. It concatenates the dataset with its target variable, performs a train-test split with stratification, and selects the subset of the desired size.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string and returns the subsampled dataset.
