**Car Evaluation Database**

This database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX. The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure: Car Acceptability, which is comprised of Overall Price, Technical Characteristics, and Comfort. Overall Price is further divided into Buying Price and Price of Maintenance. Technical Characteristics include Comfort, which is comprised of Number of Doors, Capacity in Terms of Persons to Carry, Size of Luggage Boot, and Estimated Safety of the Car.

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, directly relating Car Acceptability to the six input attributes. Because of the known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.
