The Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX. The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure: Car Acceptability, which is further divided into Overall Price, Technical Characteristics, and Comfort.

Overall Price consists of Buying Price and Maintenance Price. Technical Characteristics comprise Comfort, which is further broken down into Number of Doors, Capacity in Terms of Persons to Carry, Size of Luggage Boot, and Estimated Safety of the Car.

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept, the model includes three intermediate concepts: Price, Tech, and Comfort. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower-level descendants by a set of examples.

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, directly relating Car Acceptability to the six input attributes: Buying Price, Maintenance Price, Number of Doors, Capacity in Terms of Persons to Carry, Size of Luggage Boot, and Estimated Safety of the Car. Because of the known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

This database does not have missing values.

Additional variable information includes:
Buying Price has values very high, high, medium, and low.
Maintenance Price has values very high, high, medium, and low.
Number of Doors has values two, three, four, and five or more.
Capacity in Terms of Persons to Carry has values two, four, and more.
Size of Luggage Boot has values small, medium, and big.
Estimated Safety of the Car has values low, medium, and high.

Class labels include unacceptable, acceptable, good, and very good.
