QSAR-TID-11361 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11361. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11361. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The target protein is Phosphorylase Kinase Gamma Subunit One, which is a single protein and a preferred name. It has several synonyms, including PHKG, PHKG One, PHK-gamma-M, Phosphorylase b Kinase Gamma Catalytic Chain, Skeletal Muscle/Heart Isoform, and Phosphorylase Kinase Subunit Gamma-One. The protein is from Homo sapiens and belongs to the species group. It is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CAMK protein kinase group, and CAMK protein kinase PHk family.

The protein has several functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, phosphorylase kinase activity, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, enzyme binding, and tau-protein kinase activity. It is involved in several biological processes, including carbohydrate metabolic process, glycogen metabolic process, glycogen biosynthetic process, protein phosphorylation, and phosphorylation.
