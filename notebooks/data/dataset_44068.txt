Particulate Matter UK Air 2017

This dataset is used in the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same way. It belongs to the "regression on categorical and numerical features" benchmark.

The dataset contains hourly particulate matter air pollution data of Great Britain for the year 2017, provided by Ricardo Energy and Environment on behalf of the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Devolved Administrations. The data was scraped from the UK AIR homepage via the R-package, and was published by DEFRA under the Open Government Licence.

The data was chosen for its comprehensive coverage of particulate matter air pollution, with a focus on the variable "Particulate Matter 10" as the target. Additionally, the dataset contains another measure of particulate matter, "Particulate Matter 2.5", which could be used as the target instead. The string variable "datetime" could be used to construct additional date and time features.

In this version of the dataset, the features "Longitude" and "Latitude" were removed to increase the importance of the categorical features "Zone" and "Site Name". The dataset includes features such as Hour, Month, Day of Week, Environment Type, Altitude, and Particulate Matter 2.5.
