The KDD98 dataset is a challenge that aims to estimate the return from a direct mailing in order to maximize donation profits. This dataset represents a problem of binary classification, specifically determining whether there was a response to the mailing. The features of this dataset include various demographic and behavioral characteristics of the individuals who received the mailing, such as their age, date of birth, and donation history. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the type of mailing campaign and the response to previous mailings.

The goal of this challenge is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether an individual will respond to a direct mailing, based on their characteristics and behavior. This is a complex problem, as it involves analyzing a large number of variables and identifying the most important factors that influence an individual's response to a mailing.

Some of the key features of this dataset include the individual's age, their history of donating to charitable causes, and their response to previous mailings. The dataset also includes information about the type of mailing campaign, such as whether it was a personalized or general mailing.
