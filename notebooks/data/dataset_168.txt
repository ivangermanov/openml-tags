BNG Lymph Dataset

Tags: Artificial Study

Features:

The dataset focuses on Lymphatics, specifically the Block of Afferent Lymphatic Channels, Block of Lymph Capillaries, and Block of Lymph Sinuses.

It also explores the concept of By-Pass, where fluids or substances bypass normal pathways, and Extravasation, where fluids or substances leak out of blood vessels.

Additionally, the dataset examines Regeneration of Lymph Nodes, Early Uptake in Lymph Nodes, and changes in Lymph Node dimensions, including Diminution and Enlargement.

Other key aspects include Defects in Lymph Nodes, Changes in Lymph Node Structure, Special Forms of Lymph Nodes, Dislocation of Lymph Nodes, Exclusion of Normal Lymph Nodes, and the Number of Nodes involved in various processes.

Lastly, the dataset delves into Changes in Lymphatic Structures and Classifications related to these changes.
