The QSAR-TID-11061 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11061. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for machine learning and predictive modeling applications.

The data was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and shows activity values in units of pseudo-pCI50. The dataset has multiple features, including molecular identifiers and class labels.

The Motilin receptor, also known as GPR thirty-eight, is a single protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor group. It is primarily involved in peptide receptor activities and is targeted by multiple small molecules and proteins.

Some of the compounds in this dataset have been shown to be Motilin receptor agonists, indicating their potential therapeutic application. These compounds include Mitemcinal, Camcinal, and Atilmotin, among others.

The Motilin receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. It is primarily located in the cytosol and plasma membrane and is involved in hormone binding activities.
