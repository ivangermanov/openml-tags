This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset contains information related to various chemical compounds and their properties. It includes data on carbolenes, melting points of solid drugs, molecular diversity descriptors, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity relationships, toxicity and biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro and bromoalkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, stability of purposely modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The studies cover a wide range of topics in medicinal chemistry, including quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), and quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships (QSBR). These analyses are crucial for understanding the relationships between molecular structures and their biological activities or physical properties.

The dataset incorporates various molecular descriptors and statistical methods to predict and interpret biological activity, toxicity, biodegradability, and other properties of chemical compounds. This information is valuable for drug design, environmental toxicology, and other fields of chemical research.
