GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be used to estimate various quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under ROC curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms. The repository was created to address the growing need in machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems. This allows for comparison of different classification and feature selection techniques across a consistent set of problems.

The gene expression samples in the GEMLeR repository originate from the publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The expO project aims to procure tissue samples under standard conditions and perform gene expression analyses on clinically annotated, deidentified tumor samples. The tumor data is updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without intellectual property restrictions, benefiting patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on several factors, including consistency in tissue sample processing procedures, use of the same microarray platform for all samples, availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and access to a large number of samples for various tumor types.

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, researchers are encouraged to acknowledge the assistance received from this repository. This helps others obtain the same datasets and replicate experiments. Proper citation information is provided for referencing the repository in publications. Additionally, researchers are welcome to acknowledge the contribution of the Expression Project for Oncology and the International Genomics Consortium for making their gene expression samples publicly available.

The dataset includes numerous features, primarily consisting of gene identifiers and expression values. These features are represented by alphanumeric codes that correspond to specific genes or genetic markers analyzed in the microarray experiments.
