Features: ID, molecule name, conformation name, and numerous feature columns labeled f through f with associated numbers. These features likely represent various chemical or structural properties of musk molecules and their conformations.

This dataset appears to be related to the study of musk molecules and their various conformations. Musk is a class of aromatic substances commonly used in perfumery. The multi instance nature of the dataset suggests that multiple conformations or instances of each musk molecule are included. The mythbusting and study tags indicate that this dataset may be used to challenge existing assumptions or conduct in-depth analyses of musk molecules and their properties.

The dataset is hosted in the MLRR (Machine Learning and Reasoning Repository) and is also available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Researchers and data scientists interested in chemical analysis, molecular structures, or perfume development may find this dataset particularly useful for their studies and experiments.
