Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

The CPU Small dataset focuses on various computer performance metrics and system calls. It includes features such as read and write operations, system calls, memory usage, and swap space availability. The dataset has been transformed to create a binary classification problem, making it suitable for machine learning tasks that require a categorical target variable.

This binarized version offers researchers and data scientists an opportunity to explore classification algorithms and compare their performance against the original regression problem. By converting the continuous target variable into two distinct classes, the dataset enables the application of a wide range of classification techniques and facilitates the study of decision boundaries in the feature space.

The CPU Small dataset serves as a valuable resource for those interested in computer performance analysis, system resource management, and the application of machine learning algorithms to real-world computing problems. It provides a practical example of how continuous data can be transformed into a binary classification task, opening up new avenues for analysis and model development.
