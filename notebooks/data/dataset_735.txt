Rabe Dataset 

Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This process enables the classification of instances into two distinct groups based on their target values.

Features include several columns of data, although the specific names of these columns are not descriptive.
