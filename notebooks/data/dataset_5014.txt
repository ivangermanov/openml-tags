**Diabetes Bayesian Network**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a discrete and very large network consisting of numerous nodes and arcs.

The network has a total number of nodes, which represent variables related to diabetes, and a substantial number of arcs, which symbolize the relationships between these variables. Moreover, the network comprises an extensive number of parameters, signifying the complexity of the model. The average Markov blanket size and average degree further highlight the intricate nature of this network.

This Diabetes Bayesian Network is based on a model-based approach to insulin adjustment. The network incorporates various factors influencing blood glucose levels, including meal intake, insulin absorption, and insulin sensitivity.

The network's features include meal and CHO (carbohydrate) intake, insulin absorption, blood glucose levels, renal clearance, insulin independent utility, glucose production, and many others related to diabetes management.
