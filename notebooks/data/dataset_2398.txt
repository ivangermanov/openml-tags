BNG Ionosphere Dataset

Tags: Agriculture, Artificial, Chemistry, Study

This dataset focuses on the ionosphere, a region of the Earth's atmosphere that extends from about eighty to six hundred kilometers altitude, containing a high concentration of ions and free electrons. The study of this phenomenon is crucial for understanding various aspects of agriculture, including the impact of atmospheric conditions on crop growth and yield.

The dataset features multiple variables related to the ionosphere, including but not limited to its composition, temperature, and density. These variables are essential in comprehending the complex chemistry involved in the ionosphere and its effects on the environment.
