The QSAR-TID-12506 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12506. This dataset has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI50.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The target protein in this dataset is mitogen-activated protein kinase eleven, also known as map kinase p38 beta. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/cmgc protein kinase group/cmgc protein kinase mapk family/cmgc protein kinase p38 subfamily classification.

The preferred name for this target is map kinase p38 beta, and it has several synonyms, including mapk eleven, map kinase eleven, and mitogen-activated protein kinase eleven.

The organism associated with this target is mus musculus, and it is classified under the single protein type.

The target has several functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, map kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

It is involved in various biological processes, such as mapk cascade, osteoblast differentiation, protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of gene expression, phosphorylation, stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, positive regulation of interleukin-twelve production, intracellular signal transduction, stress-activated mapk cascade, cardiac muscle cell proliferation, regulation of cardiac muscle cell proliferation, negative regulation of cardiac muscle cell proliferation, bone development, cellular response to interleukin-one, cellular response to uv-b, and cellular response to virus.
