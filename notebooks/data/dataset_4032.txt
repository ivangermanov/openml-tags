The QSAR-TID-101504 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101504. This dataset has ninety-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The compound activity values are represented as pseudo-pCI fifty units. The molecular fingerprints were generated without requiring missing value imputation, as all bits are generated during the fingerprinting process.

The features include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, and nine hundred twenty-six more features representing FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is related to health and medicine, specifically focusing on QSAR modeling and molecular fingerprints. It can be used for building predictive models for compound activity on the specified drug target.

Keywords: QSAR modeling, molecular fingerprints, drug target, compound activity, health, medicine.
