This dataset, known as CMC, focuses on contraceptive method choice and includes various demographic and socioeconomic factors. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem, where the majority class is labeled as positive and all other classes are labeled as negative. The features encompass information about both spouses, including their ages, education levels, and occupations, as well as family size, religious affiliation, employment status, living standards, and media exposure. This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for mythbusting and study purposes in the field of contraceptive use and family planning.
