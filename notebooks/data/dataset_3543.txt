Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred eighty-six eight, and it has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprints of One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
