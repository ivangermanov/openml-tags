QSAR-TID-100868 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100868. The dataset has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100868. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Serotonin seven receptor, also known as the five-HT seven receptor, which is a type of G protein-coupled receptor.

The Serotonin seven receptor is a membrane receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and chemical synaptic transmission. It is also involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm and vasoconstriction.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Serotonin seven receptor. It can be used to build predictive models of compound activity and to identify potential lead compounds for further optimization.
