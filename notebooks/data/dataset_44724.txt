Name: Adult Dataset Subsample with One Seed and Two Thousand Rows

Tags: Subsampling of the Adult Dataset with Seed Equal to One, Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, Ten Classes, and Stratification Enabled

Generated with the following source code:

The Adult dataset was subsampled using a custom function that takes in several parameters, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean flag for stratification. The function uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility.

First, the function uniformly samples classes from the dataset, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, selecting a specified number of columns at random. If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
