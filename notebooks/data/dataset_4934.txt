**Insurance Bayesian Network. Sample Four**

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which provides a comprehensive collection of Bayesian networks for research purposes.

The Insurance Bayesian Network consists of twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with a total of one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point nineteen, while the average degree is around three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree of this network is three.

This Bayesian network represents relationships between various factors influencing car insurance premiums, including driver characteristics, vehicle attributes, and socio-economic factors.

The network features include driving history, driving skill, age, ruggedness of automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft devices, driver quality, risk aversion, good student discounts, other cars owned, make and model, accident history, socio-economic status, home base, property cost, car value, anti-lock brakes, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft rates, airbags, medical costs, senior training, and cushioning systems.
