QSAR-TID-10880 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10880. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it provides valuable information for researchers and scientists in the field of economics, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. 

The drug target, Protein Kinase C Gamma, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell signaling, metabolism, and gene expression. It is involved in different cellular activities, such as protein phosphorylation, neurotransmitter release, and cell proliferation.

The dataset includes information about the expression atlas, component ontology, function ontology, process ontology, and other relevant details. The expression atlas provides information about the gene expression profiles across different tissues and cells. The component ontology describes the cellular components where the protein is located, while the function ontology outlines the molecular functions of the protein. The process ontology explains the biological processes in which the protein is involved.

Furthermore, the dataset includes links to other databases, such as UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam, which provide additional information about the protein sequence, structure, and function. These resources enable researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the protein's biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.
