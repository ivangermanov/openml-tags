I have created this dataset, named Predict Amazon Stock Price Tomorrow, to showcase the use of predictive modeling using the stock market as a case study. This dataset is designed to help and predict tomorrow's Amazon stock price. If you want to get the most updated dataset, you will need to pull them in real-time.

The uploaded dataset is a snapshot of the data available on a specific date. I have shared my code to pull data using the Yahoo Finance API and preprocess it in the Data Analytics for Fun GitHub repository.

The dataset consists of several columns, including yesterday's Amazon stock price change, last week's Amazon stock price change, yesterday's Dow Jones change, last week's Dow Jones change, yesterday's NASDAQ 100 change, last week's NASDAQ 100 change, and today's Amazon stock price change.

To learn more about the dataset and see a simple prediction model applied to the dataset, you can watch a YouTube video where the dataset and prediction are explained in detail: A Taste for Prediction - Predict Tomorrow's Amazon Stock Price.
