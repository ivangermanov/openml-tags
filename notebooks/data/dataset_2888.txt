Federal Election Dataset: Social Media, Statistics

General Description:

The Federal Election Commission categorizes contributions from individuals based on the calendar year-to-date amount for Political Action Committee and Party Committee receipts, and the election-cycle-to-date amount for Candidate receipts, to determine whether the contribution meets the categorization threshold.

Currently, since 2015, contributions exceeding Two Hundred Dollars are considered significant. Prior to this, from 1989 to 2014, the threshold was also Two Hundred Dollars, determined by the reporting period amount. Earlier still, from 1975 to 1988, the threshold was Five Hundred Dollars, also determined by the reporting period amount.
