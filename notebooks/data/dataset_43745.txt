Delinquency Telecom Dataset

Tags: Context Delinquency

Delinquency is a condition that arises when an activity or situation does not occur at its scheduled or expected date, that is, it occurs later than expected.

Many donors, experts, and microfinance institutions have become convinced that using mobile financial services is more convenient and efficient, and less costly, than the traditional high-touch model for delivering microfinance services. Mobile financial services become especially useful when targeting the unbanked poor living in remote areas. The implementation of mobile financial services, though, has been uneven with both significant challenges and successes. Today, microfinance is widely accepted as a poverty-reduction tool, representing a global outreach of millions of clients.
