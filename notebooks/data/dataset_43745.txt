Many experts and microfinance institutions have come to believe that utilizing mobile financial services is more convenient, efficient, and cost-effective compared to the traditional high-touch model for providing microfinance services. This approach becomes particularly valuable when targeting impoverished individuals residing in remote areas. Although the implementation of mobile financial services has faced significant challenges and achieved notable successes, microfinance has emerged as a widely accepted tool for reducing poverty, boasting seventy billion dollars in outstanding loans and a global outreach of two hundred million clients.
