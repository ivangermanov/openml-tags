QSAR-TID-30046 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30046. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30046. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Ephrin type-A receptor six, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as EHK two, EHK-two, EK twelve, EPHA six, and EPH homology kinase two. It belongs to the protein kinase group and is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and axon guidance.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the Ephrin type-A receptor six in different tissues and cells, including the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, membrane, and dendrite. It also provides information on the molecular function of the receptor, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity.
