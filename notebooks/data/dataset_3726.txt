This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Ephrin type-A receptor six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The MetaQSAR project dataset provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data, featuring multiple compounds and their corresponding activity values on the Ephrin type-A receptor six target. This dataset is particularly useful for machine learning and statistical analysis, allowing researchers to develop predictive models and identify patterns in the data.

The Ephrin type-A receptor six is a single protein target, also known as EHK two or EPH homology kinase two, belonging to the enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and TK protein kinase group. It is primarily involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, axon guidance, and ephrin receptor signaling pathway.
