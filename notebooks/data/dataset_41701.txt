The CPMP Classification Dataset is a benchmark for the Container Pre-Marshalling Problem, which is categorized under Algorithm Selection, Computer Systems, and Economics. 

This dataset is an extension of the Premarshalling dataset released in 2013, featuring additional attributes and a new set of test instances. It comprises three distinct sets of attributes: 

Firstly, the feature values file contains the comprehensive set of attributes derived from the second iteration of the Latent Feature Analysis process. Secondly, the feature values iteration one file encompasses only the attributes resulting from the first iteration of this process. Lastly, the feature values original file retains the attributes utilized in the Premarshalling Astar 2013 dataset.

Similarly, the test data is structured identically, with analogous filenames. Since the attributes related to the pre-marshalling problem are effortlessly computable and swift, the feature costs file has been omitted, as its contents would uniformly indicate zero time for each attribute, regardless of whether the original, iteration one, or iteration two attributes are employed.

The feature computation code is accessible online, providing further insight into this aspect. Notably, the Premarshalling Astar 2015 scenario has undergone a rename to conserve storage space.

The key attributes incorporated within this dataset include instance identification, repetition count, number of stacks, tiers per stack, stack-to-tier ratio, container density, percentage of empty stacks, and the proportion of stacks experiencing over-stowing, among others.
