CPMP Classification

This dataset is an extension of the Premarshalling Dataset from 2013, featuring additional features and a set of test instances. The dataset includes three sets of features: the full set of features from the second iteration of the Latent Feature Analysis process, a reduced set of features from the first iteration, and the original features used in the Premarshalling A-Star 2013 dataset.

The features for the Container Premarshalling Problem are all extremely easy and fast to compute, making the feature computation code readily available. The dataset provides test data with an identical naming scheme.

The features include instance identification, repetition, stack and tier information, container density, empty stack percentage, overstowing stack percentage, group similarity metrics, top good container metrics, overstowage percentage, and bottom floor left behind metrics.

The dataset also includes algorithm and runtime information, as well as run status.
