This dataset contains one thousand eighty documents of free text business descriptions of Brazilian companies categorized into a subset of nine categories. These categories are cataloged in a table called National Classification of Economic Activities.

The original texts were preprocessed to obtain the current dataset. Initially, only letters were kept, and then prepositions were removed from the texts. Next, the words were transformed to their canonical form. Finally, each document was represented as a vector, where the weight of each word is its frequency in the document.

This dataset is highly sparse, with ninety-nine point twenty-two percent of the matrix filled with zeros.
