Description:
This dataset contains documents of free text business descriptions of Brazilian companies categorized into a subset of categories. The documents are sourced from the National Classification of Economic Activities (Classificação Nacional de Atividade Econômicas - CNAE) table. The original texts underwent preprocessing to create the current dataset. This process involved retaining only letters, removing prepositions, transforming words to their canonical form, and representing each document as a vector where the weight of each word is its frequency in the document. The resulting dataset is highly sparse, with a significant portion of the matrix filled with zeros.

Data Set Information:
The dataset comprises documents of free text business descriptions from Brazilian companies, categorized into a subset of categories from the CNAE table. The preprocessing steps applied to the original texts included keeping only letters, removing prepositions, transforming words to their canonical form, and representing each document as a frequency-based vector. This preprocessing resulted in a highly sparse dataset.

Attribute Information:
The dataset contains numerous attributes, including one attribute for the class of instance and many attributes representing word frequencies. The class attribute ranges from one to nine as an integer. The word frequency attributes are also represented as integers.

Relevant Papers:
Several papers have been published utilizing this dataset, focusing on topics such as agglomeration and elimination of terms for dimensionality reduction, and evolving systems based on probabilistic neural networks. These studies were presented at international conferences and symposiums on intelligent systems design and artificial neural networks.

Features:
The dataset includes a large number of features, primarily representing word frequencies in the business descriptions. Due to the preprocessing steps, these features are highly sparse and represent the occurrence of specific words across the document corpus.
