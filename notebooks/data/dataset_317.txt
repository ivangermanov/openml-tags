Datasets for Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks

Cushing's Syndrome 
------------------

Data from study relate to patients diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome. The data file contains four columns: a label identifying the patient, tetrahydrocortisone levels measured in milligrams per twenty-four hours, pregnanetriol levels measured in milligrams per twenty-four hours, and the type of syndrome diagnosed. The type of the last six patients should be regarded as unknown.

Synthetic Two-Class Problem 
-----------------------------

This dataset represents a synthetic two-class problem. The data consists of two real-valued coordinates and a class label that is either zero or one. The training set contains two hundred fifty instances, while the test set contains one thousand instances.

Viruses 
--------

This dataset describes sixty-one viruses that affect various crops, including tobacco, tomato, and cucumber. Each virus is characterized by eighteen measurements of amino acid residues per molecule of coat protein. The entire dataset is organized by virus type, including hordeiviruses, tobraviruses, tobamoviruses, and furoviruses. 

Leptograpsus Crabs 
-------------------

This dataset contains morphological measurements of rock crabs of the genus Leptograpsus. There are fifty specimens of each sex and color form, resulting in a total of two hundred instances. The measurements include the frontal lip of the carapace, rear width of the carapace, length along the midline of the carapace, maximum width of the carapace, and body depth.

Forensic Glass 
--------------

This dataset originates from forensic testing of glass fragments. The data describes two hundred fourteen glass fragments, each characterized by its refractive index, weight percentages of various oxides, and a type label indicating the source of the glass, such as window glass, vehicle glass, or container glass.

Diabetes in Pima Indians 
-------------------------

This dataset relates to a population of Pima Indian women living near Phoenix, Arizona, who underwent testing for diabetes according to World Health Organization criteria. The data includes measurements of plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, serum insulin levels, body mass index, and diabetes pedigree function, as well as the presence or absence of diabetes.
