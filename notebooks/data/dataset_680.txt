Sleuth Case Dataset: A Collection of Chemical and Biological Data for Analysis and Myth-Busting

This dataset is a binarized version of the original collection, converting the numerical target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset encompasses various chemical and biological aspects, including brain and liver functions, treatment effects, and physiological parameters.

Features included in this dataset are brain function, liver function, time, treatment, days, sex, weight, and loss.
