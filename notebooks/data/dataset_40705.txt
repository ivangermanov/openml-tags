This dataset is comprised of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) data for the Tokyo server at Silicon Graphics International (SGI). It characterizes the server performance as either good or bad. The instances are measurements generated by the PCP software every five seconds. For further details, please refer to the PCP manual.

### Attribute Information

The attributes are interpreted as follows:

* Run Queue: The average number of runnable processes in main memory and in swap memory during the interval.
* Memory: The free column indicates the average free memory during the interval, in Kilobytes. The page column is the average number of page out operations per second during the interval. I/O operations caused by these page-out operations are included in the write I/O rate.
* System: The system call rate, context switch rate, and interrupt rate. Rates are expressed as average operations per second during the interval.
* Disks: The aggregated physical read and write rates over all disks, expressed as physical I/O operations issued per second during the interval. These rates are independent of the I/O block size.
* CPU: The percentage of CPU time spent executing user code, system and interrupt code, idle loop, and idle waiting for resources, typically disk I/O.
