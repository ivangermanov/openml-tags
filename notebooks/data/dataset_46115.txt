Diabetes Dataset
Tags: Description

The Diabetes dataset is a medical dataset constructed for the evaluation of machine learning models in predicting diabetes occurrences based on various diagnostic measurements. This dataset encapsulates the clinical parameters of several patients, providing a foundational basis for diabetes prediction research and healthcare analytics.

Attribute Description:

Pregnancy Count: The number of times a patient has been pregnant.

Glucose Level: The plasma glucose concentration at two hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

Blood Pressure: The diastolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury.

Skin Thickness: The triceps skin fold thickness in millimeters.

Insulin Level: The two-hour serum insulin level in micro units per milliliter.

Body Mass Index: The body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that provides a measure of the likelihood of diabetes based on family history and other factors.

Age: The patient's age in years.

Outcome: A class variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes, with one representing the presence of diabetes and zero representing the absence of diabetes.

Use Case:

This dataset is immensely useful for researchers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals aiming to develop and validate predictive models for diabetes. It can facilitate a variety of analyses, from basic correlations between variables to advanced machine learning models that predict diabetes occurrence based on patient data. Additionally, the dataset supports educational purposes for students and academicians in medical data analysis and machine learning application fields.
