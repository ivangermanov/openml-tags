This dataset was created for a university project in Milan, with the primary objective of developing a robust model capable of predicting the All-Star Game score for each player. The score calculation involves dividing players by conference and position held in the field, either external or internal, ranking them in descending order based on the number of votes received for each category voter. This process yields three distinct rankings, which are then used to calculate the overall rank for each player.

To achieve this, we combined datasets from Kaggle, Basketball-Reference.com, and Hoopshype.com, carefully selecting the most relevant variables while omitting others due to issues with independent observations. As a result, we only considered the last season's observation for each player.

The dataset includes various performance metrics, including games played, minutes played, field goals per game, three-point field goals per game, free throws per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, turnovers per game, personal fouls per game, and points per game. Additionally, we incorporated data on daily Wikipedia views, indicating a player's social media presence.

Features include:

* Player information: name, ID, primary position, secondary position, age, team 
* Performance metrics: games played, minutes played, field goals, free throws, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, personal fouls, points 
* Social media presence: daily Wikipedia views 
* All-Star Game performance: score, play status
