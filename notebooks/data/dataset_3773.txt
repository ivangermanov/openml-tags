QSAR-TID-10613 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10613. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10613. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the Prostanoid EP1 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as the PGE2 receptor EP1 subtype, PGE receptor EP1 subtype, Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP1 subtype, and Prostanoid EP1 receptor Ptger1. The receptor is found in the Mus musculus species and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in the response to lipopolysaccharide and response to lipid.
