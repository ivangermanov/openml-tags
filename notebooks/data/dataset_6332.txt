Description
The Cylinder Bands dataset is a collection of data related to process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing. This dataset was used to discover control rules that substantially mitigated these process delays using decision tree induction.

Attribute Information
The dataset consists of forty attributes for five hundred forty observations, including the class. Twenty of these attributes are numeric, and twenty are nominal. There are missing values in three hundred two of the instances.

The attributes include timestamp, cylinder number, customer, job number, grain screened, ink color, proof on ctd ink, blade manufacturer, cylinder division, paper type, ink type, direct steam, solvent type, type on cylinder, press type, press, unit number, cylinder size, paper mill location, plating tank, proof cut, viscosity, caliper, ink temperature, humidity, roughness, blade pressure, varnish percentage, press speed, ink percentage, solvent percentage, ESA Voltage, ESA Amperage, wax, hardener, roller durometer, current density, anode space ratio, chrome content, and band type.

Notes
The cylinder number is an identifier and should be ignored when modeling the data. The dataset consists of five hundred forty observations, not five hundred forty-one as stated in the UCI explanation.
