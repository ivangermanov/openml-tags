The Friedman dataset is an artificially generated collection of eighty datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting research. The dataset names are coded to convey information about their characteristics, specifically the degree of colinearity and the number of samples and features they contain.

The Friedman function is a complex mathematical formula that generates outputs based on inputs, incorporating both linear and nonlinear relationships, as well as normalized noise. This function includes five core features that influence the output, with additional features added to test the effects of unrelated variables.

To assess the impact of colinearity on algorithms, the datasets were generated with varying degrees of colinearity, ranging from zero to four, where a higher degree indicates more features dependent on others. The datasets also vary in terms of the number of samples, ranging from a small set to larger collections.

The generated Friedman datasets have diverse parameters, including different numbers of features, sample sizes, and colinearity degrees. While only the first five features are relevant to the output, the remaining features are randomly generated to simulate real-world scenarios where not all variables are meaningful.

As a result, eighty unique artificial datasets were created by combining different feature numbers, sample sizes, and colinearity degrees. Each dataset has a distinct set of characteristics, providing a rich foundation for testing and evaluating various algorithms.
