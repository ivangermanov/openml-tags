QSAR-TID-100413 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100413. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 998 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2 is a single protein preferred name, also known as BDNF/NT-3 growth factors receptor, GP145-TrkB, and Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Trk family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.
