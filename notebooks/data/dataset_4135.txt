The dataset consists of real historical data collected from 2010 and 2011. Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources over time. The data is used to create an algorithm capable of learning from this historical data to predict approval or denial for an unseen set of employees.

The dataset information provides insight into the process of employee access to resources. When an employee at any company starts work, they first need to obtain the computer access necessary to fulfill their role. This access may allow an employee to read or manipulate resources through various applications or web portals. It is assumed that employees fulfilling the functions of a given role will access the same or similar resources. It is often the case that employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work, such as not being able to log into a reporting portal. A knowledgeable supervisor then takes time to manually grant the needed access in order to overcome access obstacles.

As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery and recovery cycle wastes a non-trivial amount of time and money. There is a considerable amount of data regarding an employee's role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize the human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.

The dataset contains the following attributes:

* Action: Action is one if the resource was approved, zero if the resource was not
* Resource: An ID for each resource
* Manager ID: The employee ID of the manager of the current employee ID record; an employee may have only one manager at a time
* Role Rollup One: Company role grouping category ID one, such as US Engineering
* Role Rollup Two: Company role grouping category ID two, such as US Retail
* Role Department Name: Company role department description, such as Retail
* Role Title: Company role business title description, such as Senior Engineering Retail Manager
* Role Family Description: Company role family extended description, such as Retail Manager, Software Engineering
* Role Family: Company role family description, such as Retail Manager
* Role Code: Company role code; this code is unique to each role, such as Manager
