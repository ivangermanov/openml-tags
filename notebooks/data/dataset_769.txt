Rabe Dataset 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The resulting dataset contains several features, including column one, column two, column three, and column four, which are used to predict the binary class.
