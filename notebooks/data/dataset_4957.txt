**Water Bayesian Network**

This Bayesian network repository reference is available at [URL]. The Water Bayesian Network consists of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

The Water Bayesian Network was created as part of an expert system for control of waste water treatment. It represents a pilot project aimed at developing a system for managing waste water treatment plants.

The network includes various factors related to waste water treatment, including chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen levels, and biological oxygen demand. These factors are interconnected to represent the complex relationships between them.
