Pollen Luxembourg Dataset 

This dataset provides daily pollen concentration data for thirty-three different pollen types in Luxembourg, starting from January first, nineteen ninety-two. Each type of pollen is measured in terms of its concentration per cubic meter of air. In addition to pollen concentrations, the dataset also includes daily meteorological data, including minimum and maximum temperatures in Celsius and precipitation in millimeters.

The dataset combines data from two sources: the Luxembourg open data portal and the website pollen.lu. The latter website also provides guidelines on critical thresholds for various pollen types. For example, for Betula, Alnus, Corylus, and Quercus, low concentrations range from zero to ten, medium concentrations range from eleven to fifty, and high concentrations exceed fifty. For Gramineae, low concentrations range from zero to five, medium concentrations range from six to thirty, and high concentrations exceed thirty.

The dataset contains the following features: date, ambrosia pollen concentration, artemisia pollen concentration, asteraceae pollen concentration, alnus pollen concentration, betula pollen concentration, ericaceae pollen concentration, carpinus pollen concentration, castanea pollen concentration, quercus pollen concentration, chenopodium pollen concentration, cupressaceae pollen concentration, acer pollen concentration, fraxinus pollen concentration, gramineae pollen concentration, fagus pollen concentration, juncaceae pollen concentration, aesculus pollen concentration, larix pollen concentration, corylus pollen concentration, juglans pollen concentration, umbellifereae pollen concentration, ulmus pollen concentration, urtica pollen concentration, rumex pollen concentration, populus pollen concentration, pinaceae pollen concentration, plantago pollen concentration, platanus pollen concentration, salix pollen concentration, cyperaceae pollen concentration, filipendula pollen concentration, sambucus pollen concentration, tilia pollen concentration, maximum air temperature in Celsius, minimum air temperature in Celsius, and precipitation in Celsius.
