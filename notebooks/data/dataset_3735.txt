QSAR-TID-11680 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11680. The dataset has 395 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11680. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has 395 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and other machine learning applications.

The dataset contains information about the Vasopressin V1a receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as Antidiuretic hormone receptor 1a, Avpr1a, AVPR V1a, V1aR, and Vascular/hepatic-type arginine vasopressin receptor. The receptor is a membrane receptor and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor.

The dataset provides information about the expression of the Vasopressin V1a receptor in different tissues and cells. The receptor is expressed in the endosome, plasma membrane, membrane, endocytic vesicle, cytoplasmic vesicle membrane, and cytoplasmic vesicle. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by vasopressin, maternal aggressive behavior, positive regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
