This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11680, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically designed for government and social media studies. It contains information about various molecules, their chemical properties, and their interactions.

The molecules in this dataset have been tested for their activity on the Vasopressin V1a receptor, which is a single protein found in the Rattus norvegicus species group. This receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The Vasopressin V1a receptor is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, maternal aggressive behavior, and signal transduction. It also plays a role in the positive regulation of cell population proliferation, response to organic substances, and calcium-mediated signaling.

The molecules in this dataset have been described using various annotations, including Gene Ontology terms, UniProt identifiers, and Pfam domains. These annotations provide insight into the molecular function, biological process, and cellular component of each molecule.

Keywords: QSAR, Vasopressin V1a receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, calcium-mediated signaling, membrane receptor, peptide receptor.
