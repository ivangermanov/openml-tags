This dataset, known as version 2, has undergone modifications where certain features were removed for reasons that remain unclear. The original dataset was compiled at the University of Guelph and donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset contains various medical and physiological features related to horses suffering from colic. These features include surgical interventions, vital signs such as rectal temperature and pulse rate, physical examinations of extremities and mucous membranes, assessments of pain and abdominal distension, and laboratory test results.

Some of the specific features recorded in this dataset are:
Surgery, Age, Rectal Temperature, Pulse, Respiratory Rate, Temperature of Extremities, Peripheral Pulse, Mucous Membranes, Capillary Refill Time, Pain, Peristalsis, Abdominal Distension, Nasogastric Tube, Nasogastric Reflux, Nasogastric Reflux pH, Rectal Examination, Abdomen, Packed Cell Volume, Total Protein, Abdominocentesis Appearance, Abdominocentesis Total Protein, Outcome, and Surgical Lesion.

This comprehensive collection of features allows for in-depth analysis of equine colic cases, potentially aiding in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this serious condition in horses.
