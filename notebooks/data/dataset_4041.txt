This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BTK, and it has numerous rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive platform for QSAR modeling and analysis. The project focuses on generating high-quality QSAR models using machine learning algorithms and statistical methods. The dataset is particularly useful for researchers working on developing new inhibitors for Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BTK, a key enzyme involved in various cellular processes.

The features in this dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are numerical representations of molecules based on their structural properties. These fingerprints can be used as inputs for machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds against specific targets. The dataset also includes class labels indicating the activity of each compound, which can be used to train and evaluate QSAR models.

The dataset is part of a larger collection of QSAR datasets, which can be used for various applications such as virtual screening, lead optimization, and toxicity prediction. The dataset is particularly useful for researchers working on developing new inhibitors for Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BTK, which is involved in various diseases including cancer and autoimmune disorders.
