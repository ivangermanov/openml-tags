QSAR-TID-100097 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BTK, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BTK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BTK is a single protein, also known as Agammaglobulinemia Tyrosine Kinase, ATK, B-cell Progenitor Kinase, BPK, and other synonyms. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase, Tec family. The description of this protein target is a tyrosine-protein kinase BTK.

The dataset is related to other proteins, such as Tec family kinase, Protein Cereblon, and Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BTK, which are protein-protein interactions. There are also other molecules, such as SPEBRUTINIB, IBRUTINIB, RILZABRUTINIB, EDRALBRUTINIB, and MSC-2364447, which are small molecules and tyrosine-protein kinase BTK inhibitors.

The protein target is involved in various biological processes, such as neutrophil homeostasis, positive regulation of type III hypersensitivity, positive regulation of type I hypersensitivity, negative regulation of cytokine production, adaptive immune response, and many others. It is also involved in various cellular components, such as nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and others.
