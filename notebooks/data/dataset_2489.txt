This dataset, Jungle Chess Two Pieces Endgame Elephant Elephant, is part of a collection of datasets based on the game Jungle Chess, also known as Dou Shou Qi. For a description of the rules, please refer to the paper. The paper also contains a description of various constructed features.

As the tablebases are a disjoint set of several tablebases based on which two pieces are on the board, we have uploaded all tablebases that have explicit different content, including Rat versus Rat, Rat versus Panther, Rat versus Lion, Rat versus Elephant, Panther versus Lion, Panther versus Elephant, Tiger versus Lion, Lion versus Lion, Lion versus Elephant, Elephant versus Elephant, Complete, and Raw Complete. 

This dataset contains a similar classification problem as, for example, the King and Rook versus King problem and is suitable for classification tasks. Note that this dataset is one of the above-mentioned datasets. Additionally, note that several subproblems are very similar. Having seen a given position from one of the tablebases arguably gives a lot of information about the outcome of the same position in the other tablebases.

Please cite the paper published in the ICGA Journal, titled Endgame Analysis of Dou Shou Qi. An ArXiv link is also available.

The dataset includes features describing the game state, such as piece strengths, files, ranks, distances to dens, movements, and more. These features are used to classify the outcome of the game.
