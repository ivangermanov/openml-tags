Andes Bayesian Network. Sample Six.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a total of two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, resulting in one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, while the average degree is roughly three point zero three. The maximum in-degree is six.

On-line Student Modeling for Coached Problem Solving Using Bayesian Networks was published in Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on User Modeling.
