Cover Type 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset originates from the LibSVM repository, where it was retrieved. To use this dataset, please provide proper citation.

The Cover Type dataset in its binary version has undergone significant transformations. Initially, the dataset was loaded without scaling. Then, each file column was normalized according to specific rules. Columns containing only one value were set to zero and subsequently removed due to sparsity. Columns with two values had the most frequently occurring value set to zero, while the other value was set to one. Columns with multiple values were divided by their standard deviation. Finally, duplicate lines were removed.

Preprocessing involved transforming the multiclass dataset into a binary class.

Features include variables relevant to the Cover Type dataset.
