Andes Bayesian Network. Sample.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this network, which is characterized by its large number of nodes and arcs. This complex network has a total of two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, resulting in one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, and the average degree is around three point zero three. Furthermore, the maximum in-degree is six.

This network was designed to model student problem-solving behavior in an intelligent tutoring system. It represents the student's knowledge and problem-solving strategies, allowing for accurate modeling and prediction of their performance.

Features of this network include goal-oriented nodes, resolution nodes, and identification nodes, among others. These nodes work together to create a comprehensive representation of the student's thought process.
