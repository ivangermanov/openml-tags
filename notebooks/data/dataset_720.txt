Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset contains information about abalones, a type of marine mollusk. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, where the original numeric target feature has been transformed into two categories. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then classifying instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N').

The dataset includes various physical measurements of abalones, such as their length, diameter, height, and different weight measurements including whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, and shell weight. Additionally, the sex of each abalone is recorded. The final feature, binaryClass, represents the transformed target variable for classification purposes.

This binarized version of the abalone dataset can be particularly useful for machine learning tasks focused on binary classification problems, allowing researchers and data scientists to develop and test algorithms for predicting abalone characteristics based on the provided features.
