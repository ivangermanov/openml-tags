The Superconduct Dataset 

This dataset contains information about twenty-one thousand two hundred sixty-three superconductors. The first eighty-one columns consist of extracted features, while the eighty-second column represents the critical temperature, which serves as the target variable. 

The original data from which these features were derived originates from the public database found at http://supercon.nims.go.jp/index_en.html.
