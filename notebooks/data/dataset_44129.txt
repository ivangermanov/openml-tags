This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. 

The Higgs dataset is a smaller version of the original dataset, containing approximately one million rows. 

This dataset originated from the University of California Irvine and was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

The dataset is related to Higgs Boson detection data, which was produced using Monte Carlo simulations. 

The twenty-one features, including kinematic properties measured by particle detectors in the accelerator, are comprised of lepton PT, lepton eta, lepton phi, missing energy magnitude, missing energy phi, jet one PT, jet one eta, jet one phi, jet one b-tag, jet two PT, jet two eta, jet two phi, jet two b-tag, jet three PT, jet three eta, jet three phi, jet three b-tag, jet four PT, jet four eta, and jet four b-tag. 

Additionally, there are seven high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes, including m jj, m jjj, m lv, m jlv, m bb, m wbb, and m wwbb. 

There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. 

The last portion of the dataset, approximately half a million examples, is used as a test set.
