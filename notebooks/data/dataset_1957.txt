QSAR-TID-119 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 119. It has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The Calcitonin Receptor is a single protein, also known as Calcitonin-Like Receptor, CT-R, or Amylin Receptor. It is a member of the Family B G Protein-Coupled Receptor family and is involved in various biological processes, including ossification, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathways.

The dataset was scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, Expression Atlas, Go Component, Go Function, Go Process, Guide to Pharmacology, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
