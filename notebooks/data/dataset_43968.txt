Pol Dataset is a machine learning dataset specifically designed for classification tasks involving numerical features. It belongs to the "Classification on Numerical Features" benchmark, which is part of a larger tabular data benchmark.

This dataset has undergone transformation, where the numeric target feature was converted into a two-class nominal target feature. The conversion process involved computing the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset consists of various features, including those related to medical information. Unfortunately, the exact meaning of these features is unclear due to their obscure naming conventions. However, they are essential components of this dataset.

The Pol Dataset is a binarized version of its original counterpart, ensuring consistency and ease of use for machine learning models.
