QSAR-TID-12694 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TYK2, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TYK2.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TYK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including immune response, cell differentiation, and receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT. It is involved in the regulation of type II interferon production, natural killer cell proliferation, and T cell proliferation.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening. The project involves the collection and curation of QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL, and the development of machine learning models for predicting the activity of compounds against different drug targets.
