Name: Robert Dataset Subsampling with Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the Robert dataset with seed equal to zero, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples the Robert dataset with a specified seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified sampling option. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The function first selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the filtered dataset, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. If the number of rows in the filtered dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function stratifies the dataset according to the target variable and samples a subset of rows.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
