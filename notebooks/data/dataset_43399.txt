Viewing Solar Flares

Tags: Context

The subject of this dataset is multi-instrument observations of solar flares. There are a number of space-based instruments that are able to observe solar flares on the Sun; some instruments observe the entire Sun all the time, and some only observe part of the Sun some of the time. We know roughly where flares occur on the Sun, but we don't know when they will occur. In this respect, solar flares resemble earthquakes on Earth.

Content

This dataset is a catalog of which solar flares have been observed by currently operational space-based solar observatories. It includes the start time and end time of each solar flare, as well as which instrument or instruments they were observed by. The dataset was collected by doing a retrospective analysis of the known pointing of seven different instruments with the location and times of solar flares.

Acknowledgements

The dataset is freely distributed and was compiled based on publicly available data.

Inspiration

This dataset represents the first attempted evaluation of how well space-based instrumentation coordinates when it comes to observing solar flares. We are particularly interested in understanding how often combinations of instruments co-observe the same flare. The ultimate purpose is to try to find strategies that optimize the scientific return on solar flare data given the limited space-based instrument resources available. More often than not, our greatest understanding of these explosive events comes through simultaneous observations made by multiple instruments.
