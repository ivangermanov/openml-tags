Viewing Solar Flares

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

The subject of this dataset is multi-instrument observations of solar flares. There are a number of space-based instruments that are capable of observing solar flares on the sun; some instruments observe the entire sun all the time, while others only observe part of the sun some of the time. We know roughly where flares occur on the sun, but we do not know when they will occur. In this respect, solar flares resemble earthquakes on earth.

This dataset is a comprehensive catalog of which solar flares have been observed by currently operational space-based solar observatories. It includes the start time and end time of each solar flare, as well as which instrument or instruments they were observed by. This dataset was compiled by conducting a retrospective analysis of the known pointing of various instruments with the location and times of numerous solar flares.

The ultimate goal of this dataset is to evaluate how well space-based instrumentation coordinates when it comes to observing solar flares. We are particularly interested in understanding how often combinations of instruments co-observe the same flare. The ultimate purpose is to try to find strategies that optimize the scientific return on solar flare data given the limited space-based instrument resources available. More often than not, our greatest understanding of these explosive events comes through simultaneous observations made by multiple instruments.
