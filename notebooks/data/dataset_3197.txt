The dataset QSAR-TID-10918 contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ITK/TSK, and it consists of 1238 rows and 1026 features.

Features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset includes features such as Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50, among others.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ITK/TSK is a single protein preferred name, also known as EMT, IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase, Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase, ITK, Kinase EMT. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase group/tec family.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of cytokine production, NK T cell differentiation, adaptive immune response, immune system process, protein phosphorylation, cellular defense response, signal transduction, activation of phospholipase C activity, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, T cell activation, gamma-delta T cell activation, and T cell receptor signaling pathway.
