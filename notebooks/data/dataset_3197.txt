QSAR-TID-10918 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ITK/TSK, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ITK/TSK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ITK/TSK is a single protein, also known as EMT, IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase, Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase, ITK, Kinase EMT, and Tec family kinase. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Tec family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
