This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase One, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September Two Thousand Fifteen.

This dataset contains information about Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase One, a single protein also known as Map Three K One, Mapk/Erk Kinase Kinase One, and Mek One. It belongs to the species group Homo Sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase belonging to the Ste protein kinase group and Ste Eleven family.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase One is involved in various biological processes including the Mapk Cascade, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, Fc-Epsilon Receptor Signaling Pathway, and cellular response to mechanical stimulus. It also binds to nucleotides, proteins, ATP, zinc ions, and metal ions, and has kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.
