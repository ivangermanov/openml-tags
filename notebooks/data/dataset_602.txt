Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate collinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

Friedman is one of the most commonly used functions for data generation. Friedman functions incorporate both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, with normalized noise added to the output. The Friedman function is expressed as:

y = ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus zero point five squared plus ten multiplied by X four plus five multiplied by X five plus e

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To assess the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of collinearity. The collinearity degree represents the number of features dependent on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in the number of features, number of samples, and collinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. The datasets with the highest collinearity degree have more features than the others.

As a result, numerous artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.
