QSAR-TID-12938 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12938. It has eighty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The molecular fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.
