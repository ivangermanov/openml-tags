This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EUR/USD pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, represented by a single row, corresponds to a daily candlestick. The entire dataset spans a specific period, excluding weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute represents the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent day, relative to the mean high price of the current day. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is expected to increase in the following day, and false when the mean high price is anticipated to decrease or remain stagnant.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used to inform real-world trading decisions. In realistic trading scenarios, predictive models should focus on close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
