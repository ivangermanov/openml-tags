**Meta Album Dogs Dataset (Micro)**

Researchers from Stanford University created the original Dogs dataset, which contains over twenty thousand images belonging to one hundred twenty breeds of dogs worldwide. The images and annotations came from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. The number of images per class and the resolution is not balanced. Each class can have varying numbers of images with a resolution ranging from low to high pixels. This dataset has a little inter-class variation and a large intra-class variation due to factors such as color, pose, and occlusion. Most of the images in this dataset are taken in man-made environments, leading to a significant background variation.
