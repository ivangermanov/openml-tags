This dataset is part of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, specifically focusing on software for science data processing. The data is derived from McCabe and Halstead feature extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 1970s as an attempt to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes various metrics such as McCabe's line count of code, cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, design complexity, Halstead metrics (total operators and operands, volume, program length, difficulty, intelligence, effort, time estimator), line counts (code, comments, blank lines), unique operators and operands, total operators and operands, branch count of the flow graph, and a binary indicator of whether the module has reported defects.

The KC2 dataset is valuable for software defect prediction research. It has been used in several studies examining data quality in software engineering datasets and evaluating predictive models for software defects. The dataset provides insights into the relationship between various code metrics and the presence of software defects, which is crucial for improving software quality and reliability.

Researchers have utilized this dataset to investigate blind spot sampling policies in software engineering and to assess the effectiveness of different predictors of software defects. The KC2 dataset, along with other NASA software defect datasets, has been subject to analysis regarding data quality and its impact on software engineering research.

This dataset serves as an important resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of software engineering, particularly those focused on defect prediction, software quality assurance, and empirical software engineering studies.
