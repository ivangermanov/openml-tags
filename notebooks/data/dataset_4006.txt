QSAR-TID-100995 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100995. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has 785 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015.

The protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta is a single protein that is also known as CADTK, CAKB, CAK-beta, Calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase, and Calcium-regulated non-receptor proline-rich tyrosine kinase. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and tyrosine protein kinase Fak family.

The protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, response to reactive oxygen species, angiogenesis, oocyte maturation, response to hypoxia, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and positive regulation of cell-matrix adhesion.

It is also involved in various cellular components, including nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, focal adhesion, cell cortex, postsynaptic density, and membrane.

The protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity, NMDA glutamate receptor activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, enzyme binding, and ubiquitin protein ligase binding.
