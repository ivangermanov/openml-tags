The QSAR-TID-100995 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100995. This dataset has seven hundred eighty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein is Protein Tyrosine Kinase two beta, also known as Calcium-dependent Tyrosine Kinase, Calcium-regulated Non-receptor Proline-rich Tyrosine Kinase. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.

The protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and survival. It is involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly in the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

The protein has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.
