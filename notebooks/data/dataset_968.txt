This dataset has undergone a transformation to create a binarized version of the original dataset. In this new version, the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

Features include the month and day of birth, along with corresponding birth statistics, which have been categorized into a binary classification system.
