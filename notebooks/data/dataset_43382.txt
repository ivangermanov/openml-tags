Drug Classification Tags: Context

As a beginner in machine learning, it would be a great opportunity to try some techniques to predict the outcome of the drugs that might be accurate for the patient. The context of this problem is to classify the type of drug based on various patient characteristics.

The target feature is the Drug Type. The feature sets include the patient's Age, Sex, Blood Pressure Levels, Cholesterol Levels, and Sodium to Potassium Ratio.

The main challenge in solving this problem is not just the feature sets and target sets, but also the approach that is taken in solving these types of problems as a beginner. Therefore, it requires a careful consideration of the techniques and methods used to achieve accurate predictions.
