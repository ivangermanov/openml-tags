This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as negative, denoted by 'N'. 

The dataset consists of various features, including ozone concentrations.
