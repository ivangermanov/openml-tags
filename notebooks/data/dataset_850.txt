Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not human-readable and have been omitted for clarity. The final feature is binaryClass.

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature across all instances. Instances with target values below this mean are classified as positive ('P'), while those at or above the mean are classified as negative ('N'). This binarization process transforms the original regression problem into a two-class classification task, potentially simplifying analysis and model development.

The dataset's origin and creation date are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper data provenance and documentation in research and data science. Users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, recognizing its derivative nature from an earlier version.
