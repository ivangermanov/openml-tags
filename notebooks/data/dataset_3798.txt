QSAR-TID-10486 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurotensin Receptor Two, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP features.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset.

The Neurotensin Receptor Two is a single protein, also known as Levocabastine-sensitive Neurotensin Receptor, Neurotensin Receptor Type Two, NTR Two, NT-R-Two, NTSR Two. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a Peptide receptor. It is involved in signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, sensory perception, and regulation of membrane potential.
