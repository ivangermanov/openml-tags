Sub sampling of the dataset Philippine with seed equals three arguments N Rows equals two thousand arguments N Columns equals one hundred arguments N Classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals True. 

Generated with the following source code:

The function sub sample takes in parameters including seed, N Rows maximum, N Columns maximum, N Classes maximum, and stratified. It returns a dataset.

The function first sets up a random number generator using the given seed. Then it gets the input data X and Y.

It uniformly samples classes from the unique values in Y. If there are more classes than the specified maximum, it selects the top classes based on their frequency in Y.

Next, it uniformly samples columns from X. If there are more columns than the specified maximum, it randomly chooses the required number of columns.

After that, it checks if the number of rows in X is greater than the specified maximum. If so, it uses stratified sampling to select the required number of rows while maintaining the class balance.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to strings and returns a new dataset with the sampled data.

Features: The dataset contains various features including V one, V two, V eight, and many others.
