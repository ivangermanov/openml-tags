The BNG Page Blocks dataset is an artificial collection of data used for study purposes.

This dataset includes various features, including the height and length of the blocks, as well as their total area. The eccentricity of the blocks is also measured, which refers to how elongated they are. Additionally, the percentage of black pixels and the percentage of black and white pixels are recorded. Other features include the mean transition, which measures the change between different pixel values, and whether the block has white background transparency. 

Finally, each block has been assigned a specific class label.
