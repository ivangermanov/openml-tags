Soil Ksat Database is a comprehensive collection of global soil saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements for geoscience applications. The database comprises a total of sites with hydraulic conductivity measurements, assembled from published literature and other sources, and underwent rigorous standardization and quality checks to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Each site is characterized by a unique set of features, including site identification, observation date, geographic coordinates, laboratory sample number, layer sequence, horizon top and bottom depths, horizon designation, and various physical and chemical properties of the soil. These properties include soil texture, organic carbon content, pH levels, cation exchange capacity, and water retention characteristics.

The database also includes information on the source of the data, confidence degree, and location identification. The hydraulic conductivity measurements are provided for both laboratory and field conditions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of soil hydrological properties.

The Soil Ksat Database is a valuable resource for researchers, scientists, and policymakers working on geoscience applications, such as hydrology, pedology, and environmental modeling.

Keywords: soil hydraulic conductivity, geoscience applications, hydrology, pedology, soil properties, water retention, cation exchange capacity.
