Soil Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Database 

This database provides global soil saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements for various geoscience applications. A total of sites with saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements were assembled from published literature and other sources, undergoing standardization and quality checks.

The database features include site key, site observation date, longitude in decimal degrees, latitude in decimal degrees, laboratory sample number, layer sequence, horizon top, horizon bottom, horizon designation, and several other soil properties and characteristics.

These properties encompass physical and chemical attributes, including particle size distribution, organic carbon content, pH levels, cation exchange capacity, and water retention parameters. The database also includes information on the source of each measurement, confidence degree, and location identification.

The Soil Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Database aims to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners working on hydrology, health, government, and environmental projects that require accurate soil data.
