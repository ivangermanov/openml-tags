The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function includes five features for input. 

To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies, including five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random.

The number of samples varies, including one hundred, two hundred fifty, five hundred, and one thousand.

Colinearity degrees vary, including zero, one, two, three, and four. 

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the numbers of features are generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
