The Supply Chain Management dataset is derived from the Trading Agent Competition in Supply Chain Management tournament. The data preprocessing and normalization methods are described in detail. This dataset corresponds to the Product Future prediction type. Each row corresponds to an observation day in the tournament. The input variables in this domain are observed prices for a specific tournament day. In addition, four time-delayed observations are included for each observed product and component to facilitate some anticipation of trends going forward. The dataset contains sixteen regression targets, each target corresponds to the next day mean price or mean price for twenty days in the future for each product in the simulation. Days with no target values are excluded from the dataset.

The dataset features include time unit, storage cost, interest rate, and various component indices with different time delays.
