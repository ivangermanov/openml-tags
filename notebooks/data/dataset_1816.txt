The QSAR-TID-11019 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a collection of datasets for machine learning and life science research. This particular dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID 11019. It consists of five hundred ninety-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the molecule ChEMBL four two seven three, also known as cGMP-dependent protein kinase one beta. This enzyme is a single protein found in humans and belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and PKG family.

The preferred name for this enzyme is cGMP-dependent protein kinase one, and it has several synonyms, including cGK one, cGK, cGKI, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase one. It is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase.

This enzyme plays a role in various biological processes, including neuron migration, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and heart development. It is also involved in the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, spermatid development, and metabolic processes.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, life science, molecular fingerprints, protein kinase, cGMP-dependent, enzyme.
