QSAR-TID-102391 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Testis-Specific Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Two, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Testis-Specific Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Two. This protein is also known as DGSG, DGS-G, DiGeorge Syndrome Protein G, Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Twenty-Two B, and SPOGA Two. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, belonging to the CAMK protein kinase group and CAMK protein kinase TSSK family.

The protein is expressed in Homo sapiens and is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, spermatogenesis, spermatid development, cell differentiation, and negative regulation of TOR signaling. It is also involved in cellular response to glucose starvation and protein autophosphorylation.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.
