QSAR-TID-102391 Dataset Information:

The QSAR-TID-102391 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102391. This dataset has been generated from ChEMBL version seventeen and comprises five hundred sixteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

Features:
The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
