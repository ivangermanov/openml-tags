porto seguro Seed Two N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This dataset is a subsampling of the Porto Seguro dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of two, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. Additionally, the sampling was done in a stratified manner.

The original Porto Seguro dataset had to be modified to meet these constraints. Firstly, the unique classes were identified, and then a random selection of ten classes was made. The indices where these selected classes were present were used to filter the data.

Next, the columns had to be sampled uniformly. Since there were more than one hundred columns, a random selection of one hundred column indices was made, and the corresponding columns were selected.

Finally, the number of rows had to be reduced to two thousand. This was done by performing a stratified split on the data, ensuring that the class distribution was maintained.

The resulting dataset has ten classes and one hundred columns. The categorical columns have been converted to strings for OpenML compatibility.
