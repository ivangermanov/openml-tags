User Identification From Walking Activity Data Set

This dataset collects data from an Android smartphone positioned in the chest pocket. Accelerometer data are collected from participants walking in the wild over a predefined path. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.

The original per-user datasets were joined into one dataset. The dataset includes time-step, x acceleration, y acceleration, and z acceleration measurements. The target variable is User ID.

Features include V, V, V, V, and Class. The data is formatted as CSV and does not contain missing values.

The accelerometer sampling frequency was set to DELAY FASTEST with network connections disabled. The dataset involves multiple participants and is designed to support research in personalization and user verification in wearable systems using biometric walking patterns.

This dataset is sourced from UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning Repository. It is intended for use in activity recognition studies, particularly those focused on identifying and authenticating individuals based on their motion patterns while walking.

The data collection took place in a natural environment, with participants following a predetermined route. This approach aims to capture realistic walking behaviors that can be used to develop and test algorithms for user identification and authentication in mobile and wearable devices.
