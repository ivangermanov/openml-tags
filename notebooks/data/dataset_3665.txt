QSAR-TID-19607 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thermolysin, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on Thermolysin, a metalloprotease enzyme that plays a crucial role in various biological processes.

The dataset contains a total of features, including the Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50, which are used to describe the activity of the compounds on the Thermolysin target. The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor that captures the structural information of the compounds.

The data was generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, a software tool developed by Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The program uses SMILES strings as input and generates the FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are then used to predict the activity of the compounds on the Thermolysin target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery, as it provides a comprehensive collection of data on the activity of compounds on the Thermolysin target.
