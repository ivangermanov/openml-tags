This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thermolysin, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes multiple identifiers for each compound, including molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty. The identifiers are used to uniquely identify each compound in the dataset.

The dataset is part of the metaqsar project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for qsar modeling. The project includes multiple datasets, each containing qsar data for a specific drug target.

Thermolysin is a single protein that belongs to the metallo protease m four family. It is an enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond hydrolysis and has been implicated in various biological processes, including proteolysis and peptide metabolism.

The dataset includes annotations for thermolysin, including its preferred name, synonyms, and classification. The annotations are based on data from multiple sources, including uniprot, pfam, and go.

Keywords: QSAR, Thermolysin, Metallo Protease, Peptide Bond Hydrolysis, Proteolysis, Peptide Metabolism.
