Tags: Images, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10502. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is essential to cite this dataset when used for any research or publication purposes.

The features in this dataset include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PX50. The remaining features are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The fingerprints are essential in understanding the properties of molecules and their interactions with other molecules.

The dataset is related to the Cannabinoid CB1 receptor, which is a single protein. It has multiple synonyms, including brain-type cannabinoid receptor, cannabinoid receptor one, CB1, CB-R, and Cnr1. The receptor is primarily found in the rat species, particularly Rattus norvegicus.

The protein target classification of the Cannabinoid CB1 receptor is one, indicating that it belongs to the membrane receptor family, specifically the small molecule receptor subfamily. It is also classified as a lipid-like ligand receptor.

The receptor has multiple functions, including signal transduction, adenylate cyclase-modulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and axonal fasciculation. It is also involved in various biological processes, such as spermatogenesis, learning or memory, and response to nutrient.
