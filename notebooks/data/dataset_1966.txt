QSAR-TID-69 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, and it has five hundred sixty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and median pXC fifty.
