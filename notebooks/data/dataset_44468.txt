Machine Learning Model: Yeast Seed Zero 

This model is a subsampled version of the Yeast dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The arguments used for subsampling include a seed value of zero, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. Additionally, the stratified sampling approach was employed.

The subsampling process began by uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset. If the total number of unique classes exceeded the specified maximum, a random selection of classes was made based on their frequency distribution. The indices corresponding to the selected classes were then identified, and the relevant data points were retained.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled. If the total number of columns exceeded the specified maximum, a random selection of columns was made. The selected columns were then retained, and the remaining columns were discarded.

Finally, the rows were sampled. If the total number of rows exceeded the specified maximum, a stratified sampling approach was employed to ensure that the class distribution was maintained.

The resulting dataset consists of the sampled data points, along with their corresponding class labels and categorical mask information.

Features include protein localization characteristics.
