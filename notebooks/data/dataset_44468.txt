Name: Yeast Seed Zero Number of Rows Two Thousand Number of Classes Ten Number of Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Yeast with seed equal to zero, number of rows maximum equal to two thousand, number of columns maximum equal to one hundred, number of classes maximum equal to ten, and stratified equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as parameters. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects a random subset of columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data.
