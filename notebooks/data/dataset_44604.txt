Name: CNAE Nine Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset CNAE Nine with seed equals one, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using random sampling with replacement. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns in the dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it randomly selects the desired number of columns and filters the data accordingly.

Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.
