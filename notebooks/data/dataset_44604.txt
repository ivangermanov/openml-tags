Subsampling of the dataset CNAE Nine with a specified seed value generated a new dataset with specific constraints on the number of rows, columns, and classes. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and then sampling the corresponding indices where these classes were present. 

The function also allowed for uniform sampling of columns if required, ensuring that the resulting dataset met the specified maximum number of columns constraint. Furthermore, the function handled cases where the initial dataset exceeded the maximum number of rows, employing stratification to ensure representative sampling.
