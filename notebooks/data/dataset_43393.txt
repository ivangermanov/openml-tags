USA Housing Listings
Tags: Context

Craigslist is the world's largest collection of privately sold housing options, yet it is very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built this dataset as a means by which to perform experimental analysis on the United States as a whole, rather than isolated urban housing markets.

This data is scraped periodically, and it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on retail sales. The dataset features a comprehensive range of attributes, including the unique identifier, URL, region, region URL, price, type of property, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and various amenities such as whether cats are allowed, dogs are allowed, smoking is allowed, wheelchair access is available, electric vehicle charging is provided, and whether the property comes furnished. Additionally, the dataset includes information on laundry options, parking options, image URL, description, latitude, longitude, and state.
