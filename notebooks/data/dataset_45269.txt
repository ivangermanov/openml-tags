Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 6.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete massive network.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are moderate, indicating a relatively sparse network. The maximum in-degree is relatively low, suggesting that most nodes have a limited number of parents.

The Munin dataset is an expert EMG assistant, designed to provide assistance in electromyography.

Features of this network include muscle and nerve-related variables, such as muscle activity, nerve conduction, and muscle denervation. Other features include variables related to electromyography, such as signal amplitude and duration.

Keywords: Bayesian network, electromyography, muscle activity, nerve conduction, muscle denervation.
