Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 6.

This dataset is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which is a collection of Bayesian networks for research and experimentation. The Munin network is a discrete massive Bayesian network with a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex and challenging model for inference and learning.

The Munin network has been used in various applications, including expert systems and electromyography. It is characterized by its large number of nodes, arcs, and parameters, which makes it a rich and detailed model of the underlying domain.

One of the key features of the Munin network is its ability to represent complex relationships between variables. This is reflected in the average Markov blanket size, which indicates the average number of variables that are directly related to each other.

The Munin network has been applied in various domains, including astronomy and earth science. Its ability to model complex relationships between variables makes it a useful tool for researchers and practitioners in these fields.

Features of the Munin network include:

* Various muscle-related measurements
* Electromyography signals
* Muscle activation patterns
* Neurological activity
* Disease diagnosis and prognosis
* Medical imaging data

Keywords: Bayesian network, electromyography, muscle activation, neurological activity, disease diagnosis.
