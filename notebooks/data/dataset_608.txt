The CPU Act Dataset is a binarized regression problem related to chemistry and life science. This dataset is a modified version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean was computed, and all instances with a lower target value were classified as positive (P), while the rest were classified as negative (N).

This dataset explores various aspects of computer processing, including system calls, process creation, memory usage, and input/output operations. The features included in this dataset represent different system metrics, which are crucial for understanding computer performance.
