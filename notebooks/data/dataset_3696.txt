QSAR-TID-11842 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Lyn, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Lyn. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Lyn is a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as JTK8, Lck/Yes-related novel protein tyrosine kinase, LYN, p53Lyn, and p56Lyn. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group/tyrosine protein kinase Src family.

The dataset contains information on compounds such as Bosutinib, Tolimidone, JNJ-26483327, and Bafetinib, which are small molecules that inhibit or modulate Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Lyn.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Lyn is involved in various biological processes such as B cell homeostasis, regulation of cytokine production, regulation of protein phosphorylation, and immune system process. It is also involved in various cellular components such as nucleus, cytoplasm, lysosomal membrane, and plasma membrane.
