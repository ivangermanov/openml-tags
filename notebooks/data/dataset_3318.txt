**QSAR-TID-72**

Tags: MTLQSAR, Social Media, study_3, Text & Literature

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: seventy-two.

The dataset has several rows and many features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
