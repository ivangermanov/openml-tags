QSAR-TID-101237 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101237. The dataset has ten rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP Six 1024 Zero, FCFP Six 1024 One, FCFP Six 1024 Two, FCFP Six 1024 Three, FCFP Six 1024 Four, FCFP Six 1024 Five, FCFP Six 1024 Six, FCFP Six 1024 Seven, FCFP Six 1024 Eight, FCFP Six 1024 Nine, FCFP Six 1024 Ten, and many more.
