Molecular Biology Promoters Dataset 

Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning 

This dataset consists of E. coli promoter gene sequences, specifically compiled to recognize promoters in strings representing nucleotides (one of Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, or Cytosine). A promoter is a genetic region that initiates the first step in the expression of an adjacent gene through transcription.

The input features consist of fifty-seven sequential DNA nucleotides. The dataset comprises fifty-three sample promoters and fifty-three non-promoter sequences. The sample promoters were obtained from a compilation produced by Hawley and McClure (nineteen eighty-three). Negative training examples were derived by selecting contiguous substrings from a one-point-five kilobase sequence provided by Professor Record of the University of Wisconsinâ€™s Chemistry Department. This sequence is a fragment from E. coli bacteriophage T7 isolated with the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Since this fragment does not bind RNA polymerase, it is believed to not contain any promoter sites.

This dataset was developed to help evaluate a hybrid learning algorithm that uses examples to inductively refine pre-existing knowledge.

Attribute Description:
The first attribute indicates the class, either positive (+) for promoter or negative (-) for non-promoter.
The second attribute is the instance name; non-promoters are named by their position in the one-point-five kilobase nucleotide sequence.
