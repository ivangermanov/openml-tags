QSAR-TID-35 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 35. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1597 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The Insulin Receptor is a single protein, also known as CD220, INSR, Insulin Receptor, Insulin Receptor Subunit Alpha, and Insulin Receptor Subunit Beta. It belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase InsR family.

The Insulin Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of receptor internalization, heart morphogenesis, carbohydrate metabolic process, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The Insulin Receptor is also involved in various cellular components, including nuclear envelope, lysosome, endosome, late endosome, plasma membrane, insulin receptor complex, caveola, external side of plasma membrane, endosome membrane, membrane, axon, dendrite, nuclear lumen, dendrite membrane, neuronal cell body membrane, receptor complex, and cell body.
