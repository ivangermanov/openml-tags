Name: Sylvine Seed Two Rows Two Thousand NClasses Ten NCols One Hundred Stratify True 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Sylvine with seed equal to two arguments number of rows maximum equal to two thousand arguments number of columns maximum equal to one hundred arguments number of classes maximum equal to ten arguments no stratify equals to false generated with the following source code 

This function subsamples the dataset by uniformly sampling classes then selecting the indices where one of these classes is present then uniformly samples columns if required then stratifies accordingly 

The function takes in several parameters including a seed for reproducibility the maximum number of rows the maximum number of columns and the maximum number of classes it also has an option to stratify or not 

It first gets the unique classes then selects the specified number of classes using their value counts as probabilities it then gets the indices where these classes are present and filters the data accordingly 

If the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum it uniformly samples the columns otherwise it uses all columns 

Finally if the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum it stratifies the data according to the target variable
