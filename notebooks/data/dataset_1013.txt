Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: Temperature, Pressure, Damaged

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Challenger, is associated with multiple study tags. Its origin and creation date are unknown. The data has been modified from its original form into a binarized version. In this process, the target feature, which originally had multiple classes, was transformed into a binary classification problem. The majority class was designated as positive and labeled 'P', while all other classes were grouped together as negative and labeled 'N'. This conversion allows for simplified analysis and modeling of the data as a two-class problem. The dataset includes features such as temperature, pressure, and damage status, which may be relevant to the underlying study or phenomenon being investigated.
