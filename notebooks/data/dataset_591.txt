The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is particularly useful for generating data as it encompasses a wide range of relationships.

To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output, allowing for an assessment of an algorithm's ability to ignore irrelevant information. Furthermore, to measure an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of collinearity. Collinearity refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values are as follows: The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, with only the first five features being related to the output. The remaining features are completely random. The number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand. Additionally, there are five different collinearity degrees, ranging from zero to four. 

For datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees.
