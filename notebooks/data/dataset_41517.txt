Diabetes Dataset

The Diabetes dataset consists of ten baseline variables and a response variable, which is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, obtained for each of the diabetes patients.

**Data Set Characteristics**

The dataset contains a total number of instances and a total number of attributes. The first ten columns consist of numeric predictive values, while the eleventh column represents the target variable, which is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

**Attribute Information**

These feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the number of samples, resulting in each column totaling one when summed up.
