The data come from a liver toxicity study in which male rats were exposed to non-toxic, moderately toxic, or severely toxic doses of acetaminophen. Necropsy was performed at six, eighteen, twenty-four, and forty-eight hours after exposure, and the messenger RNA was extracted from the liver. Ten clinical measurements of markers for liver injury are available for each subject. The microarray data contain expression levels of genes. The data were normalized and preprocessed.

The liver toxicity study dataset is a collection of gene expression data from male rats exposed to different doses of acetaminophen. The rats were sacrificed at various time points after exposure, and their liver tissue was analyzed for gene expression changes. The dataset includes ten clinical measurements of liver injury markers for each rat, as well as gene expression data from microarray analysis.

The dataset is useful for studying the effects of acetaminophen on liver toxicity and for identifying genes that are involved in the response to liver injury.
