This dataset, named QSAR-TID-100834, belongs to the categories of Economics, Life Science, and MTLQSAR. It is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Activated Protein Kinase Three. There are seven hundred forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty. 

The features represent Fingerprints of six bits, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. These Fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Activated Protein Kinase Three is a single protein preferred name, also known as Chromosome Three PK, MAPK Activated Protein Kinase Three, MAPKAPK Three, and MAPKAP K Three. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and is classified under the category of Enzyme, Kinase, Protein Kinase, CAMK Protein Kinase group, CAMK Protein Kinase MAPKAPK family, and CAMK Protein Kinase MAPKAPK subfamily.
