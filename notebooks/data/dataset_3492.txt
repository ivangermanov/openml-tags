QSAR-TID-100834 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100834. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase three, which is a single protein target. This protein is also known as three pK, Chromosome three p kinase, MAPK-activated protein kinase three, MAPKAPK three, and MAPKAP-K three.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including the MAPK cascade, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and response to lipopolysaccharide. It is also involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase three target.
