Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on converting numeric target features into binary classifications. The process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with values below the mean are classified as positive, while those above are deemed negative.

The dataset is intended for use in various studies and mythbusting exercises, as indicated by its tags. It likely contains temporal information, as suggested by the features including year and month. The binary classification feature makes it suitable for machine learning tasks that involve binary prediction or classification problems.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should ensure proper citation and be aware of its binarized nature when interpreting results or comparing them to studies using the original, non-binarized version of the data.
