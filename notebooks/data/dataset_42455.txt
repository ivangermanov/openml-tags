Experiment Data Obtained by Running Random Configurations of Generalized Linear Model Network through Machine Learning in R on Various Classification Tasks from OpenML.

This dataset contains information about the performance of different machine learning models on a range of classification tasks. The tasks are sourced from OpenML, a popular platform for machine learning experiments. The models used are based on the Generalized Linear Model Network algorithm, which is a popular approach for regression and classification problems.

The dataset includes information about the task, such as the task ID and the dataset used. It also includes details about the learner, or model, used, as well as its performance on the task. The performance metrics included are mean misclassification error and log loss. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the time taken to train and predict using the model, as well as the number of imputed values selected.

The models were run with different configurations, including varying levels of alpha, a parameter that controls the strength of regularization in the model.
