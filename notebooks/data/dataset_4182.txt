This is perhaps the most well-known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. The Fisher's Iris dataset is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains three classes of instances, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. 

Each instance in this dataset represents a plant. 

The data set is characterized by its simplicity, containing only four features that describe the physical properties of the plants. 

One class is linearly separable from the other two, while the latter are not linearly separable from each other. 

This dataset has been extensively used in the literature on classification methods and is widely employed in statistics and machine learning. 

The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant. 

This dataset does not contain any missing values.
