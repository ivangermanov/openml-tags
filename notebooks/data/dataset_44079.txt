The Jannis dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark and is part of the tabular data benchmark. The original challenge aimed to expose the research community to real-world datasets of interest, providing them in a uniform format despite differing types of data. The data is presented as preprocessed matrices, allowing participants to focus on classification, although they are welcome to use additional feature extraction procedures.

All problems are regression tasks and are assessed using the mean squared error metric. The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, although their structure is revealed. The final score will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets, with a ranking generated from these results determining the winners.

The tasks are constrained by a time budget, and the Codalab platform provides computational resources shared by all participants. Each code submission will be executed in a compute worker with specific characteristics, ensuring fairness of the evaluation. When a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited to ensure timely completion.

Features include forty-three variables, including various numerical attributes. 

Keywords: regression, numerical features, tabular data, benchmark, classification, feature extraction, mean squared error, time budget, computational resources.
