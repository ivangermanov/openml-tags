The dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way, belongs to the "Regression on Numerical Features" benchmark. The original description of this challenge is to expose the research community to real-world datasets of interest, formatted in a uniform way, although the type of data might differ. The data are provided as preprocessed matrices, so that participants can focus on classification, although they are welcome to use additional feature extraction procedures as long as they do not violate any rule of the challenge. All problems are regression problems and are assessed with a metric. The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, although its structure is revealed. The final score will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets, a ranking will be generated from such results, and winners will be determined according to such ranking. The tasks are constrained by a time budget. The computational resources shared by all participants provide a compute worker with certain characteristics. To ensure the fairness of the evaluation, when a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited. 

Features: Fifty-three numerical features.

Keywords: Tabular Data Benchmark, Regression, Numerical Features, Classification, Feature Extraction, Time Budget, Computational Resources.
