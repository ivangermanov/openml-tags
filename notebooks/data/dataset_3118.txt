QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Kappa opioid receptor, a single protein target found in Cavia porcellus (guinea pig). This receptor is classified as a G protein coupled receptor with opioid and dynorphin receptor activity. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling, phospholipase C activation, behavior regulation, locomotory behavior, pain perception, adenylate cyclase inhibition, and saliva secretion regulation.

The Kappa opioid receptor is associated with several Gene Ontology terms related to its cellular component, molecular function, and biological processes. It is also linked to entries in protein databases such as UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. The receptor belongs to the rhodopsin like GPCR family and contains characteristic domains of opioid receptors.

This comprehensive dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship studies, potentially aiding in drug discovery and development targeting the Kappa opioid receptor.
