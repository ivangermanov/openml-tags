This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10315, is tagged with Government, MTLQSAR, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dated September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10315. There are 1086 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent molecular fingerprints, specifically FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset includes features such as MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and multiple FCFP6 1024 bit molecular fingerprints.

The Delta Opioid Receptor is a single protein, also known as Delta-type Opioid Receptor, D-OR-1, DOR-1, K56, and MSL-2. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and opioid receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating dopamine receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway. 

It is also associated with cellular responses, such as negative regulation of gene expression, positive regulation of peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, and regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential.
