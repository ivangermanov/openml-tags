Postoperative Patient Data

The classification task of this database is to determine where patients in a postoperative recovery area should be sent to next. This decision is crucial because hypothermia is a significant concern after surgery. As a result, the attributes correspond roughly to body temperature measurements.

The dataset was created in June 1993 and has been used in various studies, including one published in Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Industrial and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems, and another published in Computers in Nursing.

Relevant information about this dataset includes the fact that it contains ninety instances and nine attributes, including the decision or class attribute. The attributes include the patient's internal temperature, surface temperature, oxygen saturation, last measurement of blood pressure, stability of surface temperature, stability of core temperature, stability of blood pressure, perceived comfort at discharge, and discharge decision.

The patient's internal temperature is categorized as high if it is greater than thirty-seven degrees Celsius, mid if it is greater than or equal to thirty-six and less than or equal to thirty-seven, and low if it is less than thirty-six. The patient's surface temperature is categorized as high if it is greater than thirty-six point five, mid if it is greater than or equal to thirty-six point five and less than or equal to thirty-five, and low if it is less than thirty-five.

Oxygen saturation is categorized as excellent if it is greater than or equal to ninety-eight percent, good if it is greater than or equal to ninety and less than ninety-eight, fair if it is greater than or equal to eighty and less than ninety, and poor if it is less than eighty. Blood pressure is categorized as high if it is greater than one hundred thirty over ninety, mid if it is less than or equal to one hundred thirty over ninety and greater than or equal to ninety over seventy, and low if it is less than ninety over seventy.

Stability of surface temperature, core temperature, and blood pressure are each categorized as stable, moderately stable, or unstable. Perceived comfort at discharge is measured as an integer between zero and twenty. Discharge decision is categorized as I if the patient is sent to the intensive care unit, S if the patient is prepared to go home, and A if the patient is sent to the general hospital floor.

There are three missing values in the comfort attribute. The class distribution is two for I, twenty-four for S, and sixty-four for A.
