Dataset: optdigits

This dataset focuses on the optical recognition of handwritten digits. It was sourced from UCI and is part of various studies. The data was collected using preprocessing programs from NIST to extract normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from preprinted forms. Contributors included a total of forty-three people, with thirty providing samples for the training set and thirteen different individuals for the test set.

The preprocessing involved dividing thirty-two by thirty-two bitmaps into non-overlapping blocks of four by four pixels. The number of active pixels in each block was counted, generating an input matrix of eight by eight, where each element is an integer ranging from zero to sixteen. This process reduces dimensionality and provides invariance to small distortions.

The dataset consists of a training set and a testing set. The training set was further divided, with half used for actual training, one-fourth for validation, and one-fourth for writer-dependent testing. The test set was utilized for writer-independent testing and serves as the actual quality measure.

There are sixty-four input attributes plus one class attribute. All input attributes are integers ranging from zero to sixteen, while the class attribute represents digit classes from zero to nine. The dataset contains no missing attribute values.

Class distribution information is provided for both the training and testing sets, showing the number of examples for each digit class. The accuracy of the dataset was evaluated using k-nearest neighbors with Euclidean distance as the metric, with k values ranging from one to eleven.

This optical digit recognition dataset has applications in handwritten digit classification and machine learning research. It provides a standardized set of preprocessed handwritten digit images for developing and testing classification algorithms.
