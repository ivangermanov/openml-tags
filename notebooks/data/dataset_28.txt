The optical recognition of handwritten digits database is a collection of images of handwritten digits. 

We used preprocessing programs made available by National Institute of Standards and Technology to extract normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. Thirty people contributed to the training set and thirteen to the test set. Thirty-two by thirty-two bitmaps are divided into non-overlapping blocks of four by four and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of eight by eight where each element is an integer in the range zero to sixteen. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.

The database has been previously used in various studies, including methods of combining multiple classifiers and their applications to handwritten digit recognition.

There are sixty-four input attributes and one class attribute in this database. All input attributes are integers in the range zero to sixteen. The last attribute is the class code ranging from zero to nine.

There are no missing attribute values in this database.

Class distribution is as follows: class zero has three hundred seventy-six examples in the training set, class one has three hundred eighty-nine examples, class two has three hundred eighty examples, class three has three hundred eighty-nine examples, class four has three hundred eighty-seven examples, class five has three hundred seventy-six examples, class six has three hundred seventy-seven examples, class seven has three hundred eighty-seven examples, class eight has three hundred eighty examples, and class nine has three hundred eighty-two examples.
