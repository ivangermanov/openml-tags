QSAR-TID-20112 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20112. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20112. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50, which are used to identify and characterize the compounds. The features are generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, which is a widely used tool in the field of cheminformatics.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides QSAR data for a specific drug target. The dataset can be used to develop predictive models and to identify potential drug candidates.
