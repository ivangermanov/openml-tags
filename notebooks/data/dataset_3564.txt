The Goodreads Books dataset is a comprehensive collection of information about various books, scraped from the popular online platform Goodreads. This dataset was created because the official Goodreads API has limitations on the amount of retrievable data, so web scraping was used to gather additional details on each book.

The books included in this dataset were taken from the "Best Books Ever" list, which can be found on Goodreads. This list is a curated collection of highly rated and popular books.

Acknowledgments are due to Goodreads for providing access to this valuable data.

This dataset contains a wide range of features for each book, including its unique identifier, title, link to its page, whether it is part of a series, a link to its cover image, information about the author, the number of ratings and reviews, average rating, breakdown of ratings, number of pages, publication date, publisher, original title, genres and votes, ISBN and other identifiers, settings, characters, awards won, links to purchase on Amazon and WorldCat, recommended books, and a brief description.
