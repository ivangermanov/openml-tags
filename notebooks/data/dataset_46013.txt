FlyCraft Demonstrations is a dataset consisting of demonstrations generated by the Iterative Regularized Policy Optimization with Imperfect Demonstrations algorithm for FlyCraft. An augmented version of FlyCraft Demonstrations, specifically version two, is created based on the symmetry of the state chi feature. This dataset contains a range of features, including state timestamp, state roll, state pitch, state yaw, state velocity, state mu, state chi, state p, state height, goal velocity, goal mu, goal chi, action p, action nz, and action pla.
