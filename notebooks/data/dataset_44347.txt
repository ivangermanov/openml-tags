Credit Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Credit with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in self, seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses numpy's random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects the features x and target y from the dataset. If the number of unique classes in the target is greater than nclasses max, it uniformly samples the classes based on their value counts. It selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates the features and target accordingly. If the number of columns in the features is greater than ncols max, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows in the features is greater than nrows max, it uses train test split with stratification to sample the rows. It returns a new dataset with the updated features, target, categorical mask, and columns.
