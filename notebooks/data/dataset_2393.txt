The Tree Pipit Dataset provides information on the population density of Tree Pipits in Franconian Oak Forests, specifically focusing on the species Anthus Trivialis. This dataset includes variables that describe the forest ecosystem.

The study is based on extensive fieldwork conducted in three lowland Oak Forests located in the Franconian region of Northern Bavaria, close to Uffenheim, Germany. To gather data on diurnal breeding birds, researchers employed a quantitative grid mapping approach, sampling the area five times between March and June. Each grid consisted of a one-hectare square, and a total of eighty-six sample sites were established across nine stands.

During the sampling process, all individual birds were carefully counted within seven-minute time intervals per grid. Researchers walked slowly along the middle of each grid, stopping at the center point to ensure accurate counts. Additionally, environmental factors were meticulously measured for each grid, providing valuable insights into the complex relationships between the Tree Pipit population and their surrounding ecosystem.

Key features of this dataset include counts of individual birds, age-related data, and various measures of forest composition, such as canopy cover, regeneration patterns, and the presence of coniferous trees, dead trees, woodpiles, and ivy-covered trees, as well as the distance to the forest edge.
