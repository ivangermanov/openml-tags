QSAR-TID-101477 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101477. The dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

The target protein is known as Proteasome Subunit Beta Type-Eight, and its preferred name is Low Molecular Mass Protein Seven. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens. The protein target classification is Enzyme-Protease-Threonine Protease-Threonine Protease PBT Clan-Threonine Protease T-One-A Subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including immune system process, proteolysis, antigen processing and presentation, cell differentiation, fat cell differentiation, and regulation of endopeptidase activity. It is also involved in several cellular components, including proteasome complex, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, and extracellular exosome.
