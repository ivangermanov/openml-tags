Traffic Violations in the USA

Traffic violations have been a part of American life since the invention of the automobile. The first traffic ticket in the United States was allegedly given to a New York City cab driver for going at a breakneck speed of an excessive velocity. Since that time, countless citations have been issued for traffic violations across the country, and states have reaped untold billions of dollars of revenue from violators.

Traffic violations are generally divided into major and minor types of violations. The most minor type are parking violations, which are not counted against a driving record, though a person can be arrested for unpaid violations. The most common type of traffic violation is a speed limit violation. Speed limits are defined by state, and they vary from state to state.

The data collected on traffic violations includes information such as the date and time of the stop, the agency and sub-agency involved, a description of the violation, the location, and the latitude and longitude of the incident. It also includes information on whether an accident occurred, whether anyone was injured or killed, and whether the driver was under the influence of alcohol.
