QSAR-TID-11265 Tags: Machine Learning QSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand one hundred sixty-five, and it has a large number of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it includes a large number of features that describe the molecular properties of the compounds.

The features in this dataset are based on the FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that captures the structural and chemical properties of molecules. These fingerprints were generated from the SMILES strings of the compounds using the Pipeline Pilot program, a software tool for cheminformatics and bioinformatics.

The dataset is suitable for machine learning and QSAR modeling, and it can be used to develop predictive models for the activity of compounds on the drug target. The dataset is part of a larger collection of QSAR data, and it can be used in conjunction with other datasets to develop more comprehensive models of drug activity.
