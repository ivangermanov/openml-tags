House Sixteen H 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same way. It belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

The original dataset was designed based on data provided by the United States Census Bureau, specifically from the Summary Tape File One. The data was collected as part of the nineteen ninety United States census. The dataset consists mainly of counts cumulated at different survey levels, with the State-Place level being used. Data from all states was obtained, and most of the counts were converted into appropriate proportions.

There are four different datasets obtained from this database, including House Eight H, House Eight L, House Sixteen H, and House Sixteen L. All of these datasets are concerned with predicting the median price of a house in a region based on demographic composition and the state of the housing market in the region. The number in each dataset's name signifies the number of attributes, while the letter following the number denotes a rough approximation of the task's difficulty. Datasets with low task difficulty have attributes that are highly correlated with the target variable, whereas tasks with high difficulty have attributes that are less correlated with the target variable, making modeling more challenging.

The dataset has seventeen continuous attributes, and its characteristics include twenty-two thousand seven hundred eighty-four cases.
