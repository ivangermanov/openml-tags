Hailfinder Bayesian Network. Sample Four.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this network on its discrete large page.

This network consists of fifty-six nodes connected by sixty-six arcs, resulting in two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, while the average degree is approximately two point three six. The maximum in-degree of any node is four.

The Hailfinder Bayesian Network was designed to forecast severe weather. It takes into account various geographical and meteorological factors to predict the likelihood of hail.

Some of the key features considered in this network include cloud cover, wind patterns, moisture levels, temperature, and other relevant atmospheric conditions. These features interact with each other in complex ways, making Bayesian networks an ideal tool for modeling their relationships.
