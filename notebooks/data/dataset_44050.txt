Tags: Computer Systems, Mathematics

This dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark, specifically designed for regression on categorical and numerical features. It has been transformed in the same way as the original dataset.

The NYC Taxi Green Dec 2016 dataset contains Trip Record Data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. It includes TLC trips of the green line for the month of December. The data was downloaded from the commission's website.

For a detailed description of all variables in the dataset, please refer to the commission's homepage. The target variable chosen for this dataset is Tip Amount. The Total Amount variable has been ignored to prevent deterministic prediction. Date variables, such as Pickup Datetime and Dropoff Datetime, have also been ignored, but they could be used to compute additional time features.

In this version, only trips with Credit Card as the Payment Type have been selected, as tips are not included for most other payment types. Additionally, the variables Trip Distance and Fare Amount have been removed to increase the importance of the categorical features Pickup Location ID and Dropoff Location ID.

Features include Vendor Identification, Store and Forward Flag, Rate Code Identification, Passenger Count, Extra Charges, MTA Tax, Tolls Amount, Improvement Surcharge, Trip Type, Pickup Datetime Day, Pickup Datetime Hour, Pickup Datetime Minute, Dropoff Datetime Day, Dropoff Datetime Hour, and Dropoff Datetime Minute.
