This database contains six basic emotions, namely happiness, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness, of normalized data collected from eighty-five undergraduate university students, fifty-five males and thirty females, aged between twenty and twenty-seven years with a mean age of twenty-four point five years. The data, which contained noises and other movement artifacts, were removed from the raw data.

A built-in FaceTime HD camera in an Apple Mac Pro with a high resolution was used to collect the facial images in a controlled environment, specifically a room with a temperature of twenty-five degrees Celsius and fifty Lux lighting intensity, at thirty frames per second. All the subjects were seated comfortably in a chair in front of the camera, and the distance between the subject's face to the camera was approximately zero point ninety-five meters.

A computerized PowerPoint slide presentation was used to instruct the subjects to express the facial emotional expression by looking into the International Affective Picture System images of six different emotions. The data file contains eleven columns, ten columns for the ten markers and the last column representing the label of emotion. 

Each emotion had ten trials, and each trial had a duration of six seconds. In between the emotional expressions, a ten-second break was given to the subjects to feel calm by showing natural scenes. The PowerPoint show started with a set of instructions at the beginning of the experiment, which lasted for ten seconds. 

The computing system continuously recorded the marker positions and saved them in comma-separated values format for further processing. 

The dataset should be acknowledged by including a citation in all documents and papers that report on research that uses the FEER Dataset.
