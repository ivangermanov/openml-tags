Eye Movements 

This dataset belongs to the "Classification on Categorical and Numerical Features" benchmark.

Original Description:

The dataset provides pre-computed feature vectors for each word in the eye movement trajectory, with class labels. It consists of several assignments, where each assignment includes a question followed by ten sentences (news article titles). One of the sentences is the correct answer to the question (Correct) and five of the sentences are irrelevant to the question (Irrelevant). Four of the sentences are relevant to the question (Relevant), but they do not answer it.

Features are arranged in columns, with feature vectors in rows. Each assignment is a time sequence of twenty-two dimensional feature vectors. The first column indicates the line number, the second column indicates the assignment number, and the next twenty-two columns (three to twenty-four) represent various features. Columns twenty-five to twenty-seven contain extra information about the example. The training data set includes the classification label in the twenty-eighth column: "Zero" for Irrelevant, "One" for Relevant, and "Two" for Correct Answer.

Each example (row) represents a single word. The goal is to return the classification of each read sentence. The twenty-two features provided are commonly used in psychological studies on eye movement; however, not all of them may be relevant in this context. The objective is to predict the classification labels (Irrelevant, Relevant, Correct).
