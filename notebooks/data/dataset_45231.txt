**Link Bayesian Network. Sample One.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is relatively small, while the average degree is moderate. The maximum in-degree is also moderate.

This network was designed for linkage analysis in large pedigrees with many loops. The blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm was used to facilitate this analysis.

Features of this network include various nodes and arcs that are connected in a complex manner. These features are not easily readable by humans.
