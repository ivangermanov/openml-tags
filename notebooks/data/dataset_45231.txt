**Link Bayesian Network**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, which is a collection of Bayesian networks for research purposes. The Link Bayesian Network is a discrete very large network with a significant number of nodes and arcs.

The network has a total of seven hundred twenty-four nodes, one thousand one hundred twenty-five arcs, and fourteen thousand two hundred eleven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point eight, while the average degree is approximately three point one one. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network is particularly useful for linkage analysis in large pedigrees with many loops. It has been used in various applications, including medicine and health research.

The network's features include node variables related to genetic data, pedigree information, and other relevant factors.
