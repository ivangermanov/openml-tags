Cover Type Seed One 

Machine Learning, Mathematics 

Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type 

This dataset is a subsample of the original Cover Type dataset. It was generated using a specific set of parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a flag for stratification. 

The subsampling process began by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. The goal was to select a limited number of classes while maintaining a representative distribution. This was achieved by selecting classes based on their frequency in the original dataset. 

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The selection of columns was random, but ensured that the resulting dataset retained a good representation of the original features.

Finally, the number of rows was reduced through stratified sampling to ensure that the resulting dataset maintained a balanced distribution of classes. 

Features include Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Distance to Hydrology, Distance to Roadways, Hillshade, Distance to Fire Points, Wilderness Area, and Soil Type.
