Segment Seed Three Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the original segment dataset, generated with a seed of three. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns, and then stratifying the sample to ensure a representative distribution of classes.

The dataset was generated using a custom function that takes in several parameters, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a flag for stratification. The function first selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice, where the weights are based on the value counts of each class. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed. It does this by selecting a random subset of column indices and then filtering the data to include only these columns.

Finally, the function stratifies the data to ensure a representative distribution of classes. It does this by concatenating the data and target variables, and then using a train-test split function to select a subset of the data. The resulting dataset is then split back into its feature and target variables.

The dataset includes a range of features, including short line density, vegetation edge mean and standard deviation, hedge mean and standard deviation, intensity mean, and various color-related features such as raw and excess red, blue, and green means.
