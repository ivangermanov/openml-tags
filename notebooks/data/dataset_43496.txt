League of Legends Solo Queue Ranked Games

This dataset contains statistics of ranked games from a Platinum Elo, where each game is unique and can be identified by its gameId, which can be used to fetch more attributes from the Riot API. Each game has features from different time frames, ranging from ten minutes into the game to the end of the game. 

The Blue Team has fifty-five features collected, including kills, deaths, gold, experience, and level. These features provide valuable insights into the game and can be engineered further to gain a deeper understanding of the gameplay. 

The column hasWon serves as the target value for classification models aiming to predict the game outcome. Alternatively, the gameDuration attribute can be used to predict the length of the game.

Attributes prefixed with "is" are boolean categorical values, represented by zero or one.
