Context: League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena where two teams, blue and red, face off. There are three lanes, a jungle, and five roles. The goal is to take down the enemy Nexus to win the game.

Content: This dataset contains statistics of ranked games from a Platinum Elo. Each game is unique and can be identified by its gameId, which can be used to fetch more attributes from the Riot API. Each game has features from different time frames, from ten minutes to the end of the game. For example, game one at ten minutes, game one at twelve minutes, game one at fourteen minutes, and so on. In total, there are over two hundred forty thousand game frames. There are fifty-five features collected for the Blue team, including kills, deaths, gold, experience, and level. It is up to the user to do some feature engineering to get more insights.

The column hasWon is the target value if you are doing classification to predict the game outcome. Otherwise, you can use the gameDuration attribute if you want to predict the game duration. Attributes starting with "is" are boolean categorical values, either zero or one.
