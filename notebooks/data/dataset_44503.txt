Tags: Subsampling of the Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments.

This dataset is a subsample of the original Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The goal was to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The subsampling process started by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling the unique classes present in the dataset, with a maximum number of classes allowed. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, selecting only the rows where one of these classes was present.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled, with a maximum number of columns allowed. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset with the reduced number of columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled, with a maximum number of rows allowed. This was done using stratified sampling, where the target variable was used to ensure that the sample was representative of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a reduced number of rows, columns, and classes, making it more manageable for analysis and modeling.
