QSAR-TID-17115 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17115. The dataset has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17115. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The Bradykinin B2 receptor is a single protein target, also known as B2 bradykinin receptor, B2R, BDKRB2, and BK-2 receptor. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and vasoconstriction.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. The Bradykinin B2 receptor is classified under the Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including plasma membrane, membrane, G protein-coupled receptor activity, bradykinin receptor activity, smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and vasoconstriction.
