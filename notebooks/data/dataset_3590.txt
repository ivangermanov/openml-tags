Column Description 
This dataset contains information collected by the US Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Massachusetts. It was obtained from the StatLib archive, and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms. However, these comparisons were primarily done outside of Delve and are thus somewhat suspect. The dataset is small in size. The data was originally published.
