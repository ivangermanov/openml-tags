This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-17115, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17115. It consists of twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains information about the Bradykinin B2 receptor, also known as B2 bradykinin receptor, B2R, BDKRB2, BK-2 receptor. This receptor is a single protein and belongs to the species group Oryctolagus cuniculus.

The Bradykinin B2 receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and vasoconstriction. It is located in the plasma membrane and has functions related to G protein-coupled receptor activity and bradykinin receptor activity.

The receptor is associated with various gene ontology terms, including GO:0005886 for plasma membrane, GO:0016020 for membrane, GO:0004930 for G protein-coupled receptor activity, and GO:0004947 for bradykinin receptor activity. Additionally, it is linked to UniProt accession Q28642 and InterPro accession IPR000276, IPR000496, IPR001504, and IPR017452.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, Bradykinin B2 receptor, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, vasoconstriction.
