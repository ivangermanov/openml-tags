This is the historical price data of the FOREX Australian Dollar/Swiss Franc from Dukascopy. One instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans a specific date range, excluding weekends, since the FOREX market is not active during these periods. The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following day, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is expected to increase the following day, and false when the mean High price is anticipated to decrease or remain stagnant the following day.

Please note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trade strategies should only be applied to predictions based on Close attributes, which are also available.
