**Data Description**
This is the historical price data of the Foreign Exchange Rate Euro versus Polish Zloty from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one trading day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Foreign Exchange Market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the high bid and the high ask prices of the subsequent trading day, relative to the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the current trading day. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is increasing in the following trading day, and false when the mean high price is decreasing or remains unchanged.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended for scientific research purposes only. Realistic trade strategies can only be applied to predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.**
