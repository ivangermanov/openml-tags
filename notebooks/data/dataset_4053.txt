QSAR-TID-30009 

Images, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30009. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has one hundred two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and various FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September two thousand fifteen.

It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID three thousand nine.

The dataset is useful for machine learning and image analysis applications.
