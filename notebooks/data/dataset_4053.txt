QSAR-TID-30009 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30009. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30009. The features were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints. These features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The drug target TID: 30009 is also known as Ephrin type-A receptor three. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase, and Eph family. It is found in Homo sapiens and is involved in multiple biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, cell adhesion, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

The Ephrin type-A receptor three is a protein that plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It is a transmembrane receptor that binds to ephrin ligands and activates downstream signaling pathways.
