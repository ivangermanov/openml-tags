This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Discoidin Domain Containing Receptor Two, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, and numerous other features that are difficult to read due to their technical nature.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015.

It contains information about the drug target, including its synonyms, description, and relationship to other proteins.

The drug target is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase, and it belongs to the DDR family.

It has been involved in numerous biological processes, including ossification, endochondral bone growth, protein phosphorylation, and cell adhesion.

It has also been implicated in various diseases, including spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, and has been targeted by numerous small molecules, including regorafenib.
