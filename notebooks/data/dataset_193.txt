Data from StatLib

Summary: Data from an experiment on the effects of machine adjustments on the time to count bolts. Data appear as the STATS Challenge.

A manufacturer of automotive accessories provides hardware, such as nuts, bolts, washers and screws, to fasten accessories to cars or trucks. Hardware is counted and packaged automatically. Bolts are dumped into a large metal dish with a rotating bottom plate. This rotation forces bolts to the outside of the dish and up along a narrow ledge. Due to vibration, some bolts fall back into the dish. The ledge spirals up to a point where bolts drop into a pan on a conveyor belt, passing by an electronic eye that counts them. When the preset number is reached, rotation stops and the conveyor belt moves forward.

Several adjustments affect the machine's operation:
- Speed setting controlling the rotation speed of the bottom plate
- Total number of bolts to be counted
- Second speed setting used to change rotation speed for the last few bolts
- Number of bolts to be counted at the second speed
- Sensitivity of the electronic eye

The sensitivity setting ensures the correct number of bolts are counted, balancing customer satisfaction and cost efficiency. From an engineering perspective, if the correct number of bolts is counted, sensitivity should not affect counting time.

The measured response is the time in seconds to count the desired number of bolts, normalized to the time to count twenty bolts for comparison. Data were collected for multiple combinations of settings.

The goal is to analyze which adjustments have the greatest effect on counting time, how to adjust the machine for the shortest counting time, and identify any unusual features in the data.
