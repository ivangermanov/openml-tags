Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Eight.

This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete medium model. The Barley Bayesian Network consists of forty-eight nodes connected by eighty-four arcs, with a total of one hundred fourteen thousand and five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, while the average degree is three point five, with a maximum in-degree of four.

The preliminary model for barley was developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". This model features various factors influencing barley production, including agronomic characteristics, soil properties, and environmental factors.

Some notable characteristics include total kernel volume, thousand kernel weight, protein content, and sort size, among others.
