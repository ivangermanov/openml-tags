Machine Learning and Statistics Subsampling of the dataset Numerai Twenty Eight Point Six with Seed Equals Two 

This dataset has been generated through a process of subsampling from the original Numerai Twenty Eight Point Six dataset. The subsampling was performed using a specific set of parameters, including a maximum number of rows, a maximum number of columns, and a maximum number of classes.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset until the maximum number of classes was reached. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to select the corresponding data points from the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled until the maximum number of columns was reached. This was done by selecting a specified number of column indices at random and then sorting them to ensure consistency.

Finally, the dataset was stratified according to the target variable, and a specified number of data points were randomly selected while maintaining the same distribution of classes as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of a selection of attributes, including attribute zero, attribute one, attribute two, and so on up to attribute twenty-one.
