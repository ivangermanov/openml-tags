QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, also known as NRC, Nuclear receptor subfamily group C member, PPARG, or PPAR gamma. This is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It is classified as a Transcription factor/Nuclear receptor/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily group C/Nuclear hormone receptor subfamily group C member.

The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma is involved in numerous biological processes, including regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory responses. It functions as a nuclear receptor that can bind DNA and regulate gene expression. The protein plays important roles in adipocyte differentiation, insulin sensitivity, and lipid homeostasis.

Several chemical compounds have been studied for their effects on this receptor, including tesaglitazar, muraglitazar, and saroglitazar. These compounds act as agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and have been investigated for potential therapeutic applications related to metabolic disorders.

The dataset provides molecular fingerprint features that can be used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting compound activity on this important drug target. Such models may aid in the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents targeting the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma.
