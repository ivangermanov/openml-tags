Lung Cancer Data

Title: Lung Cancer Data

Source Information:
Data was published in Pattern Recognition journal. The donor of this dataset is unknown.

Past Usage:
This dataset has been previously used in several studies, including one by Hong and Yang to illustrate the power of the optimal discriminant plane even in ill-posed settings. Additionally, Aeberhard et al. compared classification methods in high dimensional settings using this dataset.

Relevant Information:
The dataset describes three types of pathological lung cancers. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the individual variables or the origin of the data. It is worth noting that some values in the original data were missing or incorrect, which have been replaced with unknown values.

Number of Instances:
There are thirty-two instances in this dataset.

Number of Attributes:
There are fifty-seven attributes in total, including one class attribute and fifty-six predictive attributes.

Attribute Information:
The first attribute is the class label, while all other predictive attributes are nominal, taking on integer values ranging from zero to three.

Missing Attribute Values:
There are missing values in attributes five and thirty-nine, which have been replaced with unknown values.

Class Distribution:
The dataset consists of three classes, with nine observations in the first class, thirteen in the second class, and ten in the third class.

Information about the dataset:
The class type is nominal, and the class index is the first attribute. There are numerous attributes, but they are not easily readable.
