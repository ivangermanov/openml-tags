Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers. The final feature is binaryClass.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original dataset, where the target variable has been converted into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the original numeric target feature and then categorizing instances based on their relation to this mean value. Instances with target values below the mean were classified as positive, denoted by 'P', while those above the mean were classified as negative, denoted by 'N'. This binarization technique allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a continuous or multi-class problem.

The dataset likely contains various measurements or observations across multiple features, though the specific nature of these features is not explicitly stated. The binary classification outcome is represented by the binaryClass feature, which serves as the target variable for predictive modeling tasks.
