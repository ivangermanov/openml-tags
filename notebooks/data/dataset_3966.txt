QSAR-TID-10443 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Trypsin I, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Trypsin I is a single protein with preferred name Alpha-trypsin chain one and synonyms including Anionic trypsin I, Anionic trypsin-I, Beta-trypsin, and more. It belongs to the species Bos taurus and has a protein target classification of one Enzyme/Protease/Serine protease/Serine protease PA clan/Serine protease S one A subfamily.

The dataset is related to various biological processes including proteolysis and digestion, and has component relationships with extracellular region, extracellular space, and serine protease inhibitor complex. It also has function relationships with endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, and serpin family protein binding.

The dataset has been referenced in various databases including canSAR-Target, IntAct, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
