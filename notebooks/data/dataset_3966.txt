The QSAR-TID-10443 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Trypsin I. This dataset has seven hundred sixty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

Trypsin I, also known as Alpha-trypsin chain one and two, Anionic trypsin I, Anionic trypsin-I, Beta-trypsin, is an enzyme that belongs to the serine protease family. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, digestion, and blood coagulation.

Trypsin I is a single protein that is primarily found in the extracellular region and extracellular space. It plays a crucial role in many cellular processes, including the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids.

The dataset includes information about the protein structure, function, and interactions, including gene ontology terms, protein-protein interactions, and small molecule-protein interactions.
