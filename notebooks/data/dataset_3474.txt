QSAR-TID-10450 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10450. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10450. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the Human Herpes Virus Five Capsid Protein P40, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as Assemblin, Assembly Protein, Capsid Assembly Protein, and Capsid Scaffolding Protein. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, viral process, and viral release from host cell.
