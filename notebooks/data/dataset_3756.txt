QSAR-TID-102399 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102399. The dataset has eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102399. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the PAS domain-containing serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is a single protein target.

The PAS domain-containing serine/threonine-protein kinase is a protein target that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK1 family/CAMK protein kinase PASK subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, regulation of respiratory gaseous exchange, negative regulation of glycogen biosynthetic process, positive regulation of translation, protein autophosphorylation, regulation of glucagon secretion, and energy homeostasis.
