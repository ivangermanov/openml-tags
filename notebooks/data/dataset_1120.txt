The Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescope project (MAGIC) dataset was donated by the Institute of Computer Science, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The data source is the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset simulates the registration of high-energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using imaging techniques. Cherenkov gamma telescopes observe high-energy gamma rays by taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation, ranging from visible to UV wavelengths, penetrates the atmosphere and is recorded by the detector, allowing for the reconstruction of shower parameters.

The available information consists of pulses left by incoming Cherenkov photons on photomultiplier tubes arranged in a plane called the camera. Depending on the primary gamma's energy, hundreds to thousands of Cherenkov photons are collected in patterns called shower images. These patterns allow for statistical discrimination between signals caused by primary gammas and background images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere.

Typically, a shower image after preprocessing appears as an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, indicating that the telescope is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, resulting in a correlation axis and defining an ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse, often called Hillas parameters, are among the image parameters used for discrimination.

The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. Additional discriminating characteristics include the extent of the cluster in the image plane and the total sum of depositions.

The dataset was generated by a Monte Carlo program called Corsika, which simulates extensive air showers. The program was run with parameters allowing for the observation of events with energies down to below 50 GeV.

The dataset includes various continuous attributes such as the major and minor axes of the ellipse, the logarithm of the sum of content of all pixels, ratios of pixel content, distance and angle measurements, and moments along the major and minor axes. The class attribute distinguishes between gamma (signal) and hadron (background) events.

It's important to note that for technical reasons, the number of hadron events is underestimated in this dataset. In real data, the hadron class represents the majority of events. Simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, as misclassifying a background event as a signal is more problematic than the reverse. Comparison of different classifiers requires the use of an ROC curve, with relevant points corresponding to specific thresholds of accepting background events as signals.
