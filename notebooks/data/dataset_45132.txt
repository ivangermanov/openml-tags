Child Bayesian Network. Sample One.

The Child Bayesian Network is a discrete medium-sized network residing in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. This network comprises twenty nodes connected by twenty-five arcs, encompassing two hundred thirty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is three, while the average degree is two point five, with a maximum in-degree of two.

This network is particularly useful for modeling complex relationships between various factors influencing a child's health. It takes into account multiple aspects, including medical history, symptoms, test results, and demographic information, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

The Child Bayesian Network has been widely cited in research papers and is considered a seminal work in the field of machine learning and life science.

Features include age, medical history, test results, and symptoms, which are all crucial in understanding and predicting a child's health outcomes.
