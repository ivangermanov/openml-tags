**Child Bayesian Network. Sample One.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a valuable resource for this dataset.

This Child Bayesian Network consists of twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with a total of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three, and the average degree is two point five. The maximum in-degree is two.

This dataset is a representation of a probabilistic expert system, which is a type of system that deals with uncertainty and incomplete information.

The network features several variables, including Age, which is an important factor in determining the likelihood of certain outcomes. Other variables include reports from medical tests, such as Chest X-ray and CO2 Report, as well as symptoms like Grunting and Hypoxia. The network also includes variables related to the patient's medical history, such as Birth Asphyxia and Lung Parenchymal Disease.
