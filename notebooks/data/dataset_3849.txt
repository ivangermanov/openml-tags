QSAR-TID-11407 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11407. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1488 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2, also known as JNK2, JNK-55, MAPK9, and MAPK 9. It is a single protein from Homo sapiens, belonging to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase MAPK family/CMGC protein kinase JNK subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, JNK cascade, positive regulation of gene expression, and response to reactive oxygen species. It is also involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and positive regulation of podosome assembly.

The protein has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, inflammatory response, and neurodegenerative disorders.
