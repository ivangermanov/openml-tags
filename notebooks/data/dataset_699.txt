Background:

This paper develops an approach to data disclosure in survey settings by adopting a probabilistic definition of disclosure due to Dalenius. The approach is based on the principle that a data collection agency must consider disclosure from the perspective of an intruder in order to efficiently evaluate data disclosure limitation procedures. The probabilistic definition and the attempt to study optimal intruder behavior lead naturally to a Bayesian formulation. The methods are applied in a small-scale simulation study using data adapted from an actual survey conducted by the Institute for Social Research at York University.

The Data:

The case study uses data from the survey data Elite Canadian Decision-Makers collected by the Institute for Social Research at York University. This survey was conducted using telephone interviews and there were respondents, but many of these did not supply complete data. Data on variables, each of which was measured on a point scale, has been extracted:

Civil liberties:
- Free speech is just not worth it.
- We have gone too far in pushing equal rights in this country.
- It is better to live in an orderly society than to allow people so much freedom.
- Free speech ought to be allowed for all political groups.

Attitudes towards Jews:
- Most Jews do not care what happens to people who are not Jews.
- Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get ahead.

Canada-US relationship:
- Ensure independent Canada.
- Canada should have free trade with the USA.
- Canada's way of life is influenced strongly by USA.
- Canada benefits from US investments.

In addition, data on two approximately continuous variables is included:

Personal information:
- Income: Total family income before taxes (with top-coding at $).
- Age: Based on year of birth.

The original survey data was transformed to create a database of approximately continuous variables. Categorical variables were added to increase the number of levels, and new variables were defined. Cases with missing observations and involving young children were removed, resulting in a database consisting of observations.

To enhance continuity, normal distributed variates were added to age observations, uniform variates were added to incomes below $, and incomes exceeding $ were simulated using a t distribution. Normal distributed variates were added to other variables.

The agency releases information about all variables, except for Attitudes (towards Jews), which is unavailable to the intruder and is at the center of the intruder's investigation. The released data is denoted by Z, and the intruder's data, X, is assumed to be accurate and related to Z via a transformation involving bias removing parameters and normally distributed disturbances.

Data Used in the Computations:

A complete simulation of the procedures was conducted for the complete set of cases. Four different scenarios were considered for the simulation:

- The released data contains no bias or noise
- The released data contains only noise
- The released data contains only bias
- The released data contains both bias and noise

Each individual was taken in turn as the object of the intruder's efforts and calculations were carried out.

Structure of the Datasets:

Each attached dataset consists of four space-separated columns containing the data on Age, Civil, Can/US and Income ($) respectively.
