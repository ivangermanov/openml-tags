This is a sample of the original CIFAR 10 dataset, consisting of twenty thousand instances. The sample was randomly selected and stratified, with two thousand examples per class. The training and test sets are merged. To find the corresponding task for the original train-test splits, refer to the original CIFAR 10 dataset.

CIFAR 10 is a labeled subset of the eighty million tiny images dataset. It consists of thirty-two by thirty-two color images representing ten classes of objects: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The classes are completely mutually exclusive, with no overlap between automobiles and trucks. Automobile includes sedans, SUVs, and similar vehicles, while truck includes only big trucks, excluding pickup trucks.

Each instance represents a thirty-two by thirty-two color image as an array. The image is stored in row-major order, with the first thirty-two entries of the array being the red channel values of the first row of the image. The labels are encoded as integers, corresponding to the numbered classes listed above.
