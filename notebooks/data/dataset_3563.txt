QSAR-TID-100789 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100789. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase SRPK one, which is a single protein target. This protein is also known as Serine/Arginine-Rich Protein-Specific Kinase one, SFRS Protein Kinase one, SRPK one, SR-Protein-Specific Kinase one, and SRSF Protein Kinase one.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including spliceosomal complex assembly, mRNA processing, protein phosphorylation, and chromosome segregation. It is also involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing, via spliceosome, and the regulation of mRNA processing.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, chromosome, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, plasma membrane, nuclear matrix, and nuclear speck. It has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, RNA binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, and transferase activity.
