Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Male, Married, Runs per week, Age, Income, College, Distance, Treadmill, Miles per week, Type of running, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on running shoes and related factors. It has been processed to create a binary classification problem from the original numeric data. The conversion was done by calculating the mean of the target feature and categorizing instances below this threshold as positive, while those above are labeled negative. This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to the data.

The features included in the dataset cover various aspects of runners' profiles and habits. These include demographic information such as gender, marital status, age, income, and education level. Running-specific attributes are also captured, such as the frequency of runs per week, distances covered, use of treadmills, weekly mileage, and the type of running engaged in. The binary class feature serves as the target variable for classification tasks.

This dataset can be valuable for researchers and data scientists interested in analyzing factors that influence running shoe preferences or performance. It may also be useful for testing and comparing different binary classification algorithms in the context of sports-related data.
