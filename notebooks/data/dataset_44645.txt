Name: King-Rook versus King-Pawn Seed Two

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset King-Rook versus King-Pawn with seed equal to two

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes from the unique classes in the dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

The function then uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns randomly and filters the data accordingly. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly and splits it into a subset of the required size using the train test split function from scikit-learn.

The function finally returns a dataset with the filtered data, categorical mask, and column names.
