Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This dataset represents a modified version of census data, where the original numeric values have been transformed into a binary classification problem. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean were labeled as positive, while those above were labeled as negative. This binarization allows for simplified analysis and modeling of the census data in a classification context.
