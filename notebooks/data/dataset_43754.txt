The German Credit Risk dataset contains one thousand entries with twenty categorical and symbolic attributes. Each entry represents an individual who has taken a credit from a bank, and is classified as a good or bad credit risk based on a set of attributes. 

It is extremely challenging to comprehend the original dataset due to its complex system of categories and symbols. Therefore, a Python script was written to convert it into a readable CSV file. Several columns were ignored because they were deemed unimportant or had obscure descriptions. 

The selected attributes include Age, which is a numeric value, and Sex, which is a text attribute with values male and female. Job is a numeric attribute with values ranging from unskilled and non-resident to highly skilled. Housing is a text attribute with values own, rent, or free. Saving accounts is a text attribute with values little, moderate, quite rich, and rich. Checking account is a numeric attribute in Deutsch Mark. Credit amount is a numeric attribute in Deutsch Mark. Duration is a numeric attribute in months. Purpose is a text attribute with values car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, and vacation/others.
