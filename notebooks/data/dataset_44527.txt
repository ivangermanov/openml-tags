Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratified argument determines whether the sampling is stratified or not.

The function uses the pandas library to manipulate the data. It first selects a random subset of classes using the value counts of the target variable. Then, it selects a random subset of columns using the choice function from the numpy random library. Finally, it selects a random subset of rows using the train test split function from the sklearn library.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
