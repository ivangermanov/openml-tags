QSAR-TID-10547 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10547. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 622 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The C-C chemokine receptor type 1 is a single protein preferred name, also known as C-C chemokine receptor type 1, C-C CKR-1, CC-CKR-1, CCR1, and CCR-1. It is a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and chemokine receptor.

The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification. The protein target classification is one, membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and chemokine receptor.

The description relationship accession is C-C chemokine receptor type 1, single protein, P32246.
