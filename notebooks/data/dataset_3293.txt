QSAR-TID-12569 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12569. The dataset has 891 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the chemical structure of compounds.

The features in the dataset are represented by a series of FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in cheminformatics. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings, which are a notation for describing the structure of molecules using short strings of characters.

The dataset is intended for use in QSAR modeling and machine learning applications, where it can be used to train models to predict the activity of compounds against the drug target TID: 12569.
