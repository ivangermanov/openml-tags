Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on wind-related measurements and predictions, likely for meteorological or environmental studies. The data has been transformed from its original numeric format into a binary classification problem, which could be useful for machine learning applications or simplified analysis. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target feature and then categorizing values below this threshold as positive, while those above are labeled as negative.

The dataset includes various temporal and geographical features, potentially representing different locations or weather stations. These features could be used to analyze wind patterns, predict weather conditions, or study climate-related phenomena across different regions and time periods.

Features include temporal data such as year, month, and day, as well as various location-specific measurements. Some of the location codes mentioned are RPT, VAL, ROS, KIL, SHA, BIR, DUB, CLA, MUL, CLO, and BEL. The final feature, binaryClass, represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.
