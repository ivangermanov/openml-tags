QSAR-TID-10979 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10979. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and multiple FCFP6 features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically study three, focusing on agriculture and earth science.

The dataset is related to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor one, a single protein preferred name, also known as FLT, FLT one, Fms-like tyrosine kinase one, FRT, and others. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TK protein kinase group, and tyrosine protein kinase VEGFR family.

The dataset includes information on the expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, Wikipedia, canSAR-target, guide to pharmacology, int act, pharm gkb, pharos, reactome, and uniprot.

Keywords: QSAR, TID, drug target, molecular fingerprints, pipeline pilot, MetaQSAR, agriculture, earth science, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, single protein, enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TK protein kinase group, tyrosine protein kinase VEGFR family.
