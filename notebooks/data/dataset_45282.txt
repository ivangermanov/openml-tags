We introduce AfriSenti, a comprehensive dataset consisting of fourteen sentiment datasets comprising over one hundred thousand tweets in fourteen African languages, namely Amharic, Algerian Arabic, Hausa, Igbo, Kinyarwanda, Moroccan Arabic, Mozambican Portuguese, Nigerian Pidgin, Oromo, Swahili, Tigrinya, Twi, Xitsonga, and Yoruba, which belong to four distinct language families. These datasets were meticulously annotated by native speakers. The data was utilized in the groundbreaking SemEval task twelve, the first Afro-centric SemEval shared task. Our ultimate goal is for AfriSenti to facilitate innovative research on underrepresented languages.
