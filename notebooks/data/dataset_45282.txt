We introduce AfriSenti, a comprehensive dataset consisting of fourteen sentiment datasets of tweets in fourteen African languages, including Amharic, Algerian Arabic, Hausa, Igbo, Kinyarwanda, Moroccan Arabic, Mozambican Portuguese, Nigerian Pidgin, Oromo, Swahili, Tigrinya, Twi, Xitsonga, and Yoruba, which belong to four language families. These datasets have been annotated by native speakers, ensuring the accuracy and cultural relevance of the sentiment labels. The AfriSenti dataset was used in the first Afro-centric SemEval shared task, specifically in SemEval Task twelve. We hope that AfriSenti will enable new research and development on under-represented languages, promoting a more inclusive and diverse natural language processing community. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/afrisenti-semeval/afrisent-semeval.
