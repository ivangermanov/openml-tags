This dataset, One Million Reddit Comments from Forty Subreddits, is an extract from a larger Reddit dataset that contains more comments and associated information such as timestamps, authors, and flairs. For ease of use, the first twenty-five thousand comments from each of the forty most frequently visited subreddits were selected, ensuring that the volumes are balanced if the subreddit is used as categorical data. Removed comments, comments from deleted authors, and comments deemed too short (less than four tokens) were excluded, and the format was changed from JSON to CSV.

This is primarily a natural language processing dataset, but in addition to the comments, three features were added that were deemed the most important, aiming for feature type variety. The information kept includes the subreddit on which the comment was posted, the comment content, a controversiality metric score, and a score calculated by subtracting downvotes from upvotes.

Acknowledgments are due to pushshift.io, which collects this data on a monthly basis. The full information can be easily accessed if more features and data are desired.

This dataset offers a range of possibilities, including gaining interesting insights or building simple models, thanks to the variety of feature types.
