Source: Unknown - Date unknown

Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: DMFT Begin, DMFT End, Gender, Ethnic, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata DMFT, is associated with mythbusting and study-related tags. Its origin and creation date are unknown. The data has been modified from its original form, transforming a multi-class target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by designating the majority class as positive and grouping all other classes as negative. The dataset includes features related to DMFT (likely referring to Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth) measurements at the beginning and end of a period, as well as demographic information such as gender and ethnicity. The binary classification feature is also included. This modified version of the dataset is intended to facilitate certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that require binary outcomes.
