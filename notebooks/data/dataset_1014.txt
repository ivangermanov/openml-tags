The Anal Cat Data Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study 

This dataset has undergone a transformation, where the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by re-labeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

The dataset consists of various features including the beginning and end of DMFT, gender, ethnicity, and a binary class. These features provide valuable insights for analysis and research purposes.
