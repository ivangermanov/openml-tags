The QSAR-TID-17033 dataset is a collection of QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 17033. This dataset contains 270 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The protein target classification for this dataset is enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase Src family. The description relationship accession for this protein is proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including immune system process, cell cycle, cell adhesion, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, and osteoclast development. It is also involved in various cellular components, including nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and plasma membrane.

The dataset is annotated with various gene ontology terms, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, and ATP binding.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase, enzyme, kinase, cellular component, gene ontology.
