The goal of the research is to assist auditors by building a classification model that can predict fraudulent firms based on present and historical risk factors. The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as Irrigation, Public Health, Buildings and Roads, Forest, Corporate, Animal Husbandry, Communication, Electrical, Land, Science and Technology, Tourism, Fisheries, Industries, and Agriculture.

The original dataset was separated into a trial and audit dataset. In this dataset, these are concatenated into one dataset. Two features, trial and audit, have been added to indicate whether the data was originally from the trial or audit dataset.

The dataset includes various risk factors examined from different areas, such as past records of the audit office, audit paras, environmental conditions reports, firm reputation summary, on-going issues report, profit-value records, loss-value records, and follow-up reports. After in-depth interviews with auditors, important risk factors were evaluated, and their probability of existence was calculated from the present and past records.
