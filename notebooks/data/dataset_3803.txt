The QSAR-TID-103435 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103435. It has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It contains FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The features represent molecular properties and structural information of the compounds. They include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

This dataset is related to demographics, MTLQSAR, and study three. It is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive platform for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The target protein is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase MAK, also known as Male Germ Cell-Associated Kinase. It is an enzyme that belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group, RCK family. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, spermatogenesis, and cell differentiation.
