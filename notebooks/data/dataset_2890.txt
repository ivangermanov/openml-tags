This dataset, aptly named Beer Reviews, falls under the categories of Government and Politics. It comprises an extensive collection of beer reviews sourced from Beer Advocate, spanning over a decade. The comprehensive dataset encompasses all reviews up to a certain point in time. Each individual review provides ratings based on five distinct aspects: the beer's appearance, its aromatic qualities, the sensation of the beer in the mouth, its taste, and the reviewer's overall impression.

In addition to these ratings, each review includes detailed information about the product being reviewed and the individual submitting the review. Furthermore, the review itself is presented in plain text, allowing readers to gain a deeper understanding of the reviewer's thoughts and opinions. This dataset also incorporates reviews sourced from Rate Beer.

The various characteristics of this dataset include brewery information, review timing, ratings for each of the five aforementioned aspects, the reviewer's profile name, the style of beer, and details specific to the beer itself, such as its name and alcohol content.
