QSAR-TID-11269 Dataset: Machine Learning, Meteorology, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11269. It has 614 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMEBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of molecular fingerprints, which can be used for machine learning-based modeling and prediction of biological activities. The molecular fingerprints are represented as binary vectors, where each bit corresponds to a specific molecular feature or substructure.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a large collection of QSAR datasets for various biological targets and endpoints. The project focuses on the development of machine learning models for predicting biological activities and properties of small molecules.

The dataset is useful for researchers working in the field of cheminformatics, machine learning, and medicinal chemistry. It provides a valuable resource for developing predictive models and identifying potential leads for drug discovery.
