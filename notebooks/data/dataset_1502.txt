Skin Segmentation Dataset
Tags: study

The Skin Segmentation dataset is constructed over the B, G, R color space. Skin and Nonskin data is generated using skin textures from face images representing a diverse range of ages, genders, and races. The dataset is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The skin dataset is collected by randomly sampling B, G, R values from face images of various age groups (young, middle, and old), race groups (white, black, and asian), and genders obtained from the FERET database and PAL database. The total learning sample size is substantial, with a significant portion dedicated to skin samples and the remainder to non skin samples. The Color FERET Image Database and PAL Face Database from the Productive Aging Laboratory at The University of Texas at Dallas were utilized in this collection process.

This dataset has multiple dimensions, where the first three columns represent B, G, R (x, x, and x features) values, and the fourth column contains the class labels (decision variable y). The dataset provides valuable information for skin region segmentation and related studies in computer vision and image processing.

Relevant research has been conducted using this dataset, including the development of efficient skin region segmentation techniques using low complexity fuzzy decision tree models and the exploration of adaptive digital makeup applications. These studies have contributed to advancements in visual computing and image analysis.

The Skin Segmentation dataset offers a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners working on skin detection algorithms, facial recognition systems, and related applications in computer vision and image processing. Its diverse representation of skin tones across different demographics makes it particularly valuable for developing robust and inclusive algorithms.
