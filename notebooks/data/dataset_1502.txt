The Skin Segmentation Data Set 

Abstract:
The Skin Segmentation dataset is constructed over BGR color space. Skin and Non-Skin dataset is generated using skin textures from face images of diversity of age, gender, and race people.

Title: 
Skin Segmentation Data Set 

Data Set Information:
The skin dataset is collected by randomly sampling BGR values from face images of various age groups, race groups, and genders obtained from FERET database and PAL database. 

Attribute Information:
This dataset is of the dimension where first three columns are BGR values and fourth column is of the class labels.
