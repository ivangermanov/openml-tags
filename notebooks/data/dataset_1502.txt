QSAR-TID-30015 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30015. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features. 

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.
