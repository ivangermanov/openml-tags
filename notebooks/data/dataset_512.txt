Please cite: The data consist of observations taken from a balloon about thirty kilometres above the surface of the earth. In the section of the flight shown here, the balloon increases in height. As radiation increases with height, there is a non-decreasing trend in the data. The outliers are caused by the fact that the balloon slowly rotates, causing the ropes from which the measuring instrument is suspended to cut off the direct radiation from the sun. The first column contains the raw data, the second column the residuals after the removal of a non-decreasing trend.
