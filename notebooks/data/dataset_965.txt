Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

This dataset focuses on various animal characteristics and classifications. It includes features such as the presence of hair, feathers, eggs, milk production, ability to fly, aquatic nature, predatory behavior, presence of teeth, backbone, breathing mechanism, venomous nature, presence of fins, number of legs, tail, domestication status, and size relative to a cat. The dataset has been modified to create a binary classification problem, simplifying the original multi-class structure.

The Zoo dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying animal taxonomy, comparative biology, and machine learning classification techniques. It provides a comprehensive set of attributes that can be used to distinguish between different animal species and groups. Researchers and data scientists can utilize this dataset to develop and test algorithms for animal classification, explore patterns in animal characteristics, and investigate evolutionary relationships among various species.
