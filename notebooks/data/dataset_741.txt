The Census Six Dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. This means that the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean was computed and all instances with a lower target value were classified as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all other instances were classified as Negative, denoted by 'N'. The dataset comprises several features, including Column One, Column Two, Column Three, Column Four, Column Five, and Column Six, which collectively contribute to the binary classification outcome.
