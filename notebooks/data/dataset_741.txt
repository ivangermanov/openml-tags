Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on sleep-related data and has been processed to create a binary classification problem. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization process allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset includes various sleep-related measurements and parameters, which can be used to analyze and predict sleep states or related outcomes. Researchers and data scientists interested in sleep studies, pattern recognition, or binary classification problems may find this dataset particularly useful.

It is important to note that the source and original date of this dataset are unknown, which may impact its applicability in certain research contexts. Users of this dataset should be aware of this limitation and consider it when drawing conclusions or making generalizations based on the data.

Features included in this dataset are heart rate and sleep state, along with the binarized class label. These features provide a foundation for exploring relationships between physiological measurements and sleep-related outcomes in a binary classification context.
