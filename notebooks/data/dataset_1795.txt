The QSAR-TID-11873 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Ten (MAP3K10), also known as Mixed Lineage Kinase Two (MLK2). This dataset has one hundred fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI50.

The features represent Folded Chemical Functionality-Class Fingerprints (FCFP) One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September Two Thousand Fifteen.
