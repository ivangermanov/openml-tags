QSAR-TID-10058 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10058. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Melanocortin Receptor Four, which is a single protein target. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including diet-induced thermogenesis, energy reserve metabolic process, and signal transduction.

The receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in peptide hormone binding and G protein-coupled receptor activity.
