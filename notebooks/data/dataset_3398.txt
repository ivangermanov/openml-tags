The ACS Income dataset is one of five datasets created as an improved alternative to the popular UCI Adult dataset. It was compiled from data obtained from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample. The dataset provides information for all fifty states and Puerto Rico. This particular upload represents the raw data from the year two thousand eighteen.

The dataset contains a large number of records, along with ten features and one target variable. For added convenience, an additional column has been included to provide the state code. Detailed descriptions of each column can be found in the original publication, as well as in the Public Use Microdata Sample Data Dictionary.

Features include age, class of worker, educational attainment, marital status, occupation, place of birth, relationship, work hours per week, sex, race, state, and personal income.
