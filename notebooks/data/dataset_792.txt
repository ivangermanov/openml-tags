Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version 1). This dataset converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for binary classification tasks to be performed on what was originally a regression problem. The dataset provides an opportunity to explore the effects of binarization on regression data and its implications for machine learning algorithms.

The dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in studying the impact of data transformation techniques on model performance and interpretability. By comparing results obtained from the original regression dataset with those from this binarized version, insights can be gained into the trade-offs between continuous and discrete target variables in predictive modeling.
