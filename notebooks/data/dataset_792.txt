Fri C Two Dataset 

This is a binarized regression problem dataset, particularly useful for chemistry and life science studies. It is also relevant to myth-busting exercises and various study cases.

The dataset is a modified version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive (labelled 'Positive') and all others as negative (labelled 'Negative').

The dataset includes several features, including ozone-related variables.
