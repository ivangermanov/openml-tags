This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred one thousand seventy-three, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains numerous features including molecule chembl id, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four zero, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four one, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four two, and many more.

Scraped data includes information about putative uncharacterized serine threonine protein kinase sgk one hundred ten. It has synonyms such as sbk three, sgk one hundred ten, sh three binding domain kinase family member three, sugen kinase one hundred ten, and uncharacterized serine threonine protein kinase sbk three.

Organism for this target is homo sapiens. Species group is no protein target classification, and it belongs to enzyme kinase protein kinase other protein kinase group other protein kinase nkf one family.

Description relationship accession uncharacterized serine threonine protein kinase sbk three single protein p zero c two sixty-four.
