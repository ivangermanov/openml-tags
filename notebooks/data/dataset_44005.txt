Miami Housing 2016 Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark.

The dataset contains information on single-family homes sold in Miami. Besides publicly available information, the dataset includes distance variables, aviation noise as well as latitude and longitude. The dataset contains the following columns: 

* Parcel Number: a unique identifier for each property, with about one percent appearing multiple times.
* Sale Price: the sale price in dollars.
* Land Square Footage: the land area in square feet.
* Total Living Area: the floor area in square feet.
* Special Feature Value: the value of special features, such as swimming pools, in dollars.
* Rail Distance: the distance to the nearest rail line, an indicator of noise, in feet.
* Ocean Distance: the distance to the ocean in feet.
* Water Distance: the distance to the nearest body of water in feet.
* Central Business District Distance: the distance to the Miami central business district in feet.
* Subcenter Distance: the distance to the nearest subcenter in feet.
* Highway Distance: the distance to the nearest highway, an indicator of noise, in feet.
* Age: the age of the structure.
* Aviation Noise Exceedance: a dummy variable for airplane noise exceeding an acceptable level.
* Structure Quality: the quality of the structure.
* Month Sold: the sale month in the year, with January being one.

A typical model would try to predict the logarithm of the sale price as a function of all variables except the parcel number.
