This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10684. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The Complement C1s subcomponent is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including C1 Esterase, Complement C1s Subcomponent Heavy Chain, and Complement C1s Subcomponent Light Chain. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, and serine protease PA clan.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, containing QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. The features do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Complement C1s subcomponent has multiple functions, including endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. It is involved in various biological processes, such as immune system process, proteolysis, complement activation, classical pathway, and innate immune response.

Keywords: QSAR, Complement C1s, Molecular Fingerprints, Serine Protease, Immune System Process, Proteolysis.
