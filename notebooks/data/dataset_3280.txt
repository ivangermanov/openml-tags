QSAR-TID-100956 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100956. The dataset has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100956. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in G-protein coupled receptor one twenty.

G-protein coupled receptor one twenty, also known as Free Fatty Acid Receptor four, is a protein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammation. It is a promising drug target for the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as type two diabetes and obesity.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for G-protein coupled receptor one twenty, which can aid in the identification of potential drug candidates and the optimization of their activity.
