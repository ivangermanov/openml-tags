QSAR-TID-12037 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12037. The dataset has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12037. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the myosin light chain kinase two protein, which is a key enzyme involved in muscle contraction and relaxation.

The myosin light chain kinase two protein is a single protein target that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase MLCK family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, striated muscle contraction, and neuromuscular synaptic transmission.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the myosin light chain kinase two protein.
