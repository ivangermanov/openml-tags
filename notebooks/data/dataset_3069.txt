QSAR TID Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is associated with the MetaQSAR project from September. It focuses on the Neuropeptide Y receptor type, also known as NPYR, NPYY, or NPY R. This receptor is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor category, specifically the peptide receptor and short peptide receptor subcategories within the neuropeptide Y receptor classification.

The Neuropeptide Y receptor type is involved in various biological processes, including glucose metabolism, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, neuropeptide signaling, locomotory behavior, feeding behavior, blood pressure regulation, pain perception, and regulation of multicellular organism growth. Its molecular functions encompass peptide YY receptor activity, pancreatic polypeptide receptor activity, G protein coupled receptor activity, neuropeptide Y receptor activity, protein binding, and neuropeptide binding.

This receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane and neuron projections. It has been associated with several database entries, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. The receptor plays a role in multiple signaling events, including peptide ligand binding receptors and G alpha (i) signaling events.
