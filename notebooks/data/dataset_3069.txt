**QSAR-TID-10475**
Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10475, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
