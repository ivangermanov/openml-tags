This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand two hundred sixty-three, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September.

It contains information about a single protein, specifically the Dopamine D one receptor, which is also known as the D one A dopamine receptor, Dopamine D one receptor, and DRD one.

The Dopamine D one receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is classified under the monoamine receptor group. It is primarily found in the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, cilium, and synapse, among other locations.

The receptor plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and adenylate cyclase activation. It is also involved in vasodilation, positive regulation of release of sequestered calcium ion into cytosol, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration involved in phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled signaling pathway.
