Glass Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study

The Glass Dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

This conversion enables researchers to focus on the key differences between the majority class and all other classes, facilitating a more in-depth analysis of the dataset. By simplifying the target feature, researchers can apply various machine learning algorithms and statistical models to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable.

The dataset includes several features, including Refractive Index, Sodium, Magnesium, Aluminum, Silicon, Potassium, Calcium, Barium, Iron, and Binary Class.
