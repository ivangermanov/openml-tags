Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, which has been transformed from its original numeric format into a binary classification task. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target variable and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this computed average. This modification allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a continuous prediction problem. The dataset is associated with various studies and mythbusting exercises, suggesting its use in experimental or investigative research contexts. The features are labeled with the prefix "oz" followed by numbers, indicating they may represent measurements or observations, while the target variable is now a binary class.
