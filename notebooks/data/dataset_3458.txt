QSAR-TID-30020 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30020. The dataset has eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that encodes the structural information of a molecule into a binary string. The fingerprints are generated using the FCFP algorithm, which is a widely used method for generating molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is suitable for QSAR modeling and machine learning applications, and can be used to develop predictive models for the activity of compounds on the drug target TID: 30020.
