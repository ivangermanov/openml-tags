Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily human-readable and have been omitted for clarity.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been transformed into a binary classification task. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean threshold, respectively.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies and appears to be part of a larger collection of datasets used for various analytical purposes. It may be particularly useful for researchers and data scientists interested in exploring binary classification problems or comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms on transformed regression data.

While the original source and date of creation are unknown, users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately in their work. The binarization process applied to this dataset allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem, potentially offering new insights or analytical approaches.
