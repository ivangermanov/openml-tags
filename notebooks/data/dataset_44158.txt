KDDCup09 Upselling

Tags: Machine Learning, Social Media

Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "classification on categorical and numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset originates from the KDD Cup 2009, a competition that provides the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange. The goal is to predict the propensity of customers to switch providers (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (upselling).

In customer relationship management systems, building knowledge about customers relies heavily on producing scores. These scores serve as evaluations for all instances of a target variable, providing quantifiable information that can be projected onto a given population. The score is computed using input variables that describe instances, and these scores are then utilized by the information system to personalize the customer relationship.

The industrial customer analysis platform developed by Orange Labs is capable of building prediction models with a vast number of input variables. This platform implements various processing methods for instance and variable selection, prediction, and indexation based on an efficient model combined with variable selection regularization and model averaging method. Its main characteristic lies in its ability to scale on extremely large datasets with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of variables.

The rapid and robust detection of the variables that contribute most significantly to the output prediction is crucial in marketing applications. Upselling, a sales technique, aims to persuade customers to purchase more expensive items, upgrades, or other add-ons to increase profitability. Upselling often involves marketing more profitable services or products, but it can also entail exposing customers to other options they may not have considered previously.

The training set comprises numerous examples, with the first predictive variables being numerical and the remaining predictive variables being categorical. The target variable is binary.

Features: various numerical and categorical variables.
