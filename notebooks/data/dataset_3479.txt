QSAR-TID-100424 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TXK, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TXK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TXK is a single protein, also known as Protein-Tyrosine Kinase Four, Resting Lymphocyte Kinase, or RLK. It belongs to the Tec family kinase protein family and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including adaptive immune response, immune system process, protein phosphorylation, and regulation of gene expression.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.
