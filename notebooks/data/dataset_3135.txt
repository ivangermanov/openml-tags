QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Serine/threonine protein kinase Nek, also known as KIAA, NEK, Never in mitosis A related kinase, NimA related protein kinase, and Renal carcinoma antigen NY REN. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/Other protein kinase group/Other protein kinase NEK family classification.

The protein is associated with various cellular components including the pericentriolar material, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, centrosome, microtubule organizing center, cytosol, cytoskeleton, and centriolar satellite. Its functions involve nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, metal ion binding, and protein binding.

The protein is involved in several biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, cell cycle regulation, phosphorylation, cell projection organization, cell division, and cilium assembly. It is associated with conditions like Short rib polydactyly syndrome, type II.

The dataset and associated protein information can be found in various databases including ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, GoProcess, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, CGD, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
