QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and numerous FCFP fingerprint bits.

The dataset pertains to Cathepsin B, a single protein target also known as BCSB, Cathepsin B heavy chain, Cathepsin B light chain, and CTSB. It is found in Bos taurus and classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Cysteine protease/Cysteine protease CA clan/Cysteine protease C family.

Gene Ontology annotations indicate Cathepsin B is involved in various cellular components including the extracellular region, lysosome, plasma membrane, and melanosome. Its molecular functions encompass endopeptidase activity, cysteine type peptidase activity, and collagen binding. Biological processes it participates in include proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, collagen catabolism, and viral entry into host cells.

The target is associated with several database entries including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It plays roles in pathways such as collagen degradation, MHC class II antigen presentation, and neutrophil degranulation according to Reactome annotations.
