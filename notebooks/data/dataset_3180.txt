The Porto Seguro dataset is a training dataset from the Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction Kaggle challenge. The primary objective of this challenge is to predict whether a driver will file an insurance claim in the following year. According to the official rules of the challenge, the data can be utilized for academic research and education, as well as other non-commercial purposes.

For a comprehensive understanding of all variables, it is recommended to refer to the Kaggle dataset repository. Notably, numeric features with integer values that do not contain "binary" or "categorical" in their variable names are, in fact, ordinal features, which could be treated as ordinal factors in programming languages like R.

To gain insight into effective preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, it is suggested to explore the Kernels section of the Kaggle challenge website. Many participants in the challenge chose to remove all calculation variables, as they appear to lack significant information.

The dataset comprises various features, including the target variable, individual-related features, registration-related features, car-related features, and calculation-related features. These features encompass a range of variables, from individual characteristics to vehicle attributes.
