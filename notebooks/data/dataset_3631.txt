QSAR-TID-12719 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12719. It has fifty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.
