Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are indicators of the network's complexity.

The Alarm Monitoring System is a case study that demonstrates the application of probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks.

The network features a range of variables, including patient history, physiological parameters, and medical equipment settings. These variables are interconnected, allowing for the modeling of complex relationships between them.

The Alarm Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with Bayesian networks and probabilistic inference.

Keywords: Bayesian network, probabilistic inference, medical diagnosis, patient monitoring, complex systems.
