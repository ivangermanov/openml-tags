Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. 

First, it samples the classes uniformly. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it samples the columns uniformly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the columns randomly and filters the data accordingly.

Finally, if the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows. It concatenates the data and target, splits the data into a subset, and then separates the data and target again.

The function returns a dataset with the sampled data, target, categorical mask, and columns.
