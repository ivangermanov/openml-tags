Primary Breast Cancer vs Normal Breast Tissue

Context: Tumor microRNA expression profiling identifies circulating microRNAs for earlier breast cancer detection. Due to microRNA's role in tumorigenesis and remarkable stability in body fluids, microRNAs are emerging as a promising diagnostic tool.

The aim of this study was to identify tumor microRNA signatures for the discrimination of breast cancer and the intrinsic molecular subtypes, and to study in plasma the status of the most significant ones in order to identify potential circulating biomarkers for breast cancer detection.

Content: The columns are each microRNA name and the rows are the samples. The values are microarray expression data.
