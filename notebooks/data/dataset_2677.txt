This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex aud sgd currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day, without including weekends since Forex markets are closed during this period. The entire dataset spans a specific timeframe and does not account for weekends.

The timezone of the feature Timestamp is set to Europe Amsterdam. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following day, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. This means the class attribute is true when the mean High price is increasing the following day, and false when the mean High price is decreasing or remains stagnant the following day.

Please note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trade strategies should only be applied to predictions based on Close attributes, which are also available.
