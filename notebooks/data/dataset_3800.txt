QSAR-TID-104261 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane A2 Receptor, and it has thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and nine hundred twenty-six more...

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The Thromboxane A2 Receptor is a single protein target, also known as Prostanoid TP Receptor, Tbxa2r, and TXA2-R. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, inflammatory response, and signal transduction.

The receptor is expressed in the Mus musculus species and is classified as a lipid-like ligand receptor. It has been shown to be involved in various biological processes, including response to nutrient, response to xenobiotic stimulus, and regulation of vasoconstriction.
