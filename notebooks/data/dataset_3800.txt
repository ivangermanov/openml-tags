QSAR-TID-104261 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane A2 Receptor, and it has thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including identifiers and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecular identifiers and molecular fingerprints.

MetaQSAR Project 

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

Demographics
