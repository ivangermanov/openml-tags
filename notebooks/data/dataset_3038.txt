The BME dataset is tagged under Machine Learning and Meteorology. This dataset features various attributes including Exciting Force, which represents the force exerted on an object, Peak of the Glottal Flow, which measures the maximum flow rate of air through the glottis, and Excitation Moment, which captures the instant when the excitation begins. Additionally, the dataset includes Peak Moment, which records the highest point of a particular moment, Closed Quotient, which calculates the ratio of closed phase to the total duration, and Total Energy Discrete and Total Energy ESD, which quantify the overall energy levels.

Furthermore, the dataset comprises statistical measurements such as Mean, which provides an average value, Variance, which indicates the spread of data, Skewness, which describes the asymmetry of data distribution, and Kurtosis, which measures the tailedness of data distribution. The classes in this dataset are also included, providing categorizations for the data.
