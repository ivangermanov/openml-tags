QSAR-TID-279 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 279, and it has a certain number of rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project.

The dataset shows activity values of several compounds on the serotonin one f receptor, also known as five hydroxytryptamine receptor one f. The serotonin one f receptor is a single protein that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is involved in various physiological processes including signal transduction, neurotransmission, and regulation of adenylate cyclase activity.

The serotonin one f receptor is a potential drug target for the treatment of certain neurological disorders. Several compounds have been identified as agonists of this receptor, including almotriptan, lasmiditan, and eletriptan. These compounds have been shown to be effective in the treatment of migraine and other conditions.
