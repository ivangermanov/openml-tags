Higgs Tags: This is a classification problem to distinguish between a signal process that produces Higgs bosons and a background process that does not.

The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. These features include properties of leptons, jets, and missing energy. The last seven features are functions of the first twenty-one features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features.

Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and neural networks are presented in the original paper. The last portion of the examples is used as a test set.

The first column is the class label, where one represents signal and zero represents background, followed by the twenty-eight features. These features include properties of leptons, jets, and missing energy, as well as high-level features derived from these properties.

The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations to distinguish between signal and background processes. The features are a combination of kinematic properties and high-level features derived from these properties. The goal is to use deep learning methods to improve the classification of signal and background processes.
