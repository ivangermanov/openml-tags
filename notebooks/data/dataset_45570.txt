Higgs 
Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

This is a classification problem to distinguish between a signal process that produces Higgs Bosons and a background process that does not produce them.

The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. These features include the momentum and direction of particles such as leptons and jets, as well as the amount of missing energy in the detector. The last seven features are functions of the first twenty-one features and are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to automate the development of such features, rather than relying on manual development by physicists.

Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and multi-layer neural networks are presented in the original research. A large portion of the data is reserved for testing the performance of different machine learning models.

Attribute Information 
The first column is the class label, where one indicates a signal process and zero indicates a background process. The remaining columns represent the twenty-eight features, consisting of twenty-one low-level features and seven high-level features. 

Additional Information 
The data does not contain any missing values. The dataset is suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models designed to classify signal and background processes.
