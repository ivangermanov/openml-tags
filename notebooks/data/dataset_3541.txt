QSAR-TID-20007 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mixed Lineage Kinase 7, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mixed Lineage Kinase 7. Mixed Lineage Kinase 7 is a single protein, also known as Human Cervical Cancer Suppressor Gene 4 Protein, Leucine Zipper- and Sterile Alpha Motif-Containing Kinase, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Twenty. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TKL protein kinase group, TKL protein kinase MLK family, and TKL protein kinase MLK subfamily.

The dataset has multiple features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Mixed Lineage Kinase 7 is involved in various biological processes, including DNA damage checkpoint signaling, MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle, chromosome segregation, JNK cascade, cell death, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, regulation of mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition, cell differentiation, stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, intracellular signal transduction, p38MAPK cascade, embryonic digit morphogenesis, positive regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of programmed cell death, protein autophosphorylation, stress-activated MAPK cascade, limb development, pyroptosis, negative regulation of stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, cellular response to gamma radiation, cellular response to UV-B, GCN2-mediated signaling, and negative regulation of translation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.
