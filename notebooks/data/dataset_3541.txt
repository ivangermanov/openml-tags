QSAR-TID-20007 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mixed Lineage Kinase Seven, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI50. 

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, numerous molecular fingerprint features, and Median Pseudo-pCI50.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mixed Lineage Kinase Seven.

Mixed Lineage Kinase Seven is also known as Human Cervical Cancer Suppressor Gene Four Protein, Leucine Zipper-and Sterile Alpha Motif-containing Kinase, Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Twenty, among others.

It is an enzyme, a kinase, and a protein kinase belonging to the TKL protein kinase group and TKL protein kinase MLK family. It is involved in numerous biological processes including DNA damage checkpoint signaling, MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, cell death, and others.
