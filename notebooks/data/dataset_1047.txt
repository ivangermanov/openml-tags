Title: USP05: Software effort estimation at project, feature and requirement levels

This data set was split into USP05-RQ and USP05-FT for requirements and features respectively. USP05-RQ and USP05-FT were used for software effort estimation by analogy in the referenced studies. The data set was collected from university student projects. A detailed description of the whole data set can be found in the referenced literature.

The data set contains 203 instances (6 projects, 121 requirements, 76 features) and 17 attributes including ID, Object Type, and Effort (which is the actual effort). Attributes include functionality percentage, internal complexity, number of data files accessed, number of data entry and output items, unadjusted function point count, programming language used, development tools and platforms, language and tool experience level, applications experience level, team size, database systems, methodology, and application type.

The data features various object types (project, feature, requirement), effort measurements, functional and complexity metrics, as well as information about the development environment and team characteristics. This comprehensive set of attributes allows for in-depth analysis of software effort estimation across different levels of software development.
