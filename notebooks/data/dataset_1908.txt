QSAR-TID-14070 Dataset

Tags: Demographics, Geography, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14070. It has thirty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-six FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.
