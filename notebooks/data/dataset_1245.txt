The Adult dataset is a collection of data extracted from the 1994 Census database. The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over fifty thousand dollars per year.

Extraction was done using certain conditions: the person's age must be greater than sixteen, their adjusted gross income must be more than one hundred, their final weight must be more than one, and they must have worked more than zero hours per week. 

Variables are mostly self-explanatory except for Final Weight, which is a proxy for the demographic background of individuals. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. However, this similarity statement is not applicable across the fifty-one different states.

Description from the donor of the database explains that the weights on the Current Population Survey files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. These estimates are prepared monthly and use three sets of controls: a single cell estimate of the population sixteen plus for each state; controls for Hispanic origin by age and sex; and controls by race, age, and sex. 

Features include Age, Work Class, Final Weight, Education, Education Number, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship, Race, Sex, Capital Gain, Capital Loss, Hours Per Week, Native Country, and Class.
