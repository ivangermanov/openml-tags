Lung Cancer Shedden Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

This dataset is based on a multi-site blinded validation study on gene expression-based survival prediction in lung adenocarcinoma. The study aimed to develop a molecular assay to predict survival in resected non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer patients.

The dataset contains several features, including overall survival years, overall survival event, histology, age, sex, and various gene expressions. These gene expressions were normalized using the fRMA method and only include the so-called "Kratz genes".

This research is part of the Director's Challenge Consortium for the Molecular Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma and has been published in Nature Medicine. An international validation study was also conducted and published in The Lancet.
