This dataset contains fRMA-normalized gene expression data focused on "Kratz-genes" as described in the study "A practical molecular assay to predict survival in resected non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer: development and international validation studies" published in The Lancet.

The dataset includes various features related to patient characteristics and gene expression profiles. These features encompass overall survival in years, overall survival event status, histology, age, sex, and multiple gene expression measurements. The gene expression data is represented by probe set identifiers corresponding to specific genes of interest in lung cancer research.

This comprehensive dataset aims to facilitate the study of gene expression patterns and their relationship to survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma patients. It provides a valuable resource for researchers investigating molecular markers and potential prognostic factors in non-small-cell lung cancer.
