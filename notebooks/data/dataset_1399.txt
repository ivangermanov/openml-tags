QSAR-TID-11755 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FYN, also known as Proto-Oncogene c-Fyn or Src-Like Kinase. 

The dataset consists of one thousand eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase FYN is a single protein preferred name that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group and tyrosine protein kinase src family. 

It is a proto-oncogene that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.
