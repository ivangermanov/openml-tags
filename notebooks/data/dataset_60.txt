Waveform Database Generator

Tags: artificial, OpenML, study, uci

This dataset is a generator that produces three classes of waves. Each class is generated from a combination of two out of three "base" waves. The dataset contains forty attributes describing the waveform, all of which include noise. The latter nineteen attributes are all noise attributes with mean zero and variance one.

The dataset is sourced from UCI and is part of multiple studies. It is an artificial dataset used for classification tasks. There is an earlier version of this dataset that only has twenty-one attributes, as it does not include the nineteen noise features.

Attribute Information:
The dataset consists of forty attributes describing the waveform, all of which include noise. The latter nineteen attributes are purely noise attributes with mean zero and variance one. The features describe various aspects of the waveform.

Each class in the dataset is generated from a combination of two out of three "base" waves. Instances are generated with added noise (mean zero, variance one) in each attribute. For more detailed information, readers are directed to the referenced book.

The dataset contains five thousand instances and does not have any missing values. It is commonly used in machine learning research and benchmarking studies.
