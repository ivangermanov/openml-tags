The Waveform Database Generator is a machine learning dataset that generates three classes of waves. Each class is created from a unique combination of two out of three base waves. This dataset provides forty attributes that describe the waveform, all of which include noise.

The latter nineteen attributes are specifically designed to be noise attributes with a mean of zero and a variance of one. This allows researchers to test the robustness of their models against noisy data.

For a detailed explanation of how the dataset was generated, please refer to the relevant sections of the book "Classification and Regression Trees". The dataset itself consists of five thousand instances, and there are no missing values.

Each instance in the dataset is generated by adding noise with a mean of zero and a variance of one to each attribute. This allows researchers to simulate real-world scenarios where data is often noisy and unreliable.
