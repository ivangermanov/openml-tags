The MNIST database of handwritten digits contains features, with raw data available online. It can be split into a training set of examples and a test set of examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. This database is ideal for those wanting to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while minimizing efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

The original black and white images from NIST were size-normalized to fit in a pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels due to the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. The images were centered in a larger image by computing the center of mass of the pixels and translating the image to position this point at the center of the field.

With certain classification methods, particularly template-based methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors, the error rate improves when the digits are centered by bounding box rather than center of mass. If this kind of pre-processing is performed, it should be reported in publications.

The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's datasets. NIST originally designated one set as their training set and another as their test set. However, one set is much cleaner and easier to recognize than the other. This is because one set was collected among Census Bureau employees, while the other was collected among high school students.

To draw sensible conclusions from learning experiments, it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets. The MNIST training set is composed of patterns from both sets. The test set was also composed of patterns from both sets. The pattern training set contained examples from approximately writers. Care was taken to ensure that the sets of writers of the training set and test set were disjoint.

One of NIST's sets contains digit images written by different writers. In contrast to the other set, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in this set is scrambled. Writer identities for this set are available and were used to unscramble the writers. This set was then split in two: characters written by the first group of writers went into the new training set, while the remaining writers were placed in the test set.

The new training set was completed with examples from the other set to make a full set of training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with examples from the other set to make a full set of test patterns. Only a subset of test images is available on the website, while the full sample training set is available.
