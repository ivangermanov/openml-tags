Context 
This dataset was used to classify tweets about our company. We took tweets and manually classified them as positive, negative, or neutral.

Content 
The dataset consists of four columns: 
The Tweet ID, which is unique; 
the actual Tweet Text; 
the Tweet Language, which is always English since all tweets are in English; 
and the Tweet Sentiment Value, where zero represents negative, one represents neutral, and two represents positive.

Acknowledgments
