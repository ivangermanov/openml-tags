This directory contains the Thyroid dataset, which includes ann-train.data containing learning examples and ann-test.data containing testing examples. The dataset was obtained from Daimler-Benz.

The dataset summary provides an overview of the twenty-one attributes, fifteen of which are binary and six are continuous, as well as the three classes into which the data is categorized. There are a total of learning examples and testing examples available.

The problem posed by this dataset is determining whether a patient referred to the clinic is hypothyroid. To accomplish this, three classes were created: normal (not hypothyroid), hyperfunction, and subnormal functioning. Due to the fact that ninety-two percent of patients are not hypothyroid, a good classifier must perform significantly better than ninety-two percent.

This dataset differs from the one Ross Quinlan placed in pub/machine-learning-databases/thyroid-disease on ics.uci.edu. However, it has been used in two technical reports.

One report, titled "Optimization of the Backpropagation Algorithm for Training Multilayer Perceptrons," provides an overview of multiple backpropagation speedup techniques. Fifteen different algorithms are described in detail and compared using a large, challenging dataset. The report discusses learning speed and network classification performance with respect to both the training dataset and the testing dataset.

Another report, titled "Synthesis and Performance Analysis of Multilayer Neural Network Architectures," presents various approaches for automatically optimizing the topology of backpropagation networks. It reviews the basics of genetic algorithms, surveys backpropagation, and discusses topological properties of feedforward networks. The report also presents pioneering work in the field of topology optimization.

The dataset has been used in machine learning research, particularly in the development of artificial neural networks. Its difficulty in training backpropagation artificial neural networks has made it a valuable resource for researchers.
