This directory contains the Thyroid dataset. The "ann-train.data" file contains learning examples, and the "ann-test.data" file contains testing examples. This data was obtained from Daimler-Benz.

The dataset summary is as follows: the dataset has twenty-one attributes, fifteen of which are binary and six of which are continuous. There are three classes, and the dataset is available in an ASCII file.

The problem is to determine whether a patient referred to the clinic is hypothyroid. Therefore, three classes are built: normal (not hypothyroid), hyperfunction, and subnormal functioning. Because the majority of patients are not hyperthyroid, a good classifier must be significantly better than average.

This dataset was used in a case study by Ross Quinlan in his article "Simplifying Decision Trees" (International Journal of Man-Machine Studies). Unfortunately, this data differs from the one Ross Quinlan placed in "pub/machine-learning-databases/thyroid-disease" on "ics.uci.edu".

The dataset is used in two technical reports: "Optimization of the Backpropagation Algorithm for Training Multilayer Perceptrons" and "Synthesis and Performance Analysis of Multilayer Neural Network Architectures". The first report is an overview of many different backprop speedup techniques, describing fifteen algorithms in detail and comparing them using a practical dataset. The report discusses learning speed and network classification performance with respect to the training dataset and a testing dataset.

The second report presents various approaches for automatic topology optimization of backpropagation networks, reviewing the basics of genetic algorithms and the topological properties of feedforward networks. The report applies a genetic algorithm to a medical classification problem, comparing the performance with respect to the training set and a test set of pattern samples to fixed network topologies.
