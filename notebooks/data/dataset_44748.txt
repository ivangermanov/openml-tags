Subsampling of the dataset Guillermo with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and stratify equal to True.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratify argument determines whether the subsample should be stratified according to the target variable.

The dataset is subsampled to have a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratify argument is set to True, which means that the subsample will be stratified according to the target variable.

The resulting dataset has the following features:
