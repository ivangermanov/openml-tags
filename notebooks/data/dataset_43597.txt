The One Hundred Fifty Thousand Lyrics Labeled with Spotify Valence Tags dataset is a comprehensive collection of lyrics, carefully curated to facilitate supervised natural language processing sentiment analysis tasks. This dataset leverages the Spotify valence audio feature, a nuanced measure of the positiveness of a song, to provide a rich context for analysis.

The preparation of this dataset is thoroughly explained in a dedicated notebook, which outlines the meticulous process of compiling and labeling the lyrics. This dataset builds upon the foundation laid by the Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Lyrics dataset, a remarkable resource that has been instrumental in this project.

The primary inspiration behind this dataset is the analysis of lyrics in relation to other song audio features, with a focus on exploring the intricate relationships between these elements.

The dataset comprises several key features, including the artist, sequence, song, and label.

Keywords: lyrics, sentiment analysis, Spotify valence, natural language processing, audio features.
