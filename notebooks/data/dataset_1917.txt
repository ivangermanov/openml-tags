The QSAR-TID-11188 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11188. This dataset has thirty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The compounds in this dataset have activity values measured in pseudo-pCI fifty units. These compounds were tested on the drug target Cytochrome P four fifty one, which is a single protein preferred name. This enzyme is also known by synonyms such as CYP five one, CYP five one A one, CYPLI, Cytochrome P four fifty fourteen DM, and Cytochrome P four fifty minus fourteen DM.

Cytochrome P four fifty one is an enzyme that belongs to the cytochrome P four fifty family and is involved in various biological processes such as lipid metabolic process, steroid biosynthetic process, cholesterol biosynthetic process, and others. It is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and has monooxygenase activity, iron ion binding, and other functions.
