This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103437. The dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103437. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase, which is a single protein target.

The STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and ion transport. It is involved in the regulation of blood pressure, inflammatory response, and cell chemotaxis, among other processes.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase.
