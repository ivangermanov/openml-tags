The Alarm Bayesian Network is a case study in probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. It is a discrete medium-sized network consisting of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with five hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, and the average degree is roughly two point four nine. The maximum in-degree is four.

This network was used to model the Alarm Monitoring System, which is designed to monitor patients in intensive care units. The system takes into account various factors such as patient history, physiological data, and medical interventions to predict potential alarms and provide warnings to medical staff.

The network features several variables related to patient physiology, medical interventions, and potential complications. These include variables related to ventilation, blood pressure, cardiac function, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters.
