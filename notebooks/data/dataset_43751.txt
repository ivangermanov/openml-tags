Context Space Apps Moscow

The International Space Apps Challenge was held on a weekend in April, and we would like to extend our gratitude to all the participants who joined us at this location. 

The dataset provided for this challenge contains a variety of columns, including wind direction, wind speed, humidity, and temperature. The response parameter that we are trying to predict is the level of solar radiation. This dataset contains measurements for the past few months, and the goal is to predict the level of solar radiation in the future. Imagine that you have solar energy batteries and you want to know if it will be reasonable to use them in the future.

Acknowledgements

We would like to thank NASA for providing the dataset.

Inspiration

The task is to predict the level of solar radiation. After analyzing the dataset, we have found some interesting dependencies, such as the relationship between humidity and solar radiation, as well as the relationship between temperature and solar radiation. The best result of accuracy we could achieve using cross-validation was moderate.

The dataset features include time-related data, radiation measurements, temperature, pressure, humidity, wind direction, speed, and sunrise and sunset times.
