Context Space Apps Moscow was an event that took place recently, bringing together individuals interested in space-related challenges.

The dataset provided for this challenge contains various columns, including wind direction, wind speed, humidity, and temperature. The primary goal is to predict the solar radiation levels based on these parameters.

Imagine owning solar energy batteries and wanting to determine whether they would be effective in generating power in the future. This is precisely what this challenge aims to achieve, predicting the level of solar radiation.

There are several intersecting dependencies that have been identified, including the relationship between humidity and solar radiation, as well as temperature and solar radiation.

Using cross-validation, the highest accuracy achieved so far has been moderate, around fifty-five percent.

The dataset features include time-related data, radiation levels, temperature, pressure, humidity, wind direction, speed, sunrise time, and sunset time.
