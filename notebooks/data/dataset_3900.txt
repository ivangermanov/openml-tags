The Goodreads Computer Books dataset was created to fulfill the need for a comprehensive and clean collection of computer books. During my search for relevant datasets on Kaggle, I realized that most existing datasets lacked essential columns or contained unclean data. It became clear that relying solely on text reviews is insufficient to determine a book's quality.

To address this issue, I collected data from the "Computer" category on the Goodreads website to provide a valuable resource for individuals interested in computer books, regardless of language and publication details.

The inspiration behind creating this dataset is straightforward â€“ to provide a list of computer books for everyone to explore and discover new titles. Feel free to utilize this dataset to identify your next great read, and I encourage you to experiment with different approaches to analyzing the data.

This project began on January eighteenth, two thousand twenty-one, and I plan to update the dataset regularly.

Please note that any missing values have been imputed by the creator. The dataset includes the following features: Book Title, Ratings Count, Average Rating, Publication Year, Edition, Number of Pages, Language, and Reviews.
