Dataset: a9a

Tags: LIBSVM, Adult dataset, Binary classification

This dataset originates from the LIBSVM data repository and is based on the Adult dataset. The original Adult dataset contains fourteen features, including six continuous and eight categorical variables. In this version, the continuous features have been discretized into quantiles, with each quantile represented by a binary feature. Additionally, categorical features with multiple categories have been converted into separate binary features for each category.

The preprocessing details for each feature can be found at the beginning of the relevant files on the provided webpage. The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks and has been widely cited in machine learning research.

The features in this dataset are numerous and have been anonymized, represented as attributes ranging from att_1 to att_124. Due to the preprocessing steps, the total number of features has expanded significantly from the original fourteen.

This dataset is part of a collection used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of adult income prediction. Researchers and practitioners interested in binary classification problems often utilize this dataset for testing and comparing different models and approaches.

For those wishing to use this dataset, it is important to cite the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source. The dataset's popularity in the machine learning community stems from its balanced mix of continuous and categorical features, making it a valuable resource for various classification techniques.
