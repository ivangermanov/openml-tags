QSAR-TID-11414 Dataset: MetaQSAR Project 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11414, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.
