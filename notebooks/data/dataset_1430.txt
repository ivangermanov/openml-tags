**Adult Dataset**

This dataset is part of the LIBSVM data repository and deals with Chemistry and Life Science.

The original Adult data set consists of fourteen features, among which six are continuous and eight are categorical. To preprocess the data, continuous features are discretized into quantiles, and each quantile is represented by a binary feature. Additionally, a categorical feature with multiple categories is converted to multiple binary features.

Details on how each feature is converted can be found in the beginning of each file from the research page.

The dataset includes various features, including demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
