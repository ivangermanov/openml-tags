**Buzz in Social Media - Twitter Tags**

This dataset contains examples of buzz events from two different social networks: Twitter, and Tom's Hardware, a forum network focusing on new technology with more conservative dynamics.

The dataset is a collection of online social network activity predictions, which can be used to analyze and understand the behavior of users in online communities.

The data was donated by BestofMedia and was created by researchers from the Universit√© Joseph Fourier (Grenoble I) and the Laboratoire d'informatique de Grenoble (LIG), as well as the BestofMedia Group.

The dataset is described in the paper "Predictions of Activity in Online Social Networks" published in the proceedings of the Conference on Models and Analysis of Networks: Mathematical and Computer Science Approaches (MARAMI) in 2013.

The dataset contains a variety of features, including metrics related to network centrality, activity levels, and user behavior.
