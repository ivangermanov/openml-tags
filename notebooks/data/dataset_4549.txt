**Buzz in Social Media - Twitter Tags**

This dataset contains examples of buzz events from two different social networks: Twitter, and Tom's Hardware, a forum network focusing on new technology with more conservative dynamics.

The dataset was created by researchers from the University of Joseph Fourier (Grenoble I) and the Laboratoire d'informatique de Grenoble (LIG), in collaboration with the BestofMedia Group.

The dataset is designed to predict activity in online social networks, and includes examples from both Twitter and Tom's Hardware. The data is sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI).

When using this dataset, please cite the following paper: Predictions of Activity in Online Social Networks, which was presented at the Conference on Models and Analysis of Networks: Mathematical and Computer Science Approaches (MARAMI) in 2013.

The dataset includes a range of attributes, including measures of node centrality, assortative mixing, and community structure.

Keywords: social media, Twitter, online social networks, buzz events, predictive modeling, node centrality, assortative mixing, community structure.
