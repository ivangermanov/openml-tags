Machine learning dataset credit-g, which has been subjected to subsampling, with a specific set of parameters used during the process. The subsampling operation involved setting a fixed seed value, which ensured reproducibility, and limiting the number of rows and columns to certain maximum values.

The dataset originally had a larger number of classes, but this was reduced to a more manageable number through a process of uniform sampling, with the probability of selection being weighted according to the frequency of each class. Similarly, the columns were also uniformly sampled, with the goal of retaining a representative subset.

Stratification played an important role in the subsampling process, particularly when selecting the desired number of rows. This involved splitting the data into subsets based on the target variable, and then applying a uniform sampling strategy within each subset. The resulting dataset consisted of a carefully chosen subset of the original data, with the categorical variables converted to string format to facilitate further analysis.

Features included in the dataset are checking status, duration, credit history, purpose, credit amount, savings status, employment, installment commitment, personal status, other parties, residence since, property magnitude, age, other payment plans, housing, existing credits, job, number of dependents, own telephone, foreign worker, and class.
