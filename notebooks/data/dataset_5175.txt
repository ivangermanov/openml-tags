Hotpot QA Distractor Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

The Hotpot QA Distractor Dataset is a novel collection of question-answer pairs based on Wikipedia articles, boasting four distinct characteristics. Firstly, the questions posed within this dataset necessitate the discovery and logical analysis of multiple supporting documents to arrive at an accurate response. Secondly, the questions themselves are remarkably diverse, unrestricted by any predetermined knowledge bases or schemas. Thirdly, the dataset provides sentence-level supporting facts essential for reasoning, thereby enabling Question Answering systems to operate under strong supervision and furnish explanations for their predictions. Lastly, it introduces a novel category of factoid comparison questions, designed to assess the capability of Question Answering systems to extract pertinent facts and execute requisite comparisons.

The dataset is sourced from the Hugging Face platform and represents the distractor subset.
