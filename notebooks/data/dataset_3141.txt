QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values of compounds on drug target TID. The activity unit is pseudo pCI. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC values. Features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is a single protein known as Matriptase, also called Membrane type serine protease, MT SP, Prostamin, or PRSS. It is found in Homo sapiens and classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Serine protease in the PA clan, S1A subfamily. The protein is associated with several Gene Ontology terms related to extracellular space, plasma membrane, peptidase activity, and various biological processes including neural tube closure, proteolysis, and keratinocyte differentiation.

Matriptase has multiple database entries and identifiers across various bioinformatics resources, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is involved in protein interactions and pathways such as the formation of the cornified envelope. The protein contains several domains including SEA, CUB, Trypsin, and LDL receptor-like domains.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains valuable information for quantitative structure-activity relationship studies in drug discovery and development. It provides molecular fingerprints and activity data that can be used to build predictive models for compound-target interactions.
