QSAR-TID-17081 Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17081. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule Chembl ID and numerous molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.
