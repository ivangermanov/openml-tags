QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Endothelin receptor ET-B, also known as EDNRB, Endothelin receptor non-selective type, Endothelin receptor type B, ET-B, and ET-BR. This receptor is found in Sus scrofa (pig) and belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor group, specifically the peptide receptor subgroup and short peptide receptor subtype within the endothelin receptor classification.

The Endothelin receptor ET-B is involved in numerous biological processes, including regulation of transcription, neural crest cell migration, renin secretion, heart rate regulation, pH regulation, signal transduction, blood circulation, blood pressure regulation, melanocyte differentiation, and enteric nervous system development. It plays roles in vasoconstriction, pigmentation, macrophage chemotaxis, and various other physiological functions.

This receptor is associated with multiple cellular components, including the plasma membrane. Its molecular functions encompass G protein-coupled receptor activity, endothelin receptor activity, and peptide hormone binding. The receptor is involved in various signaling pathways, such as G protein-coupled receptor signaling, I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, and calcium-mediated signaling.

The dataset provides valuable information for studying the Endothelin receptor ET-B and its interactions with different compounds, which can be useful for drug discovery and understanding receptor-ligand interactions in the context of various physiological processes.
