Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: columns, under, over, binaryClass

This dataset, known as fl2000, is associated with mythbusting and study tags. It represents a binarized version of an original dataset, where the multi-class target feature has been transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This transformation was achieved by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all other classes as negative ('N'). The conversion was initially performed by a researcher whose name has been omitted for privacy reasons. The dataset includes various features, some of which are human-readable such as columns, under, over, and binaryClass. The source and date of the original dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper citation and documentation in data science research.
