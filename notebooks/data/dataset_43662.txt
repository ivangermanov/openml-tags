Context: I have just created a web scraper for Stack Overflow and generated a dataset. I hope this dataset will be useful for your task.

Content: The dataset contains one CSV file, which includes the following columns: 

The number of votes for each question, 
The number of answers for each question, 
The title of each question, 
The URL link to each question, 
The tags associated with each question.

Acknowledgments: I would like to express my gratitude to the great platform Stack Overflow, which inspired me to create this dataset.

Inspiration: What is your idea for utilizing this dataset?

Features: The dataset includes the question answer count, question tags, question title, question title link, and question vote count.
