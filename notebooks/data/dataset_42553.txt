BitcoinHeist Ransomware Dataset

The BitcoinHeist dataset is a comprehensive collection of Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to December 2018. We extracted daily transactions on the network and formed the Bitcoin graph, filtering out network edges that transfer less than a certain threshold, as ransom amounts are rarely below this threshold. Ransomware addresses were taken from three widely adopted studies.

On the heterogeneous Bitcoin network, we extracted six features for each address in each twenty-four-hour snapshot: income, neighbors, weight, length, count, and loop. These features are designed to quantify specific transaction patterns, such as coin splitting, merging, and mixing rounds.

The loop feature counts how many transactions split their coins, move them through different paths, and finally merge them in a single address. The weight feature quantifies the merge behavior, where coins in multiple addresses are passed through a succession of merging transactions and accumulated in a final address. The count feature represents information on the number of transactions, whereas the weight feature represents information on the amount of transactions. The length feature quantifies mixing rounds on Bitcoin, where transactions receive and distribute similar amounts of coins in multiple rounds with newly created addresses to hide the coin origin.

We observed that ransomware addresses exhibit more profound right skewness in distributions of feature values compared to non-ransomware addresses. White Bitcoin addresses are capped at a certain limit per day, although we are certain about ransomware labels, we do not know if all white addresses are in fact not related to ransomware.
