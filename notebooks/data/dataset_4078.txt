This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ErbB-4, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bits.

QSAR data is from ChEMBL version seventeen.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

Receptor Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ErbB-4 is also known as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. It belongs to the protein kinase group and tyrosine protein kinase family.

It is involved in various biological processes including neural crest cell migration, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway.

It is also involved in the development of nervous system, heart, and lactation.
