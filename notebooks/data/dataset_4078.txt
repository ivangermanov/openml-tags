QSAR-TID-12699 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ErbB-4, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ErbB-4. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ErbB-4 is a single protein that is also known as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, HER4, and ERBB4 intracellular domain. It is a receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening. The project is a collaborative effort to collect, curate, and share QSAR data and models for various drug targets.
