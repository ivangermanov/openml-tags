The MiniBooNE dataset is utilized in the tabular data benchmark, which has been transformed in a similar manner. This dataset falls under the classification on numerical features benchmark category. 

Originally, this dataset was derived from the MiniBooNE experiment, with the primary objective of distinguishing between electron neutrinos, classified as signals, and muon neutrinos, categorized as backgrounds. The dataset follows a specific ordering pattern, where all signal observations precede the background observations.

This dataset is particularly useful for machine learning and medicine applications, as it provides a unique opportunity to develop and test algorithms capable of accurately classifying these distinct types of neutrinos.

Features included in this dataset encompass various particle identification parameters, which are essential for differentiating between electron and muon neutrinos.
