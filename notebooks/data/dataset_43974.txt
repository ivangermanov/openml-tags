MiniBooNE Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

The MiniBooNE dataset is taken from the MiniBooNE experiment and is used to distinguish electron neutrinos, which are the signal, from muon neutrinos, which are the background. This dataset is ordered, with all signal observations first, followed by background observations.

The dataset is used for classification purposes, where the goal is to identify whether a given observation is a signal or a background. The dataset contains a large number of features, which are used to describe the properties of the particles being observed.

The original dataset was described in a research paper, which presented a new approach to classification using boosted decision trees. This approach was shown to be an alternative to artificial neural networks.

Keywords: neutrino detection, particle classification, numerical features, boosted decision trees, classification benchmark.
