This dataset is part of the GEMLeR collection, which provides gene expression datasets for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in bioinformatics. These datasets can be used to evaluate various quality metrics such as accuracy, precision, and area under the ROC curve for classification, feature selection, and clustering algorithms. The repository was created to address the growing need in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized set of microarray classification problems, enabling researchers to compare different techniques on a common set of datasets.

The gene expression samples in the GEMLeR repository originate from the publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository, maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The expO project aims to collect tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on clinically annotated, deidentified tumor samples. This data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without intellectual property restrictions, benefiting patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on several factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of a uniform microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the large number of samples available for various tumor types.

When publishing research based on GEMLeR datasets, it is important to acknowledge the use of this repository to help others replicate experiments and obtain the same datasets. Researchers are also encouraged to acknowledge the contribution of the Expression Project for Oncology and the International Genomics Consortium for making their gene expression samples publicly available.

The dataset includes numerous features related to gene expression, represented by various probe set identifiers. These features correspond to different genes and genetic markers that may be relevant to breast and colon cancer studies.
