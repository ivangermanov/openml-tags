QSAR-TID-20174 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20174. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20174. The activity values are represented in unit pseudo-pCI fifty.

The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the G protein-coupled receptor forty-four, also known as CD two ninety-four, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th two cells, CRTH two, DL one R, and prostaglandin D two receptor two.

The G protein-coupled receptor forty-four is a single protein and its preferred name is prostaglandin D two receptor two. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens.

The protein target classification is one point zero, membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, and prostanoid receptor.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, prostaglandin D two receptor.
