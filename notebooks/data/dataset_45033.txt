Abalone Dataset

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. It is used in the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same way.

Original Description:

The Abalone dataset is a collection of physical measurements of abalone, a type of marine snail, used to predict their age. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope, a time-consuming and laborious task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location, may be required to solve the problem.

The dataset consists of 4177 instances, each described by eight attributes: Sex, Length, Diameter, Height, Whole Weight, Shucked Weight, Viscera Weight, and Shell Weight. The number of rings is the value to predict, either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

The attributes are:

* Sex: nominal, with values Male, Female, and Infant
* Length: continuous, measured in millimeters, representing the longest shell measurement
* Diameter: continuous, measured in millimeters, representing the diameter perpendicular to length
* Height: continuous, measured in millimeters, representing the height with meat in shell
* Whole Weight: continuous, measured in grams, representing the whole abalone
* Shucked Weight: continuous, measured in grams, representing the weight of meat
* Viscera Weight: continuous, measured in grams, representing the gut weight after bleeding
* Shell Weight: continuous, measured in grams, representing the weight of the shell after being dried

The dataset has no missing values.
