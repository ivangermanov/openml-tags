The KDD Cup Nine Up Selling dataset has been subjected to subsampling. This process involved uniformly sampling classes from the unique values present in the target variable. The number of classes sampled was capped at ten. A random sample of one hundred columns was also taken from the dataset. Furthermore, the number of rows was limited to two thousand.

The sampling strategy employed was stratified, meaning that the class distribution was preserved during the sampling process. This ensured that the resulting subsampled dataset retained the same class balance as the original dataset.

The subsampled dataset consists of various features, including Var Six, Thirteen, Twenty One, Twenty Two, and so on. These features were selected randomly from the original dataset.
