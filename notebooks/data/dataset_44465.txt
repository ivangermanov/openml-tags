Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Upselling

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is used to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows and columns, and the maximum number of classes. The function first selects a subset of classes using a stratified sampling approach, ensuring that the resulting dataset has a balanced distribution of classes. It then selects a random subset of columns and rows from the original dataset.

The function uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility. It first selects the unique classes present in the dataset and then chooses a subset of these classes based on their frequency. The indices of the rows corresponding to these classes are then selected, and the dataset is reduced to only include these rows.

If the number of columns in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function randomly selects a subset of columns. The columns are selected based on their index, and the resulting dataset only includes these columns.

Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses a stratified sampling approach to select a subset of rows. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a balanced distribution of classes.
