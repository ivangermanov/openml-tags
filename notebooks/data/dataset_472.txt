Lupus Dataset 

The Lupus dataset consists of eighty-seven individuals diagnosed with lupus nephritis who were followed up for more than fifteen years. The dataset includes thirty-five recorded deaths during this period. A key variable in this study is the duration of the disease, which was found to have a significant impact on the results. In addition to this variable, over forty other baseline variables are available upon request.

This dataset was created to investigate the relationship between the duration of untreated disease prior to biopsy and the subsequent outcome. The duration of disease clearly violates the proportionality of hazards assumption, making it a valuable case study. 

The dataset includes four main features: Time, Status, Duration, and Logarithm of one plus Duration. These features provide valuable insights into the progression of the disease and its effects on patients. 

This dataset can be freely used for non-commercial purposes and distributed without restrictions.
