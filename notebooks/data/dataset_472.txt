Please cite: A group of persons with lupus nephritis were followed up for more than fifteen years. Several deaths occurred during the study period. The primary variable of interest was the duration of disease. Over forty baseline variables are available from the study authors.

Description: This dataset arises from a group of individuals with lupus nephritis who were followed for more than fifteen years after an initial renal biopsy, which marked the starting point of follow-up. For a detailed description, refer to the introduction of a specific article published in a December issue. The dataset contains information on time to death or censoring, indicator, duration of untreated disease prior to biopsy, and the logarithm of one plus duration. The duration variable was the focus of the aforementioned article because it clearly violates the proportionality of hazards assumption. More than forty other variables acquired at baseline are available from the study authors.
