Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Adults

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset is designed to facilitate the development of efficient and accessible autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening methods for adults. ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by significant healthcare costs, which can be reduced through early diagnosis. However, current diagnostic procedures are lengthy and costly, highlighting the need for innovative solutions.

The increasing prevalence of ASD globally necessitates the creation of comprehensive datasets focused on behavioral traits. Currently, there is a scarcity of autism-related datasets, particularly those centered around clinical or screening aspects. Most existing datasets are genetic in nature, limiting their applicability in developing accurate ASD screening tools.

To address this gap, we propose a novel dataset consisting of twenty features aimed at identifying influential autistic traits and enhancing the classification of ASD cases. This dataset combines ten behavioral features derived from the AQ-10-Adult questionnaire with ten individual characteristic features proven effective in distinguishing ASD cases from controls in behavioral science research.
