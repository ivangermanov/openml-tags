Chocolate Bar Ratings

Tags: Context

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world, with a rich history and a wide range of flavors and textures. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat a staggering amount of chocolate. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal, and the quality of chocolate can vary greatly depending on factors such as the type of cocoa beans used, the percentage of cocoa, and the region in which the beans were grown.

This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used, and where the beans were grown. The ratings are based on a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation, and each chocolate is evaluated on its own merits.

The Flavors of Cacao rating system is used to evaluate the chocolate bars, with ratings ranging from one to five. A rating of five indicates an elite chocolate that transcends beyond the ordinary limits, while a rating of one indicates an unpleasant chocolate that is mostly unpalatable. The ratings are based on a combination of factors, including the flavor, texture, and aftermelt of the chocolate.

Flavor is the most important component of the Flavors of Cacao ratings, and it is evaluated based on diversity, balance, intensity, and purity. The ratings also take into account the texture of the chocolate, which can have a great impact on the overall experience. The aftermelt, or the experience after the chocolate has melted, is also an important factor in the ratings.

The overall opinion of the chocolate is also taken into account, and it reflects a subjective opinion on whether or not the components of the chocolate work together to create a cohesive and enjoyable experience.

The dataset is narrowly focused on plain dark chocolate, with the aim of appreciating the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status.

The dataset contains information on the company that produced the chocolate, the specific bean origin or bar name, the review date, the cocoa percentage, the company location, the rating, the bean type, and the broad bean origin.
