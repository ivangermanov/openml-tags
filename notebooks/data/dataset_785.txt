Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: latitude, longitude, station

This dataset focuses on wind correlations and has been binarized from its original form. The process involved converting a numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently classifying instances. Those with a target value lower than the mean were designated as positive ('P'), while all others were classified as negative ('N').

The dataset includes various features, primarily geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and multiple station measurements. These stations likely represent different locations where wind data was collected. The binarization process allows for simplified analysis and classification tasks related to wind patterns and correlations.

This transformed dataset may be particularly useful for mythbusting studies and various analytical purposes where binary classification is preferred over continuous numeric values. Researchers and data scientists interested in wind patterns, meteorological studies, or geographical data analysis might find this dataset valuable for their work.
