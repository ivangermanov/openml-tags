Wind Correlations Dataset

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes features such as Latitude and Longitude, as well as various Station identifiers.

Binary Class is the target feature in this dataset.
