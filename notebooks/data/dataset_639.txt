The Friedman datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from a specific source. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number".

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation. Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function encompasses a range of complex relationships, including sine and square functions.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output, allowing researchers to test the impact of irrelevant variables on their models. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of collinearity. Collinearity refers to the number of features that depend on other features, which can affect the accuracy of models.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters encompass various settings. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. The number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand. Additionally, the datasets are generated with different collinearity degrees, ranging from zero to four. For the datasets with a high collinearity degree, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees. Each dataset has a specific target variable, which is the last attribute in each file.
