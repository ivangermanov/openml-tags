The Meta Album DIBaS Dataset Extended is a collection of digital images of thirty-three bacterial species with approximately twenty images per species. Since the original images were large with limited samples in each class, they were split into smaller images and resized to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels, resulting in a preprocessed dataset of four thousand sixty images with at least one hundred eight images per class.

This dataset was also preprocessed using blob normalization techniques, an uncommon method for this type of image, aimed at reducing the significance of color in decision-making for a bias-aware challenge.
