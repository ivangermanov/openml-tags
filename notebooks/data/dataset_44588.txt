Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses random number generation to select a specified number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The function ensures that the subsample is stratified according to the target variable, meaning that the proportion of each class in the subsample is the same as in the original dataset.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset, using a weighted random choice to ensure that the classes are selected in proportion to their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices of the rows that correspond to these classes and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

Next, the function selects a specified number of columns from the subsampled dataset, using a uniform random choice to select the columns. It then subsets the dataset to include only these columns.

Finally, the function selects a specified number of rows from the subsampled dataset, using stratified sampling to ensure that the proportion of each class in the subsample is the same as in the original dataset.
