Mexico COVID-19 Clinical Data

This dataset contains the results of real-time PCR testing for COVID-19 in Mexico as reported by the General Directorate of Epidemiology. The official, raw dataset is available on the Official Secretary of Epidemiology website. You might also want to download the official column descriptors and the variable definitions in the following zip file.

I have maintained the original levels as described in the official dataset, unless otherwise specified. This dataset has been maintained since the original data releases, which weren't tabular, but rather consisted of PDF files, often with many/different inconsistencies which had to be resolved carefully.

I hope that this data serves as a base to understand the clinical symptoms that characterize a COVID-19 positive case from another viral respiratory disease and help expand the knowledge about COVID-19 worldwide. With more models tested, added features and fine-tuning, clinical data could be used to predict a patient with pending COVID-19 results will get a positive or negative result in two scenarios: As lab results are processed, this leaves a window when it's uncertain whether a result will return positive or negative. More importantly, it could help predict for similar symptoms, for example, from a survey or an app that checks for similar data.

The value of the lab result comes from a RT-PCR, and is stored in the Result column, where the original data is encoded as Positive and Negative.

The data was gathered using a "sentinel model" that samples ten of the patients that present a viral respiratory diagnosis to test for COVID-19, and consists of data reported by four hundred seventy-five viral respiratory disease monitoring units (hospitals) named USMER throughout the country in the entire health sector.

The data is first processed with a script. The file containing the processed data will be updated daily. Important: Since the data is updated to Github, assume the data uploaded here isn't the latest version, and instead, load data directly from the csv file in this github repository. The data aggregates official daily reports of patients admitted in COVID-19 designated units. New cases are usually concatenated at the end of the file, but each individual case also contains a unique official identifier as well as a new unique reference to remove duplicates.

I fixed a specific change in methodology in reporting, where the patient record used to be assigned in the region of the medical unit but now uses the region of residence of the patient.

Note: I have preserved the original structure (column names and factors) as closely as possible to the official data, so that code is reproducible in cross-reference to the official sources.

In addition to original features reported, I've included missing regional names and also a field which corresponds to the lag in the processing lab results.

According to the Ministry of Health, preliminary data is subject to validation by through the General Directorate of Epidemiology. Also note that the information contained corresponds only to the data obtained from the epidemiological study of a suspected case of viral respiratory disease at the time it is identified in the medical units of the Health Sector.
