Federal Reserve Interest Rates 1954-Present
Tags: Context

The Federal Reserve sets interest rates to promote conditions that achieve the mandate set by the Congress, which includes high employment, low and stable inflation, sustainable economic growth, and moderate long-term interest rates. Interest rates set by the Fed directly influence the cost of borrowing money, and lower interest rates encourage more people to obtain a mortgage for a new home or to borrow money for an automobile or for home improvement. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth as people are more likely to invest in new projects and ventures. On the other hand, lower rates also encourage businesses to borrow funds to invest in expansion, such as purchasing new equipment, updating plants, or hiring more workers, which can lead to increased productivity and job creation. Conversely, higher interest rates restrain such borrowing by consumers and businesses, which can slow down economic growth and lead to higher unemployment.

This dataset includes data on the economic conditions in the United States on a monthly basis since 1954. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds, which are balances held at Federal Reserve Banks, with each other overnight. The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks, and the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate. The effective federal funds rate is determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target. The Federal Open Market Committee meets regularly to determine the federal funds target rate, which transitioned to a target range with an upper and lower limit in December 2008.

The real gross domestic product is calculated as the seasonally adjusted quarterly rate of change in the gross domestic product based on chained dollars. The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed as a seasonally adjusted percentage of the labor force. The inflation rate reflects the monthly change in the Consumer Price Index of products excluding food and energy.
