Federal Reserve Interest Rates 1954 Present
Tags: Machine Learning, Transportation Context

The Federal Reserve sets interest rates to promote conditions that achieve the mandate set by Congress, specifically high employment, low and stable inflation, sustainable economic growth, and moderate long-term interest rates. These interest rates set by the Fed have a direct influence on the cost of borrowing money. When interest rates are lower, it encourages more individuals to obtain a mortgage for a new home or to borrow money for an automobile or for home improvement projects. Additionally, lower rates encourage businesses to borrow funds to invest in expansion, such as purchasing new equipment, updating their facilities, or hiring more workers. Conversely, higher interest rates tend to restrain this type of borrowing by both consumers and businesses.

This comprehensive dataset includes detailed information on the economic conditions in the United States on a monthly basis dating back to 1954. A key component of this dataset is the federal funds rate, which refers to the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds, specifically balances held at Federal Reserve Banks, with each other overnight. The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is ultimately determined between the two banks, and the weighted average rate for all of these types of transactions is referred to as the effective federal funds rate. It is worth noting that the effective federal funds rate is determined by the market forces, but is heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve through its open market operations aimed at reaching the federal funds rate target.

The Federal Open Market Committee meets regularly, typically eight times per year, to deliberate and determine the federal funds target rate. Historically, the target rate transitioned to a target range with both an upper and lower limit in December 2008. Furthermore, this dataset also includes information on the real gross domestic product, which is calculated as the seasonally adjusted quarterly rate of change in the gross domestic product based on chained dollars. Another important metric included in this dataset is the unemployment rate, which represents the number of unemployed individuals as a seasonally adjusted percentage of the total labor force. Lastly, the inflation rate is also tracked, reflecting the monthly change in the Consumer Price Index of various products excluding both food and energy.

The interest rate data was sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' economic data portal. The real gross domestic product data was provided by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, while the unemployment and consumer price index data were sourced from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This dataset raises several thought-provoking questions, including how economic growth, unemployment, and inflation impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Moreover, it invites exploration into how the interest rate policy has evolved over time. It also poses the intriguing question of whether one can accurately predict the Federal Reserve's next decision regarding interest rates.
