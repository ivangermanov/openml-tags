Subsampling of the dataset Jannis with seed equal to four, maximum number of rows two thousand, maximum number of columns one hundred, maximum number of classes ten, and stratify set to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters such as seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to stratify or not, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample classes, columns, and rows uniformly. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects the required number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects the required number of columns randomly. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the required number of rows. Finally, it returns a dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
