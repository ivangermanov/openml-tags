The Energy Building dataset is a multivariate regression dataset concerned with predicting the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings, which is crucial for energy efficiency. This dataset aims to investigate how various building parameters influence the energy consumption of buildings. Eight essential building characteristics are considered, including glazing area, roof area, and overall height, among others.

Features: Glazing Area, Roof Area, Overall Height 

Keywords: Energy Efficiency, Building Parameters, Heating Load, Cooling Load, Multivariate Regression, Energy Consumption.
