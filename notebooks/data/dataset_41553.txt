The Energy Building dataset is a multivariate regression data set that concerns the prediction of the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings, which is a crucial aspect of energy efficiency, as a function of various building parameters. These parameters include the glazing area, roof area, and overall height, amongst others. 

Features: Relative Compactness, Glazing Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, Overall Height, Orientation, Glazing Distribution, and Window Area.

Keywords: Energy Efficiency, Building Parameters, Heating Load, Cooling Load, Multivariate Regression.
