The QSAR-TID-100951 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100951. This dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen. It shows activity values of several compounds on the drug target non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TNK one, which is also known as CD thirty-eight negative kinase one. This enzyme is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, and protein autophosphorylation.

The non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TNK one is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TK protein kinase group, and tyrosine protein kinase. It is expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of cells and has nucleotide binding, protein kinase, protein tyrosine kinase, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase, and transferase activities.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, protein autophosphorylation.
