MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-101552 

Tags: Health, Medicine, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101552. It has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
