The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number". 

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation. Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: the output equals ten times the sine of pi times the product of the first two inputs plus twenty times the square of the third input minus point five squared plus ten times the fourth input plus five times the fifth input plus the normalized noise.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: 
the number of features ranges from small to large, 
the number of samples ranges from small to large, 
and the colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with high colinearity degree, the numbers of features are generated accordingly. The other datasets have varying numbers of features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
