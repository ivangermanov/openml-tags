The Airlines Dataset is inspired by the regression dataset. The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure. This dataset was created by downsampling the original data to a smaller size. The feature Flight was correctly encoded as a factor variable. 

The dataset includes features such as the Airline, the specific Flight, the Airport From which the flight departs, the Airport To which the flight arrives, the Day of the Week, the Time of departure, the Length of the flight, and whether there was a Delay.
