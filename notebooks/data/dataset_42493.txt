The Airlines dataset is tagged with Machine Learning and Statistics. This dataset originated from the Data Expo competition. 

The goal of this dataset is to predict whether a particular flight will be delayed based on its scheduled departure information. To achieve this, the dataset has been downscaled to a manageable size.

The dataset consists of several informative features, including the airline, airport of origin, airport of destination, day of the week, time of departure, and length of the flight. 

Please cite the Airlines dataset inspired by the regression dataset.
