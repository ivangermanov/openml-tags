**Meta Album Textures A Lot Extended**

The Textures A Lot dataset, consisting of twenty-seven thousand five hundred images from two hundred fifty categories, captures images in a controlled environment with varying viewing angles, illumination angles, and illumination colors for each material texture. A preprocessed version of Textures A Lot is used in the Meta Album meta-dataset, where images are cropped into squares and resized to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels with an anti-aliasing filter.

abstract = {For the modeling of materials, the mapping of image features onto a codebook of feature representatives receives extensive treatment. For reason of their generality and simplicity, filter bank outputs are commonly used as features. The MR Eight filter bank of Varma and Zisserman is performing well in a recent evaluation. In this paper, we construct color invariant filter sets from the original MR Eight filter bank. We evaluate several color invariant alternatives over more than two hundred fifty real-world materials recorded under a variety of imaging conditions including clutter. Our contribution is a material recognition framework that learns automatically for each material specifically the most discriminative filter bank combination and corresponding degree of color invariance. For a large set of materials each with different physical properties, we demonstrate the material-specific filter bank models to be preferred over models with fixed filter banks.}
