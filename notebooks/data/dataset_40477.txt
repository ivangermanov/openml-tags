This directory contains six databases, a corresponding test set, and corresponding documentation related to thyroid disease. The databases were contributed by the Garavan Institute of Sydney, Australia.

The documentation files provide information about each database, including its source, number and names of attributes, types of values that each attribute takes, and class names. Although brief, these descriptions should suffice to characterize the databases.

In general, these databases share certain characteristics. They have many attributes, mostly numeric or boolean valued, and relate to thyroid disease domains. Several attribute values are missing, signified by a question mark. There are a small number of classes, and each database has a large number of instances, with separate test sets containing fewer instances.

Two additional databases, hypothyroid and sick euthyroid, are also included, although their integrity is questionable due to potential corruption. They have a similar format to the other databases but lack corresponding test files and contain several missing values.

A more recent addition is a large database of thyroid diagnoses obtained from the Garavan Institute, consisting of thousands of records. A domain theory related to thyroid disease has also been added.

Another thyroid database, donated by a separate contributor, contains three classes, hundreds of instances, and five attributes, with no missing values. This database is suitable for training artificial neural networks and includes cost data.
