This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand ninety-one, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, six one thousand twenty-four zero, six one thousand twenty-four one, six one thousand twenty-four two, six one thousand twenty-four three, six one thousand twenty-four four, six one thousand twenty-four five, six one thousand twenty-four six, six one thousand twenty-four seven, six one thousand twenty-four eight, six one thousand twenty-four nine, and many more.
