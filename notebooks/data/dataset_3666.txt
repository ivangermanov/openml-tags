QSAR-TID-10971 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10971. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the drug target Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Four, which is a single protein target. The target is also known as CaM Kinase Four, Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type Four, CAMK, CAMK Four, CAMK-GR, and CaM Kinase-GR.

The target is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and is involved in various biological processes, including adaptive immune response, immune system process, and protein phosphorylation. It is also involved in the regulation of T cell differentiation in thymus, myeloid dendritic cell differentiation, and osteoclast differentiation.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Four target.
