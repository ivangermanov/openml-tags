QSAR-TID-12268 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12268. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12268. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, and contains information about the drug target, such as its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The dataset also contains information about the expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, and other relevant data.

The drug target is Dipeptidyl Peptidase II, which is a single protein with multiple synonyms, including Dipeptidyl Aminopeptidase II, Dipeptidyl Peptidase 2, and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 7. It belongs to the enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease SC clan/serine protease S28 family.
