The dataset contains fifteen classes of hand movement types in Libras, each with twenty-four instances. Each class references a specific hand movement type in Libras. 

In the video pre-processing, a time normalization is carried out by selecting frames from each video, according to a uniform distribution. In each frame, the centroid pixels of the segmented objects, which are the hands, are found, composing the discrete version of the curve. All curves are normalized in the unitary space. 

To prepare these movements for analysis by algorithms, a mapping operation is carried out, where each curve is mapped into a representation with ninety features, representing the coordinates of movement. 

Some sub-datasets are offered to support comparisons of results. 

The dataset does not have missing values. 

The dataset contains ninety numeric features and one feature for the class, which is an integer.
