Subsampling of the dataset Vehicle with seed equals Four 

Generated with the following source code 

The function subsample takes in five parameters: self, seed, number rows max, number columns max, number classes max, and stratified. It returns a dataset. The function uses numpy's default random generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. 

If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, it selects the top classes based on their frequency. It then selects the rows corresponding to these classes. 

If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, it uniformly samples the columns. 

Finally, if the total number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it performs stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows.
