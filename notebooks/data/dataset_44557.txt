Name: Vehicle Subsample with Four Random Seed and Two Thousand Rows

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Vehicle with seed equal to four, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset by uniformly selecting classes and columns, and then stratifying the sample according to the target variable. The function takes in a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample.

The function first selects a subset of classes by uniformly sampling from the unique classes in the target variable. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, and subsets the data again. Finally, it stratifies the sample according to the target variable using train test split, and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
