Amazon Employee Access is a dataset that consists of real historical data collected over a period of time. The data is used to train an algorithm that can predict whether an employee will be granted or denied access to certain resources within the company. The dataset contains information about the actions taken on employee access requests, the resources that were requested, and the managers who made the decisions. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the employees themselves, such as their role, department, title, and family description.

The goal of the Amazon Employee Access competition is to create an algorithm that can learn from this historical data and accurately predict whether an employee will be granted or denied access to a resource in the future. This requires analyzing the patterns and relationships between the different features in the dataset and identifying the most important factors that influence the access decisions.

The dataset includes a range of features that can be used to train the algorithm, including the action taken on the access request, the resource that was requested, and the manager who made the decision. The employee-related features provide additional context and can help the algorithm to better understand the access requests and make more accurate predictions.
