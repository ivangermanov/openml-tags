The Meta Album Plant Net Dataset (Micro) is a subset of the Pl@nt Net Three Hundred Thousand dataset, which is itself a sampling of the Pl@nt Net Project's repository. This dataset consists of images and labels contributed by citizen botanists from around the world, verified through a weighted reliability score from other users, ensuring that each image has been reviewed by an average of two point zero three citizen botanists.

The Meta Album Plant Net Dataset (Micro) retains twenty-five of the most populous classes from the original Pl@nt Net Three Hundred Thousand dataset, belonging to twenty-one genera, for a total of one hundred twenty thousand six hundred eighty-eight images, with a minimum of two thousand nine hundred fourteen and a maximum of nine thousand eleven images distributed per class. Each image contains a colored one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixel representation of a plant or part of a plant from the corresponding class, scaled from its initial variable width using the Inter Area anti-aliasing filter from Open CV. Almost all images were initially square; cropping by taking the largest possible square with the center at the middle of the initial image was applied otherwise.
