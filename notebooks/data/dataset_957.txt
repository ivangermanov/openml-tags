GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets specifically designed for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets enable researchers to estimate various quality metrics, including accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from the growing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems. By utilizing these datasets, multiple classification or feature selection techniques can be compared and evaluated on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly accessible Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository managed by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to collect tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analysis on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The resulting tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions. This open-access approach directly benefits patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Several factors contributed to the decision to utilize data from the expO repository, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the uniformity of microarray platforms employed across all samples, the availability of supplementary information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the large number of samples accessible for diverse tumor types.

When publishing materials based on GEMLeR datasets, users are kindly requested to acknowledge the assistance they received from utilizing this repository. This will facilitate the replication of experiments by others and promote further research.
