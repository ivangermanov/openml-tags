Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

This dataset focuses on tourism in Brazil and has been modified from its original form. The conversion process involved changing the target feature from multiple classes to a binary classification, where the majority class is labeled as positive and all other classes as negative. This binarization allows for simplified analysis and modeling of tourism patterns in Brazil. The features included in the dataset cover various aspects that may influence tourism, such as demographic information, travel expenses, infrastructure accessibility, and activity preferences. The logged income feature suggests a transformation to address potential skewness in the income distribution. Researchers studying Brazilian tourism trends or developing predictive models for tourism behavior may find this dataset particularly useful.
