Bleichenbacher Timing Attack 

This dataset contains information about the Bleichenbacher Timing Attack, which is a type of attack used to compromise the security of encrypted data. The attack takes advantage of the time delay between the server's response to different types of encrypted messages.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset includes attributes related to three different types of messages: Change Cipher Spec, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect. Each message has several attributes associated with it, including source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, and timestamp.

The Change Cipher Spec message is used to change the encryption parameters during a secure communication session. The attributes associated with this message include source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, timestamp, and order.

The TLS Alert message is used to signal an error during a secure communication session. The attributes associated with this message include source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, timestamp, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and order.

The TCP Disconnect message is used to terminate a connection during a secure communication session. The attributes associated with this message include source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, timestamp, and order.
