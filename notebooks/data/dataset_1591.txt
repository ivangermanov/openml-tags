Please cite: Dataset from the LIBSVM data repository.

Preprocessing: Binary encoding was utilized for each feature (o, b, x), resulting in a total of one hundred twenty-six features.

Features: The dataset includes numerous attributes, labeled as "att" followed by a number. These attributes represent various aspects of the Connect Four game state. Due to the large number of features, they are not individually listed here.

This dataset pertains to the classic game of Connect Four, where players attempt to align four of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal. The data has been preprocessed to create a binary encoding of the game board state, allowing for machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict game outcomes or optimal moves.

The original source of this dataset is the LIBSVM data repository, which is a widely used resource in the machine learning community. LIBSVM is particularly known for its implementation of support vector machines, though this dataset can be used with various machine learning techniques.

Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation of the LIBSVM repository as the original source. The binary encoding preprocessing step has transformed the original game board representation into a format more suitable for machine learning applications, expanding the number of features to account for all possible states of each position on the board.
