QSAR-TID-101598 Dataset

Tags: Astronomy, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one zero one five nine eight, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It has numerous features including molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule, and the median pXC fifty is a measure of the molecule's activity.

The molecular fingerprints are represented as binary vectors, where each bit corresponds to the presence or absence of a particular substructure in the molecule.

This dataset can be used for various machine learning and cheminformatics applications, including virtual screening, lead optimization, and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling.
