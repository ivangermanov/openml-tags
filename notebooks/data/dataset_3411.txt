Superconduct Dataset

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics

The Superconduct dataset contains information on a large collection of superconductors. The dataset consists of eighty-one columns containing extracted features and one column containing the critical temperature, which serves as the target variable.

The original data from which these features were extracted is publicly available at http://supercon.nims.go.jp/index_en.html.

Studies related to this dataset have been published, including an article titled "Machine Learning Prediction of Critical Temperature of Superconductors" that explores the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the critical temperature of superconductors based on their chemical composition.

This dataset was sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository.

To use this dataset, please cite the UCI Machine Learning Repository according to their citation policy.

Features include various physical properties of the elements comprising each superconductor, such as atomic mass, atomic radius, density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence.
