QSAR-TID-100859 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100859. The dataset has twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100859. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Free Fatty Acid Receptor one, which is a single protein target.

The Free Fatty Acid Receptor one is a G-protein coupled receptor that is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis. It is also known as GPR forty or FFAR one.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for the Free Fatty Acid Receptor one, as well as for those who are interested in understanding the relationship between the structure of compounds and their activity on this target.
