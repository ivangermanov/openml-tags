This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10373. It has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It is essential to cite this dataset when used.

The dataset contains information about the Prostate Specific Antigen, a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as APS, Gamma-seminoprotein, Kallikrein-3, KLK3, and P-30 antigen. The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification. The description relationship accession is Prostate-specific antigen single protein P07288.

The dataset also provides information about the expression atlas, component, function, process, and Wikipedia entries related to the Prostate Specific Antigen. Additionally, it includes information from canSAR-target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, and UniProt databases.
