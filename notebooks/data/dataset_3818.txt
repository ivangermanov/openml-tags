QSAR-TID-17049 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17049. The dataset has fifty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Progesterone Receptor, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Three Group C Member Three, PGR, and Progesterone Receptor. The Progesterone Receptor is a single protein, and it is a transcription factor, nuclear receptor, and nuclear hormone receptor subfamily three group C member three.

The Progesterone Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including ovulation from ovarian follicle, epithelial cell maturation, glandular epithelial cell maturation, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, negative regulation of gene expression, mammary gland development, paracrine signaling, steroid hormone mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, lung alveolus development, regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, and progesterone receptor signaling pathway.

The Progesterone Receptor is also involved in various cellular components, including nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. It has various molecular functions, including RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding, transcription coactivator binding, DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific, DNA binding, DNA-binding transcription factor activity, nuclear steroid receptor activity, nuclear receptor activity, steroid binding, zinc ion binding, lipid binding, enzyme binding, identical protein binding, sequence-specific DNA binding, and metal ion binding.
