The Computer Activity databases are a collection of computer systems activity measures. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation with megabytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very CPU-bound programs. The data was collected continuously on two separate occasions. On both occasions, system activity was gathered every few seconds. The final dataset is taken from both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming from each collection epoch.

System measures used include reads and writes between system memory and user memory, number of system calls of various types, characters transferred by read and write calls, page out requests, pages paged out, pages placed on the free list, pages checked for freeing, page attaches, page-in requests, pages paged in, page faults caused by protection errors and address translation, process run queue size, memory pages available to user processes, disk blocks available for page swapping, and portions of time CPUs run in different modes or are idle.

Two different regression tasks are obtained from these databases. The first task, CompAct, aims to predict the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode from all attributes excluding paging information. The second task, CompAct(s), predicts the same variable using a restricted number of attributes.

The original source of this data was the DELVE repository. It was later included in a collection of regression datasets. The dataset consists of thousands of cases with continuous attributes including system reads and writes, system calls, character transfers, queue size, available memory and swap space, and CPU utilization.
