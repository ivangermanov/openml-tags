Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Appetency

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is defined to take in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean value. It returns a dataset after performing the necessary subsampling operations.

The function first initializes a random number generator with the provided seed. It then selects a subset of classes from the unique classes present in the dataset, ensuring that the number of selected classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. The indices where these selected classes are present are then used to subset the data.

If the number of columns in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of columns, the function uniformly samples columns to reduce the dimensionality. It then checks if the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of rows. If so, it performs stratified sampling to reduce the number of rows while maintaining the class distribution.

The function finally returns a dataset with the subsampled data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
