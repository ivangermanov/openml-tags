FOREX USDCHF Day High

Tags: Finance, Forex, Forex Day, Forex High, Social Media, Text and Literature

This dataset provides the historical price data of the FOREX USD/CHF pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans a specific period of time and excludes weekends, as the FOREX market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high price of the following day relative to the mean high price of the current day. In other words, if the mean high price increases the following day, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions. Realistic trade strategies require predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.

* Timestamp: The time of the current data point in the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.
