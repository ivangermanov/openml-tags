**Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000)**
Tags: Demographics, Machine Learning

Information about customers consists of eighty-six variables and includes product usage data and socio-demographic data derived from zip area codes. The data was supplied by the Dutch data mining company Sentient Machine Research and is based on a real-world business problem.

The training set contains over five thousand descriptions of customers, including the information of whether or not they have a caravan insurance policy. A test set contains four thousand customers of whom only the organizers know if they have a caravan insurance policy.

The data dictionary describes the variables used and their values:

Each record consists of eighty-six attributes, containing sociodemographic data and product ownership. The sociodemographic data is derived from zip codes. All customers living in areas with the same zip code have the same sociodemographic attributes. 

Attribute "Caravan", the number of mobile home policies, is the target variable. 

All the variables starting with Mostype are zipcode variables. They give information on the distribution of that variable, for example, Rented House, in the zipcode area of the customer.
