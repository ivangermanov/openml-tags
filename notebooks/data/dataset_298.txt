The coil2000 dataset, sourced from UCI, contains information about insurance company customers. This benchmark dataset includes 86 variables covering product usage and socio-demographic data derived from zip area codes. It's based on a real-world business problem provided by a Dutch data mining company.

The training set comprises over 5000 customer descriptions, including whether they have a caravan insurance policy. A separate test set contains 4000 customers with undisclosed policy information. The data dictionary meticulously describes the variables and their values.

Attributes encompass sociodemographic data (attributes one through forty-three) and product ownership (attributes forty-four through eighty-six). Sociodemographic data is derived from zip codes, meaning all customers in the same zip code area share identical sociodemographic attributes. The target variable is "CARAVAN," representing the number of mobile home policies.

Variables prefixed with "M" are zipcode variables, providing information on the distribution of various factors within the customer's zipcode area, such as housing type, household size, age, religion, marital status, education level, occupation, social class, car ownership, and income brackets.

Product-related attributes include contributions and numbers of various insurance policies, such as third-party insurance, car policies, life insurance, accident insurance, fire policies, and more.

The dataset includes detailed value labels for customer subtypes, age groups, main customer types, and contribution ranges for different insurance types. This comprehensive information allows for in-depth analysis of customer profiles and their insurance preferences.
