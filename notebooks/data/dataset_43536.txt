Chennai Zomato Restaurants Data

Tags: Context

This dataset is a tribute to the rich food scene of my favorite city, Chennai. The content is entirely derived from web-scraping the Zomato Chennai page. The data includes important columns such as the price for two people, top-selling dishes, and the cuisines the restaurant serves. Additionally, it includes the Zomato-given ratings and the number of votes used to come up with that rating. Any field that was unable to be scraped is marked as "invalid".

Acknowledgments

All of the data belongs to Zomato and Zomato only. I would like to extend my gratitude to Zomato for their ever-helpful website. This data should be used only for academic purposes.

Inspiration

I am interested in exploring how prices vary across different areas of Chennai and which cuisine is famous in which areas. I also want to investigate if the data verifies the gentrification of certain areas in Chennai. These are the kinds of questions that I am eager to explore.
