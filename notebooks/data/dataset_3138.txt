QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on CaM kinase kinase beta, a single protein target classified as a calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase. This enzyme is found in Homo sapiens and has several important cellular functions. It is involved in protein phosphorylation, calcium mediated signaling, activation of protein kinase activity, and regulation of autophagy. The protein is located in various cellular compartments including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell projections.

CaM kinase kinase beta has multiple molecular functions such as ATP binding, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and calmodulin binding. It participates in several biological processes including the MAPK cascade, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and cellular response to reactive oxygen species. The enzyme plays a role in important signaling pathways like the CAMKK AMPK cascade and activation of CREB.

This target is relevant for drug discovery efforts and is classified as Tchem in the Pharos database. Structural information is available with multiple PDB entries. The protein has been studied in relation to its involvement in various cellular signaling mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications.
