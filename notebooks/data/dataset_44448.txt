The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses a random number generator to select a subset of the data. The function first selects a subset of the classes, then selects a subset of the columns, and finally selects a subset of the rows. The selection of classes and columns is done uniformly at random, while the selection of rows is done using stratified sampling to ensure that the classes are represented in the same proportion as in the original dataset.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, and the maximum number of classes. It also takes in a boolean argument stratified, which determines whether to use stratified sampling or not.

The function returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. The new dataset has the same structure as the original, but with fewer rows, columns, and classes.

Features: The dataset contains several features, including V One, V Five, V Six, V Eight, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, V Twenty-Two, and a class feature.

Keywords: dataset subsampling, stratified sampling, random number generator, feature selection, class representation.
