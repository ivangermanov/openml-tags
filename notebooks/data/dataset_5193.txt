The Weather Test dataset is a tiny collection of data that we will utilize repeatedly to demonstrate various machine learning methodologies. This entirely fictional dataset supposedly revolves around the conditions deemed suitable for engaging in an unspecified outdoor game.

In general, instances within a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure diverse aspects of said instance. In this particular scenario, there exist four attributes that describe each instance: the overall outlook, the ambient temperature, the relative humidity, and the presence of wind. The ultimate outcome is determined by whether it is deemed acceptable to engage in the aforementioned outdoor activity or not.
