The QSAR-TID-10003 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10003. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features, representing FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The features represent molecular fingerprints that were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cathepsin D, a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as Cathepsin D, Cathepsin D heavy chain, and Cathepsin D light chain. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, aspartic protease, aspartic protease AA clan, and aspartic protease A one A subfamily.

According to Expression Atlas, this protein has multiple functions, including being located in the extracellular region, extracellular space, lysosome, lysosomal membrane, endosome membrane, endosome lumen, specific granule lumen, melanosome, lysosomal lumen, membrane raft, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, extracellular exosome, tertiary granule lumen, and ficolin-one-rich granule lumen.

It also has multiple functions, including endopeptidase activity, aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and aspartic-type peptidase activity. Additionally, it participates in multiple processes, including autophagosome assembly, proteolysis, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class two, insulin receptor recycling, lipoprotein catabolic process, positive regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process, regulation of establishment of protein localization, and insulin catabolic process.
