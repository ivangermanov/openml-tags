QSAR-TID-10003 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10003. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Cathepsin D protein, which is a single protein target. Cathepsin D is an enzyme that belongs to the aspartic protease family and is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, autophagosome assembly, and antigen processing and presentation.

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, liver, and kidney, and is involved in several diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and ceroid lipofuscinosis.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the Cathepsin D protein target.

Keywords: QSAR, Cathepsin D, molecular fingerprints, drug target, proteolysis, autophagosome assembly, antigen processing and presentation.
