Title of Database: Annealing Data

The Annealing Data dataset is a collection of information related to the process of annealing, which involves heating and cooling metal to alter its properties.

The dataset contains eight hundred ninety-eight instances, each described by thirty-eight attributes. These attributes include both continuous and discrete variables, such as the type of steel used, the level of carbon present, and the surface finish of the resulting product.

There are six continuously valued attributes, including the carbon content and hardness of the steel. Additionally, there are three integer-valued attributes and twenty-nine nominal-valued attributes, which describe characteristics such as the type of product being made, the condition of the steel, and the desired surface quality.

The dataset also includes a class attribute, which indicates one of five possible outcomes, ranging from one to five, or Unknown. The distribution of these outcomes is uneven, with most instances falling into class three.

All missing values in the dataset have been replaced with a nominal value labeled "Not Applicable". This is because these values are not truly missing, but rather indicate that a particular attribute does not apply to the given instance.

The dataset has been preprocessed to replace all missing values with the "Not Applicable" label. However, this approach is not recommended, and users are advised to use the original version of the dataset instead.
