This dataset belongs to the Me Too movement on Twitter, a social media platform where users share their thoughts and opinions. The Me Too movement was a widespread campaign against sexual harassment incidents, and many people posted various tweets expressing their outrage and frustration. Using this dataset, we can build a model that can accurately classify hatred and non-hatred tweets to restrict the spread of hateful content.

The dataset contains several columns that provide information about each tweet. The columns include the Status ID, which is a unique identifier for each tweet, the Text of the tweet itself, the timestamp of when the tweet was created, the Favourite Count, which indicates how many users have favourited the tweet, the Retweet Count, which shows how many times the tweet has been retweeted, the Location mentioned by the user while tweeting, the Followers Count, which is the number of followers the user has, the Friends Count, which is the number of friends the user has, and the Statuses Count, which is the total number of statuses the user has posted. The Category column is the target variable, which indicates whether the tweet belongs to the hatred category or the non-hatred category.
