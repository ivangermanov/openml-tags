This is the historical price data of the Foreign Exchange Swiss Franc/Japanese Yen from Dukascopy. One instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on these days. The time zone of the feature Timestamp is Europe Amsterdam.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following day, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is trending upward the following day, and false when the mean High price is trending downward or remains stagnant the following day.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trade strategies can only be applied to predictions based on Close attributes, which are also available.**
