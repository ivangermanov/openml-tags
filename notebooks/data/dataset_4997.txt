Andes Bayesian Network. Sample One.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this dataset.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. It consists of two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, resulting in one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, and the average degree is around three point zero three. The maximum in-degree is six.

This network is used for online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It models the problem-solving process of students in a physics-based domain.

Features include goal-oriented nodes, resolve nodes, choose nodes, identify nodes, and many others.
