The QSAR-TID-100452 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100452. This dataset has forty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was scraped from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It shows activity values in units of pseudo-pCI fifty of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred forty-five fifty-two.

The target protein is a cysteine protease known as falcipain-three, which is a single protein. It belongs to the species group Plasmodium falciparum and is classified as an enzyme, protease, cysteine protease, CA clan, and cysteine protease C one A family.

Falcipain-three is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, and has peptidase activity and cysteine-type peptidase activity. It is located in the membrane and has been annotated with several Gene Ontology terms, including membrane, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, and proteolysis.

Falcipain-three has also been annotated with several cross-references, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. It has six InterPro annotations, including Pept cys AS, Peptidase C one A C, Peptidase C one A, Prot inhib I twenty-nine, Papain-like cys pep sf, and Peptidase C one A papain-like. It also has two Pfam annotations, including Peptidase C one and Inhibitor I twenty-nine.
