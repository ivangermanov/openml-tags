This study utilizes data from the nineteen eighty-eight March Current Population Survey to sample the data. The March Current Population Survey contains information on previous year's wages, schooling, industry, and occupation. We select a sample of men between eighteen and seventy years old with positive annual income greater than fifty dollars in nineteen ninety-two, who are not self-employed nor working without pay. The wage data is deflated by the deflator of Personal Consumption Expenditure for nineteen ninety-two.
