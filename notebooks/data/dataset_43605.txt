Sales Data Set of Super Market
Tags: The Story

This data set was part of my online course material for Data Analysis using Python. The contents of this dataset are very useful for beginners and novice number crunchers looking to run queries in a relatable and easy-to-understand dataset. It includes the data about shoppers of a supermarket chain having different locations and the total of their purchases.

The dataset is a collection of information about customers who shop at a supermarket chain with multiple locations. It provides details about the total amount spent by each customer, making it an ideal dataset for those who are new to data analysis.
