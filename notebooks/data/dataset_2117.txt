QSAR-TID-30050 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30050. It has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains demographic information and is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset should be cited as follows: MetaQSAR project - September two thousand fifteen.

The target is Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Four, also known as KIAA zero two one three, MAP three K four, MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase Four, MAPKKK four, MAP Three Kinase One.

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and STE protein kinase group, specifically an STE eleven family.

It is described as having relationships with accession number Q nine Y six R four.

The dataset includes information from various sources, such as Expression Atlas, Go Component, Go Function, and Go Process.
