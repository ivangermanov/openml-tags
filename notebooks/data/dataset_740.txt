The Analcatdata Negotiation dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this modified version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset explores various aspects of negotiation, including the role of individuals involved, their status, trust levels, and the outcome favorability. Additionally, it examines procedural fairness in negotiations.

Features of this dataset include Role, Status, Trust, Outcome Favorability, and Procedural Fairness, which have been transformed into a binary classification system.
