Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The resulting dataset contains various 'oz' features and a binary class feature, making it suitable for classification tasks and studies related to mythbusting and various other research areas.
