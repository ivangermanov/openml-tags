This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target. 

The dataset covers various aspects of drug design and molecular properties, including melting point prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), biodegradability, toxicity, and protein engineering. It incorporates data from multiple sources and studies focused on different chemical compounds and their properties.

Some key areas explored in the dataset include:

- Molecular descriptors influencing melting points of solid drugs
- Neighborhood behavior for validating molecular diversity descriptors
- General melting point prediction using diverse compound datasets
- Modeling physicochemical properties of polyaromatic hydrocarbons
- Prediction of biological activity for PDGFR inhibitors
- Structure-activity analyses for various compounds
- Toxicity and biodegradability of anilines and phenols
- Acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds
- Biodegradability of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans
- Dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds
- Stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion
- Structure-activity relationships of antifilarial antimycin analogues

The dataset incorporates a wide range of molecular descriptors and features, allowing for comprehensive analysis of chemical structures and their properties. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers in drug design, medicinal chemistry, and related fields.
