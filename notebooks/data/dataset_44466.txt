Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup 09 Upselling

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is used to reduce the size of the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows and columns, and the maximum number of classes. The function first selects a subset of classes using a stratified sampling approach, ensuring that the resulting dataset has a balanced distribution of classes. It then selects a random subset of columns and rows from the original dataset.

The function uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility. It first selects the unique classes present in the dataset and then chooses a subset of these classes based on their frequency. The indices of the rows corresponding to these classes are then selected, and the dataset is reduced to only include these rows. The function then selects a random subset of columns from the reduced dataset.

If the number of rows in the reduced dataset is still larger than the maximum allowed, the function uses a stratified sampling approach to select a subset of rows. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a balanced distribution of classes. The function returns a new dataset object with the reduced data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
