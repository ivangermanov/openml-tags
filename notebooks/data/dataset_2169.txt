MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-12694

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12694. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Features:

MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID
FCFP Six One Two Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints
...

The dataset was generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TYK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including immune response, cell differentiation, and regulation of multicellular organismal processes.

The enzyme is involved in the transmission of signals from cytokine receptors and is known to interact with several proteins, including growth hormone receptors, interleukin-twelve receptors, and type one interferon receptors.

Inhibition of Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TYK2 has been implicated in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Several small molecules have been developed to inhibit the enzyme, including Deucravacitinib, Brepocitinib, Cerdulatinib, and Ropsacitinib.
