This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred two nine twenty-seven, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, numerous fingerprint features representing six one two four bit molecular fingerprints, and other relevant identifiers.

This dataset contains information about melanin concentrating hormone receptor one, which is a single protein preferred name, also known as gpr twenty-four, mch one r, and mchr. It is classified under one membrane receptor family a g protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family a gpcr short peptide receptor family a gpcr mch receptor.

It is associated with organism rattus norvegicus species group, and its protein target classification is one point membrane receptor family a g protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family a gpcr short peptide receptor family a gpcr mch receptor.

Additionally, it has multiple relationships including description relationship accession melanin concentrating hormone receptor one single protein p ninety-seven six three nine, and multiple go components, functions, processes, and other relevant annotations.
