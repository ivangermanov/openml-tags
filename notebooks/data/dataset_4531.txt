**Parkinsons Telemonitoring**

Tags: **Author**

The dataset was created in collaboration with ten medical centers in the United States and Intel Corporation, who developed the telemonitoring device to record speech signals.

Data Set Information:

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patients' homes. The dataset contains subject information, including age and gender, as well as the time interval from the baseline recruitment date. Additionally, it includes the motor and total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, which are the primary targets for prediction. The dataset also includes sixteen biomedical voice measures, which are used to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores.

The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores from the biomedical voice measures. The data is in ASCII CSV format, with each row corresponding to one voice recording. There are approximately two hundred recordings per patient, and the subject number of the patient is identified in the first column.

The dataset is based on the following reference: Accurate Telemonitoring of Parkinson's Disease Progression by Non-Invasive Speech Tests.

Attribute Information:

The dataset contains the following attributes: subject number, age, gender, time since recruitment into the trial, motor UPDRS score, total UPDRS score, and sixteen biomedical voice measures. These voice measures include several measures of variation in fundamental frequency, amplitude, and noise to tonal components in the voice, as well as nonlinear dynamical complexity measures and signal fractal scaling exponent.

Relevant Papers:

The dataset is based on several papers, including Suitability of Dysphonia Measurements for Telemonitoring of Parkinson's Disease and Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection.
