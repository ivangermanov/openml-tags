Parkinsons Telemonitoring 

Tags: Health, Medicine 

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patients' homes. Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, total UPDRS score, and sixteen biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of the numerous voice recordings from these individuals. 

The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores from the sixteen voice measures. The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are approximately two hundred recordings per patient; the subject number of the patient is identified in the first column. 

Attribute Information:

* Subject Number: An integer that uniquely identifies each subject.
* Age: Subject age.
* Sex: Subject gender, where zero represents male and one represents female.
* Test Time: Time since recruitment into the trial, where the integer part is the number of days since recruitment.
* Motor UPDRS Score: Clinician's motor UPDRS score, linearly interpolated.
* Total UPDRS Score: Clinician's total UPDRS score, linearly interpolated.

Biomedical voice measures include several measures of variation in fundamental frequency, such as jitter, and several measures of variation in amplitude, including shimmer. Additionally, there are two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice, namely Noise to Harmonic Ratio (NHR) and Harmonic to Noise Ratio (HNR), as well as a nonlinear dynamical complexity measure, namely Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and a signal fractal scaling exponent, namely Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). Lastly, there is a nonlinear measure of fundamental frequency variation, namely Pitch Period Entropy (PPE).
