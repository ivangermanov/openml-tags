Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the key change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing all instances below this mean as positive ('P') and all instances above as negative ('N'). This binarization process transforms the dataset into a two-class problem, suitable for binary classification tasks. The dataset includes several features labeled as 'oz' followed by numbers, suggesting they may represent different measurements or attributes. The final feature is labeled as 'binary Class', which likely represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.
