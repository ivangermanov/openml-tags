QSAR-TID-218 Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 218. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The scrap data provides information about the target protein, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification.

The target protein is an alpha-two-C adrenergic receptor, which is a single protein and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is primarily involved in the signal transduction process and is a receptor for the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.

The dataset also provides information about the expression atlas, gene ontology, and pathways related to this target protein.
