The Student Performance in Portuguese dataset approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, which were collected using school reports and questionnaires. There are two datasets in the original database, regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese Language.

This version of the original dataset contains only the latter. Note that the target attribute Final Grade has a strong correlation with First Period Grade and Second Period Grade. This occurs because Final Grade is the final year grade issued at the third period, while First Period Grade and Second Period Grade correspond to the first and second period grades. It is more difficult to predict Final Grade without First Period Grade and Second Period Grade, but such prediction is much more useful.

The dataset includes thirty-three attributes that describe the students' characteristics, such as their school, gender, age, home address type, family size, parent's cohabitation status, mother's education, father's education, mother's job, father's job, reason to choose this school, guardian, travel time to school, weekly study time, number of past class failures, extra educational support, family educational support, extra paid classes, extracurricular activities, attendance in nursery school, desire to pursue higher education, internet access at home, romantic relationship, quality of family relationships, free time after school, going out with friends, workday and weekend alcohol consumption, current health status, and number of school absences.

Additionally, there are three grades related to the course subject, Portuguese Language: First Period Grade, Second Period Grade, and Final Grade.
