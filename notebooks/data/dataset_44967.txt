**Data Description**

This dataset approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, which were collected using school reports and questionnaires. There are two datasets in the original database, regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language. This version of the original dataset contains only the latter.

**Attribute Description**

The dataset includes attributes such as the student's school, sex, age, address type, family size, parent's cohabitation status, mother's education, father's education, mother's job, father's job, reason to choose this school, student's guardian, travel time to school, weekly study time, number of past class failures, extra educational support, family educational support, extra paid classes, extra-curricular activities, attendance of nursery school, desire to take higher education, internet access at home, romantic relationship status, quality of family relationships, free time after school, going out with friends, workday and weekend alcohol consumption, current health status, and number of school absences.

Additionally, the dataset includes grades related to the course subject, Portuguese language, such as the first period grade, second period grade, and final grade, which is the target feature.

**Important Note**

The target attribute, final grade, has a strong correlation with the first period grade and second period grade. This occurs because the final grade is issued at the third period, while the first and second period grades correspond to the first and second period grades. It is more difficult to predict the final grade without the first and second period grades, but such prediction is much more useful.
