**Adult Dataset**

This dataset is tagged under Chemistry and Life Science.

The original Adult data set has fourteen features, among which six are continuous and eight are categorical. In this dataset, continuous features are discretized into quantiles, and each quantile is represented by a binary feature. Additionally, a categorical feature with multiple categories is converted to multiple binary features.

Details on how each feature is converted can be found in the beginning of each file from this page.

Features include age, work class, education level, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country, among others.
