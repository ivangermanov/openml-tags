**QSAR-TID-102678**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ErbB-3, and it has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.
