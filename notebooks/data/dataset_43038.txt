**Dow Jones Index Data Set**

In our research, each record is data for a week, and each record also has the percentage of return that stock has in the following week, which is the ideal goal to determine which stock will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week. This can help you train and test your algorithm. Some of these attributes might not be used in your research, as they were originally added to our database to perform calculations. The dataset includes various attributes, such as the yearly quarter, stock symbol, date, open price, high price, low price, close price, volume, percentage change in price, percentage change in volume over the last week, previous week's volume, next week's open price, next week's close price, percentage change in price of the stock in the following week, days to next dividend, and percentage of return on the next dividend.

The dataset is divided into training and testing data, where the first quarter data is used for training and the second quarter data is used for testing. An interesting data point to note is that if you use the second quarter data for testing, you will notice that every Dow Jones Index stock lost money in the week ending May twenty-seventh, two thousand and eleven.
