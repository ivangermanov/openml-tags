The Amazon Commerce Reviews dataset is tagged with Chemistry, Life Science, and Study. This dataset was derived from customer reviews on the Amazon Commerce website for authorship identification.

Most previous studies conducted identification experiments for a limited number of authors, typically between two to ten. However, in an online context, reviews to be identified usually have many more potential authors. Moreover, classification algorithms are often not adapted to handle a large number of target classes. 

To examine the robustness of classification algorithms, this dataset was created by identifying fifty of the most active users who frequently posted reviews. Each user is represented by a unique identifier and username. The dataset includes thirty reviews collected for each author.

The attributes included in this dataset encompass various aspects of an author's linguistic style. These include the usage of digits, punctuation, word length, sentence length, and the frequency of word usage.

The dataset consists of numerous features that capture the nuances of an author's writing style.

This comprehensive dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on authorship identification tasks, particularly in the context of online reviews.
