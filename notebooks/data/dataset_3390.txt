QSAR-TID-100427 Dataset: Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand four hundred twenty-seven, and it has seventy-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, among others.
