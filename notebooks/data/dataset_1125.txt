Please cite: GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be used for benchmarking gene expression oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be utilized for estimating various quality metrics (such as accuracy, precision, area under ROC curve, etc.) for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms. This repository was inspired by an increasing need in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems that could be used by different researchers. This approach allows for the comparison of various classification and feature selection techniques on a standardized set of problems.

Origin of data: Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available expO (Expression Project For Oncology) repository maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary goal of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without intellectual property restrictions. This information availability translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to use data from the expO repository was made due to several factors:
- Consistency of tissue sample processing procedures
- Uniform microarray platform used for all samples
- Availability of additional information for combined genotype phenotype studies
- Access to a large number of samples for different tumor types

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, please acknowledge the assistance received by using this repository. This will help others obtain the same datasets and replicate your experiments. You are also encouraged to acknowledge the contribution of expO (Expression Project For Oncology) and the International Genomics Consortium for providing their gene expression samples to the public.

Features: The dataset includes numerous gene expression features, represented by probe set identifiers. These features correspond to various genes and genetic markers analyzed in the study.
