Thyroid Allbp Dataset

The UCI Thyroid Allbp dataset provides information on demographics and consists of several studies, including Study One Forty Four, Study Fifty, and Study Fifty Two. This dataset contains a range of features, although they are not easily interpretable.

The dataset was sourced from the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia, and includes six databases with approximately equal proportions of training and test instances. However, it is notable that there is a significant amount of missing data present.

In addition to the primary datasets, two further databases were included, although they are believed to be corrupted. These databases have a similar format to the others but may not be reliable.

A separate thyroid dataset covers twenty classes and includes a related domain theory. This dataset has no missing values. Furthermore, another thyroid dataset suitable for training artificial neural networks is also available, which consists of three classes and includes cost data.
