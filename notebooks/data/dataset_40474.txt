Thyroid Allbp Dataset

The UCI Thyroid Allbp dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to thyroid issues. This dataset contains a significant number of features, including various attributes that are either Boolean or continuously valued.

The dataset is comprised of six databases from the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia. Each database has a substantial number of training instances and test instances, with a considerable amount of missing data. The attributes in the dataset are a mix of Boolean and continuously valued features.

In addition to the six databases, there are two more databases that are also part of this collection. However, it is believed that these databases have been corrupted and their format is highly similar to the other databases.

Furthermore, there is another thyroid database that covers twenty classes and has a related domain theory. This database has a large number of instances and no missing values.

Another dataset, suited for training Artificial Neural Networks, has three classes and includes cost data. This dataset has a significant number of training instances and testing instances.
