Heart Disease Databases

This dataset contains information related to heart disease diagnosis collected from four locations: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, and University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

While the original databases contain 76 raw attributes, only 14 are typically used in experiments. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in patients, with values ranging from 0 (no presence) to 4. Many experiments focus on distinguishing presence (values 1-4) from absence (value 0).

The datasets have been anonymized, with patient names and social security numbers replaced by dummy values. The Cleveland database has been the most commonly used by machine learning researchers.

Number of instances:
Cleveland: 303
Hungarian: 294
Switzerland: 123
Long Beach VA: 200

Attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thalassemia, and the diagnosis of heart disease.

The datasets contain missing values, which are distinguished with the value -9.0.

Class distribution varies across the databases, with the presence and severity of heart disease represented by different proportions in each dataset.

Relevant experiments and studies have been conducted using these databases, including probability analysis for coronary artery disease diagnosis, instance based prediction, and conceptual clustering. Various machine learning techniques have been applied, achieving accuracy rates generally between 74% and 81%.

The data has been used in several publications, and the original collectors request that their names and institutions be cited in any resulting research papers.

This heart disease dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying cardiovascular health, diagnostic techniques, and the application of machine learning in medical contexts.
