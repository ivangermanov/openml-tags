Heart Disease Databases

This directory contains four databases concerning heart disease diagnosis. All attributes are numeric-valued. The data was collected from four different locations: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest, V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA, and University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.

Each database has the same instance format. Although the databases have seventy-six raw attributes, only fourteen of them are actually used. Therefore, two copies of each database were created: one with all the attributes and one with the fourteen attributes actually used in past experiments.

The authors of the databases have requested that any publications resulting from the use of the data include the names of the principal investigators responsible for the data collection at each institution.

This database contains seventy-six attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of fourteen of them. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from zero (no presence) to four. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values one, two, three, four) from absence (value zero).

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been processed, that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

Only fourteen attributes are used, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by flourosopy, and diagnosis of heart disease.

Several missing attribute values are distinguished with a value of negative nine point zero.

Class distribution varies across the four databases, with the majority of instances belonging to class zero (absence of heart disease).
