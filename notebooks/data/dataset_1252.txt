Credit Card Dataset

The Credit Card dataset contains transactions made by European credit card holders in September 2013. This dataset presents transactions that occurred over a period of two days, featuring a total of 492 fraudulent transactions out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for a mere fraction of all transactions.

The dataset comprises solely numerical input variables, which are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. Due to confidentiality concerns, the original features and additional background information regarding the data cannot be disclosed.

The dataset includes features such as Time, which represents the number of seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, and Amount, which denotes the transaction amount. This latter feature can be utilized for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. The Class feature serves as the response variable, taking on a value of one in cases of fraud and zero otherwise.

This dataset was compiled and analyzed during a collaborative research effort between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles on big data mining and fraud detection. Further information on ongoing and past projects related to these topics can be accessed via the following websites: BruFence and ARTML.
