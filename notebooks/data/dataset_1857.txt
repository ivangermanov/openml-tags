The QSAR-TID-103726 dataset, tagged with Life Science, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR, is part of the MetaQSAR project, released in September 2015.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103726. It comprises three hundred forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

It provides information about the Neuropeptides B/W Receptor Type One, a single protein preferred name, also known as GPR Seven, G-Protein Coupled Receptor Seven, Neuropeptides B/W Receptor Type One, and NPBW R One.

This receptor belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under one membrane receptor, family A G-protein coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

Its description highlights its role in signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of metabolic process, and G-protein coupled opioid receptor signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, Neuropeptides B/W Receptor Type One, G-protein coupled receptor, signal transduction.
