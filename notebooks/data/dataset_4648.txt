Phishing Websites Seed Three Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the Phishing Websites dataset generated using a specific set of arguments. The dataset has been sampled to include only a certain number of rows, columns, and classes, with an emphasis on maintaining a balanced representation of each class.

The sampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the chosen classes were representative of the overall distribution. This was achieved through a probabilistic approach, where each class was assigned a weight based on its frequency in the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset were sampled uniformly to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This step helped to eliminate redundant or irrelevant features, resulting in a more streamlined dataset.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were sampled to achieve the desired number of observations. This step was performed using a stratified approach, which ensured that the sampling process maintained the balance between classes.

The resulting dataset consists of a carefully curated selection of features, including website attributes such as domain registration length, favicon presence, and HTTP token presence, among others.
