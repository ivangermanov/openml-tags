Description:
The Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset contains measurements from chemical sensors used in simulations for drift compensation in a discrimination task of gases at various concentration levels. The primary goal is to achieve good performance or minimal degradation over time. This dataset is made freely accessible to the chemosensor research community and artificial intelligence researchers to develop strategies for coping with sensor and concept drift. It is to be used exclusively for research purposes, with commercial use strictly prohibited.

The dataset was collected over 36 months from January 2007 to February 2011 in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system was fully computerized and controlled by LabVIEW's National Instruments software, minimizing human error and allowing focus on chemical sensors for compensating real drift.

The dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances: Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene. Each substance was dosed at various concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. An extended version of this dataset with concentration values is available separately.

Attribute Information:
The sensor responses are recorded as resistance across the active layer of each sensor. Each measurement produces a 16-channel time series, represented by features reflecting dynamic processes at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance. Two types of features were considered:

1. The steady-state feature (Delta R), defined as the difference between the maximal resistance change and the baseline, and its normalized version.

2. An aggregate of features reflecting sensor dynamics during the measurement procedure, namely the exponential moving average (ema alpha).

These features are transformed into a 128-dimensional feature vector containing information from all 16 sensors. The dataset includes six possible classes corresponding to the six gaseous substances.

The dataset is valuable for developing and testing drift compensation strategies in chemical sensing applications and machine learning algorithms dealing with concept drift.
