Machine Learning and Mathematics Subsampling of the dataset MFEAT Factors with a specific configuration. 

This dataset is generated through a process of subsampling, which involves reducing the number of samples and features while maintaining the overall characteristics of the original dataset. The goal of this exercise is to create a smaller yet representative dataset that can be used for machine learning model training and testing.

The subsampling process involves several steps. First, the classes are uniformly sampled to ensure that the resulting dataset has a balanced distribution of classes. This is done by selecting a specified number of classes randomly, using their value counts as probabilities. 

Next, the columns are uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. This is achieved by randomly selecting a specified number of column indices, sorting them, and then using these indices to select the corresponding columns from the original dataset.

Finally, the rows are sampled using stratified sampling to maintain the class balance. This involves concatenating the feature columns with the target column, splitting the data into subsets based on the target column, and then selecting a specified number of rows randomly from each subset.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, including attributes four, five, eight, ten, twelve, thirteen, sixteen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-eight, thirty-two, thirty-four, thirty-six, forty, forty-one, forty-four, forty-five, forty-seven, forty-eight, fifty, fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-five, sixty-eight, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-four, seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine, eighty-one, eighty-four, eighty-six, ninety, ninety-one, ninety-two, ninety-three, one hundred two, one hundred four, one hundred six, one hundred eight, one hundred eleven, one hundred fourteen, one hundred fifteen, one hundred sixteen, one hundred seventeen, one hundred eighteen, one hundred nineteen, one hundred twenty, one hundred twenty-one, one hundred twenty-two, one hundred twenty-four, one hundred twenty-six, one hundred twenty-seven, one hundred thirty-two, one hundred thirty-eight, one hundred thirty-nine, one hundred forty-one, one hundred forty-three, one hundred forty-five, one hundred forty-six, one hundred fifty-four, one hundred fifty-seven, one hundred fifty-eight, one hundred fifty-nine, one hundred sixty, one hundred sixty-one, one hundred sixty-four, one hundred sixty-six, one hundred sixty-nine, one hundred seventy-one, one hundred seventy-three, one hundred seventy-four, one hundred seventy-eight, one hundred eighty, one hundred eighty-two, one hundred eighty-five, one hundred eighty-six, one hundred eighty-seven, one hundred eighty-nine, one hundred ninety-two, one hundred ninety-four.
