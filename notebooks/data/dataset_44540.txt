Subsampling of the dataset Albert with a random seed of two, maximum number of rows of two thousand, maximum number of columns of one hundred, and maximum number of classes of ten, with stratification set to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It first uniformly samples the classes, then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly and selects a subset.

The function returns a new dataset with the selected features, target variable, and categorical mask.
