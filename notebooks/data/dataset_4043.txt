QSAR-TID-103458 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103458. The dataset has seventy-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103458. The features of the dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the molecular structure of the compounds, as well as their activity values against the drug target. The molecular structure is represented by FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that captures the structural features of a molecule. The activity values are represented by the Median PXc50, which is a measure of the potency of a compound against a specific drug target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for a specific drug target.
