The QSAR-TID-103458 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103458. This dataset has seventy-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103458.

The molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50 features are included in this dataset. The remaining features are molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the chemical structure of each compound.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to predict the activity of new compounds on drug target TID: 103458. By analyzing the relationships between the molecular structures and activity values, researchers can identify patterns and trends that can inform the design of new compounds.
