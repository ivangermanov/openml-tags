The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded to convey information about the characteristics of each dataset, specifically the level of colinearity and the number of samples and features present.

These datasets were created using Friedman functions, which include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, with a normalized noise component added to the output. 

The Friedman function itself is a complex equation that combines multiple input variables in a nonlinear fashion, with an additional error term.

To test the effects of unrelated features on machine learning algorithms, additional features were generated independently of the output variable. 

Furthermore, to evaluate an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, datasets were generated with varying levels of interdependence among features, ranging from complete independence to high levels of correlation.

The resulting Friedman datasets exhibit a range of characteristics, including varying numbers of features, samples, and levels of collinearity.
