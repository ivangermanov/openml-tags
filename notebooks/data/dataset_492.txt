Data on fluctuating proportions of marked cells in marrow from heterozygous Safari cats from a study of early hematopoiesis. The data included are time series of proportions of marked progenitor cells from the bone marrow of the hybrid Safari cat. These data come from experiments done at the University of Washington, Seattle. There are four columns and multiple records. The first column is an identifier for the cat in the study. The second column records the time, in weeks from the start of monitoring, that the measurement from marrow is recorded. The third column gives the percent of domestic type progenitor cells observed in a sample of cells at that time. The fourth column gives the sample size at that time, which is the number of progenitor cells analyzed. For background on the data, see several publications in Blood, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and IMA Journal of Mathematical Applications in Medicine and Biology. These particular data are used in an analysis titled "Stochastic Modeling of Early Hematopoiesis." The dataset provides valuable information for studying the dynamics of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor populations in a feline model, offering insights into the processes of blood cell production and regeneration.
