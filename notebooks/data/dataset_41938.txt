MIP 2016 PAR10 Regression Dataset

This dataset is part of the Open Algorithm Challenge and contains PAR10 performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of MIPLIB 2010. The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the evaluations of the solvers. The features were generated using the MIP feature computation code, and to record runtimes of the feature computations, a runsolver was used.

The dataset includes a wide range of features, including problem type, number of variables, number of constraints, number of non-zero coefficients, and many others. These features provide a comprehensive description of the mixed-integer programming problems and can be used to analyze and predict the performance of solvers.

The dataset is particularly useful for algorithm selection, as it provides a large collection of instances with varying characteristics, allowing for a thorough evaluation of different solvers and their performance on different types of problems.
