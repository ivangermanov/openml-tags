Rabe Dataset Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification system allows for a more simplified analysis of the data. The resulting classes are labeled as either Positive or Negative.

Features: The dataset includes several columns, although their specific titles are not descriptive.
