This dataset is part of forty-one drug design datasets. These datasets were created using Adriana.Code software, which can be found at www.molecular-networks.com/software/adrianacode. The molecules and their corresponding outputs were taken directly from the original studies.

The original studies include Carbolenes, which was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen ninety-six. Another study is MTP two, which was published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science in two thousand three. There are also several other datasets, including Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama one, and Yokoyama two. These datasets were all published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen ninety-six.

Additionally, there is the MTP dataset, which was published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Model in two thousand five. The Benzo thirty-two dataset was published in the European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen ninety-six. There is also the Phenethyl one dataset, which was published in a book titled QSAR Hansch Analysis and Related Approaches in nineteen ninety-three.

Furthermore, the PAH dataset was published in the journal Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems in nineteen ninety-five. The PDGFR dataset was published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science in two thousand four. There is also the Phen dataset, which was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in nineteen seventy-two.

Other datasets include Topo two one and Yprop four one, which were both published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science in two thousand three. There are also the QSABR one, QSABR two, QSARTOX, QSBR RW one, QSBR Y two, QSBRALKS, QSFRDHLS, QSFSR one, QSFSR two, and QSPRCMPX datasets.
