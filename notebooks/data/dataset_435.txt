This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset focuses on various aspects of drug design and molecular properties. It includes information on carbolenes, melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitors, toxicology predictions, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, structure-biodegradability relationships for chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro- and bromo-alkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, protein engineering, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The studies cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, including molecular descriptors, melting points, pharmacological evaluations, molecular modeling, weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors, linear and non-linear models for biological activity prediction, structure-activity analyses, toxicity benchmarking, biodegradation, quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships, quantitative structure-function relationships, quantitative structure-stability relationships, and multivariate pattern recognition studies.

These datasets provide valuable information for researchers in the fields of medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, toxicology, and drug design. They offer insights into various molecular properties and their relationships to biological activities, which can be crucial for developing new drugs and understanding chemical behaviors.
