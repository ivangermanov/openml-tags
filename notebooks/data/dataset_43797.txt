Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset
Tags: Context

The dataset contains laboratory values of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients, as well as demographic values like age. The data was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

All attributes except Category and Sex are numerical. The attributes can be divided into two categories: patient data and laboratory data. The patient data includes the patient's identification number, diagnosis, age, and sex. The diagnosis attribute has four possible values: Blood Donor, Suspect Blood Donor, Hepatitis, and Fibrosis or Cirrhosis.

The laboratory data includes values for Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase, Alanine Transaminase, Aspartate Transaminase, Bilirubin, Cholinesterase, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase, and Protein.

The target attribute for classification is the diagnosis, which distinguishes between blood donors and Hepatitis C patients, including the progression of the disease.

The dataset was created by the Institute of Clinical Chemistry at the Medical University Hannover, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, and Trillium GmbH.

Relevant papers have been published on the use of machine learning techniques to generate laboratory diagnostic pathways, including a case study on Hepatitis C.

Other related datasets include the Stroke Prediction Dataset.
