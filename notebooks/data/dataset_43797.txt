The Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset 

Tags: Health, Life Science 

Context 
This dataset contains laboratory values of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients, along with demographic values such as age. The data was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Content 
All attributes except Category and Sex are numerical. The first four attributes refer to the data of the patient, including Patient ID/Number, diagnosis, age in years, and sex. The remaining ten attributes refer to laboratory data, including Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase, Alanine Transaminase, Aspartate Transaminase, Bilirubin, Cholinesterase, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase, and Protein. 

The target attribute for classification is the diagnosis category, which distinguishes between blood donors and Hepatitis C patients, including its progress stages such as fibrosis and cirrhosis. 

Acknowledgements 
This dataset was created by researchers from the Institute of Clinical Chemistry at the Medical University Hannover, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, and Trillium GmbH.

Relevant Papers 
The dataset has been used in several research studies, including one published in the Journal of Hepatology and another published in the Journal of Laboratory Precision Medicine, which explored the application of machine learning techniques to generate laboratory diagnostic pathways.
