Context: 
This dataset is a subset from the Monitoring the Future Survey of high school students. My focus in working on this dataset is trying to understand the effect that technology use has on academic performance, specifically grades or GPA.

Content: 
The columns are labeled and include information on technology use, such as personal computer use, video game use, and other forms of technology, as well as grades or GPA.

Acknowledgements: 
This dataset is the result of the Monitoring the Future Survey.

Inspiration: 
The main question being explored is whether GPA is affected by the use of technology. Does excessive technology use negatively impact academic performance, or is there no correlation between the two?
