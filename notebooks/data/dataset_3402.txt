This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11081. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit fingerprints.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The target protein, MAP kinase p thirty-eight delta, is a single protein preferred name, also known as MAPK thirteen, MAP kinase thirteen, MAP kinase p thirty-eight delta, and Mitogen-activated protein kinase thirteen. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens, and its protein target classification is one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase MAPK family/CMGC protein kinase p thirty-eight subfamily.

The description of this protein includes its relationship and accession number, as well as its expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process. Its expression atlas includes one item, while its go component includes three items: nucleus, cytoplasm, and cytosol.
