QSAR-TID-11081 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11081. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 delta, which is a protein target involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and inflammation. The protein is a member of the CMGC protein kinase group and is activated by various stimuli, including osmotic stress, UV radiation, and inflammatory cytokines.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 delta target. The data can also be used for understanding the structure-activity relationships of compounds and for identifying potential lead compounds for further optimization.
