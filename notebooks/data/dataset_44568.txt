Machine Learning and Mathematics

Subsampling of the dataset Ada with a random seed generated a new dataset.

The new dataset was created using the following parameters: maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to use stratification.

The function used to create the new dataset first uniformly sampled the classes. If there were more classes than the specified maximum, it selected a subset of classes based on their frequency in the original dataset. It then selected the indices where one of these classes was present.

Next, the function uniformly sampled the columns. If there were more columns than the specified maximum, it randomly chose a subset of column indices and selected the corresponding columns.

Finally, the function sampled the rows. If there were more rows than the specified maximum, it used stratified sampling to select a subset of rows.

The resulting dataset has the same characteristics as the original dataset but with a reduced number of rows, columns, and classes.

Features:
Variable One, Variable Two, ..., Variable Forty Eight, Class
