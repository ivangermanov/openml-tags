Name: Ada Seed Zero Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Ada with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in self, seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses numpy's random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects the features x and target y from the dataset. If the number of unique classes in y is greater than nclasses max, it selects nclasses max classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of y. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates x and y accordingly. If the number of columns in x is greater than ncols max, it uniformly samples ncols max columns and updates x. If the number of rows in x is greater than nrows max, it uses train test split with stratification to sample nrows max rows and updates x and y. Finally, it returns a new dataset with the updated x, y, categorical mask, and columns.
