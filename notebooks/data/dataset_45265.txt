Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - Munin is a massive discrete Bayesian network.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex and challenging model to work with. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes are relatively small, indicating that the network is not overly dense. However, the maximum in-degree of three suggests that some nodes have a significant number of parents.

The Munin network is an expert EMG assistant, designed to provide assistance in electromyography. It is a comprehensive model that takes into account a wide range of factors and variables, making it a valuable tool for medical professionals.

Features of the Munin network include muscle activity, electromyography signals, and various medical conditions. The network is capable of modeling complex relationships between these variables, allowing for accurate predictions and diagnoses.
