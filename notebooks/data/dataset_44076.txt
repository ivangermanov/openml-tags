The MiniBooNE dataset is part of the computer systems and social media datasets used in the tabular data benchmark, specifically transformed for the regression on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset originates from the MiniBooNE experiment, where its primary purpose is to differentiate between electron neutrinos, which are considered signals, and muon neutrinos, regarded as backgrounds. Notably, the dataset follows a specific ordering, where all signal observations precede background observations.

The dataset was previously employed in a research paper focused on boosted decision trees as an alternative to artificial neural networks in particle physics. The research explored the application of machine learning techniques to particle detection.

The dataset comprises various features, including particle identifiers, which are essential in distinguishing between different types of particles.
