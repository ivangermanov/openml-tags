MiniBooNE Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset is taken from the MiniBooNE experiment and is used to distinguish electron neutrinos, which are the signal, from muon neutrinos, which are the background. The dataset is ordered, with all signal observations first, followed by the background observations.

The dataset is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous value based on numerical features. The features in this dataset are related to particle identification, but the exact meaning of each feature is not provided.

Keywords: MiniBooNE, neutrino detection, particle identification, regression, numerical features.
