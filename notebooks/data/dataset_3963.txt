QSAR-TID-243 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 243. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to Aminopeptidase N, a single protein target that is also known as Alanyl Aminopeptidase, Aminopeptidase M, and AP-M. It is an enzyme that belongs to the metallo protease MAE clan and metallo protease M1 family.

Aminopeptidase N is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, proteolysis, cell differentiation, peptide catabolic process, and viral entry into host cells. It is also a receptor for viruses and has peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, and zinc ion binding.
