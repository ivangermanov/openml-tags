QSAR-TID-246 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane A2 receptor, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane A2 receptor. The Thromboxane A2 receptor is a single protein, also known as Prostanoid TP receptor or TBXA2R, and it is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor group. It is a small molecule receptor that is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, inflammatory response, and blood coagulation.

The dataset provides information on the activity of various compounds on the Thromboxane A2 receptor, including their mechanism of action, maximum phase, and first approval. The compounds include Ramatroban, Picotamide, Terutroban, Seratrodast, and Terbogrel, among others.

The Thromboxane A2 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration. It is also involved in the response to various stimuli, including nutrient, xenobiotic, and lipopolysaccharide.
