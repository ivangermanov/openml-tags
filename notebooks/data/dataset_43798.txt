The Google Play Store Apps dataset contains information about apps available on the Google Play Store. This dataset was created using Python and Scrapy, which were run on a Google Cloud virtual machine instance. The data was collected in December.

Acknowledgments 

I would like to acknowledge the significant role played by Google's Cloud engine in helping me build this dataset.

Inspiration 

This project was inspired by another dataset available on Kaggle, which aimed to create a large database for students and researchers.

Features 

This dataset includes a wide range of features related to each app, including its name, category, rating, number of ratings, installs, minimum and maximum installs, whether it is free or paid, price, currency, size, minimum Android version required, developer ID, developer website, developer email, release date, last updated date, content rating, privacy policy, ad support, in-app purchases, and whether it is an editor's choice. It also includes the time when the data was scraped.
