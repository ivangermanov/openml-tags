I have collected a comprehensive dataset with the help of Python and Scrapy, running on a Google Cloud virtual machine instance. The data was collected in December and comprises a vast collection of over one million app data points.

Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to Google's Cloud engine, which played a pivotal role in building this dataset.

Inspiration

This dataset was inspired by a similar project on Kaggle, which aimed to create a large database for students and researchers.

Features

The dataset includes a wide range of attributes, including the app name, category, rating, rating count, installs, minimum and maximum installs, whether the app is free or paid, price, currency, size, minimum Android version, developer ID, developer website, developer email, release date, last updated date, content rating, privacy policy, ad support, in-app purchases, and whether the app is an editor's choice. The dataset also includes the time at which the data was scraped.
