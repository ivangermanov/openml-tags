The Cancer Drug Response Copy Number dataset is a comprehensive collection of features that are crucial in understanding the response of cancer to various drug treatments. This dataset is characterized by a wide range of features that are essential in identifying the genetic markers associated with cancer drug response.

The features in this dataset include genes involved in cell signaling pathways, such as Akt Three, Abelson Interactor One, and Shc Binding Protein Three, which play critical roles in regulating cell growth and proliferation. Additionally, the dataset includes genes involved in cell adhesion, such as Cadherin Ten, Cadherin Eleven, and Cadherin Seventeen, which are essential for maintaining tissue architecture and preventing cancer cell invasion.

Other features in the dataset include genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as Cyclin Dependent Kinase Four and Cyclin Dependent Kinase Six, which are critical for controlling cell division and preventing uncontrolled cell growth. The dataset also includes genes involved in DNA repair, such as Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor Two and General Transcription Factor Ii H, which are essential for maintaining genome stability and preventing cancer.

Furthermore, the dataset includes genes involved in transcriptional regulation, such as Nuclear Receptor Coactivator Two and Ccaat Enhancer Binding Protein Alpha, which play critical roles in regulating gene expression and preventing cancer. The dataset also includes genes involved in chromatin remodeling, such as Chromodomain Helicase Dna Binding Protein Two and Chromodomain Helicase Dna Binding Protein Four, which are essential for maintaining chromatin structure and preventing cancer.
