Name: CNAE Nine Seed Two

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset CNAE Nine with seed equals two arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then uniformly samples classes from the unique classes in the dataset, selecting the indices where one of these classes is present. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it stratifies accordingly using train test split. The function then converts categorical columns to string and returns a dataset with the subsampled data.
