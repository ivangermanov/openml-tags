QSAR-TID-11639 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11639. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has 201 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, is a key enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is a member of the MAP kinase family, which is a group of protein kinases that are activated in response to various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and stress signals.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cell migration. It is also implicated in various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, which can be used to identify potential inhibitors or activators of the protein.
