**Diabetes Bayesian Network. Sample 2.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a comprehensive dataset for diabetes research.

This dataset consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes are moderate, indicating a complex network structure.

The dataset is characterized by a maximum in-degree, which suggests that some nodes have a high number of incoming edges.
