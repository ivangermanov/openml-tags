The Stars from Gaia DR2 and RAVE DR5 dataset combines data from the RAVE radial velocity dataset and the Gaia mission of the European Space Agency, which aims to accurately measure the position, distance, and magnitude of over a billion stars. The RAVE dataset provides spectrophotometric parallax data, as well as cross-identification of stars with a number of other datasets, including Gaia DR2.

This dataset is a combination of RAVE DR5 and Gaia DR2 sources, obtained using the query tool of the RAVE project. The SQL query selects various parameters from both datasets, including position, motion, and physical properties of the stars.

The following processing was done: removed rows with missing values in any of the selected columns; averaged values for rows that have the same Gaia source identifier.

An alternative dataset is recommended, which contains sources from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency mission Gaia, processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Funding for the consortium has been provided by national institutions.

The dataset includes features such as source identifier, right ascension, declination, proper motion, Galactic longitude, Galactic latitude, parallax, parallax error, magnitudes in different bands, metallicity, radial velocity, and distances.
