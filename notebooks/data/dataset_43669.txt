The Stars from Gaia DR2 and RAVE DR5 dataset is a combination of RAVE DR5 and Gaia DR2 sources. The data is obtained using the query tool of the RAVE project. The SQL query is designed to select specific columns from the Gaia and RAVE datasets.

This dataset is a result of a query that combines data from the RAVE DR5 and Gaia DR2 datasets. The query selects various columns from the Gaia dataset, including the source ID, right ascension, declination, parallax, parallax error, and photometric magnitudes in different bands. It also selects columns from the RAVE dataset, including the radial velocity, metallicity, distance, and various magnitudes in different bands.

The dataset is processed by removing rows with missing values in certain columns. The remaining rows are then averaged based on the Gaia source ID. This processing step ensures that the dataset only includes complete and consistent data.

The Gaia mission is a project of the European Space Agency that aims to accurately measure the position, distance, and magnitude of over a billion stars. The RAVE dataset provides radial velocity data, as well as spectrophotometric parallax data and cross-identification of stars with other datasets, including Gaia DR2.

The dataset is recommended for use in certain applications, although an alternative dataset is available that includes sources from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The dataset acknowledges the use of data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission and the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium.

Features of the dataset include source ID, right ascension, declination, proper motion, Galactic longitude and latitude, parallax, parallax error, and various photometric magnitudes.
