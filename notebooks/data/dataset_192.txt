Name: Vineyard
Tags: Dataset, Statistics, Smoothing Methods

This dataset is sourced from an unknown origin and is part of the collection found in "Smoothing Methods in Statistics." The dataset is available via FTP from the statistics department at Carnegie Mellon University. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used in research or analysis.

The dataset contains information related to vineyard production over multiple years. It includes data on the number of lugs harvested across several consecutive growing seasons. This type of longitudinal data is particularly useful for analyzing trends and patterns in agricultural output over time.

Researchers and statisticians can utilize this dataset to apply various smoothing techniques and statistical methods to understand the fluctuations in vineyard yields. Such analysis can provide insights into factors affecting grape production and help in forecasting future harvests.

The dataset's structure includes a row number for each entry and corresponding lug counts for different years, allowing for easy comparison and trend analysis across multiple growing seasons.
