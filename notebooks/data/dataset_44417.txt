Name: Higgs Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Higgs generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset. It takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes using their value counts as probabilities. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, it uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the maximum number of columns. It then selects the corresponding columns from the dataset.

Finally, if the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the dataset accordingly. It concatenates the dataset with its target variable, splits it into a subset of the desired size, and separates the features and target variable again.

The resulting dataset is then returned, along with its categorical mask and column names.
