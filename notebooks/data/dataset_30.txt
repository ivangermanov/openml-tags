Please cite: Title of Database: Blocks Classification

This dataset has been used to explore various simplification methods for decision trees. The problem involves classifying all the blocks of the page layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation process. This is a crucial step in document analysis for separating text from graphic areas. The five classes are: text, horizontal line, picture, vertical line, and graphic.

The examples come from distinct documents, with each observation concerning one block. All attributes are numeric, and the data are in a format readable by C4.5. The instances have been personally checked to ensure low noise in the data.

Relevant Information:
The examples come from distinct documents. Each observation concerns one block. All attributes are numeric. Data are in a format readable by C4.5.

Number of Instances: Multiple thousand

Attributes:
Height: integer. Height of the block.
Length: integer. Length of the block.
Area: integer. Area of the block (height * length).
Eccentricity: continuous. Eccentricity of the block (length / height).
Percentage of black pixels: continuous. Percentage of black pixels within the block.
Percentage of black pixels after RLSA: continuous. Percentage of black pixels after the application of the Run Length Smoothing Algorithm.
Mean number of white-black transitions: continuous.
Total black pixels: integer. Total number of black pixels in the original bitmap of the block.
Total black pixels after RLSA: integer. Total number of black pixels in the bitmap of the block after the RLSA.
White-black transitions: integer. Number of white-black transitions in the original bitmap of the block.

Missing Attribute Values: No missing values.

Class Distribution:
The majority class is text, followed by horizontal line, picture, vertical line, and graphic.

Summary Statistics:
Variables include height, length, area, eccentricity, percentage of black pixels, percentage of black pixels after RLSA, mean number of white-black transitions, total black pixels, total black pixels after RLSA, and white-black transitions.

The dataset is suitable for classification tasks, with the class type being nominal and the class index at the last position.
