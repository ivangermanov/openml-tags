The Image Segmentation Data Set 

The instances were drawn randomly from a database of seven outdoor images. These images were hand-segmented to create a classification for every single pixel. Each instance is a three-by-three region.

### Attribute Information 

One. Region Centroid Column: the column of the center pixel of the region.
Two. Region Centroid Row: the row of the center pixel of the region.
Three. Region Pixel Count: the number of pixels in a region equals nine.
Four. Short Line Density Five: the results of a line extraction algorithm that counts how many lines of length five (any orientation) with low contrast, less than or equal to five, go through the region.
Five. Short Line Density Two: same as Short Line Density Five but counts lines of high contrast, greater than five.
Six. Vertical Edge Mean: measures the contrast of horizontally adjacent pixels in the region. There are six; the mean and standard deviation are given. This attribute is used as a vertical edge detector.
Seven. Vertical Edge Standard Deviation: (see Six).
Eight. Horizontal Edge Mean: measures the contrast of vertically adjacent pixels. Used for horizontal line detection.
Nine. Horizontal Edge Standard Deviation: (see Eight).
Ten. Intensity Mean: the average over the region of Red plus Green plus Blue divided by three.
Eleven. Raw Red Mean: the average over the region of the Red value.
Twelve. Raw Blue Mean: the average over the region of the Blue value.
Thirteen. Raw Green Mean: the average over the region of the Green value.
Fourteen. Excess Red Mean: measures the excess red: two times Red minus Green plus Blue.
Fifteen. Excess Blue Mean: measures the excess blue: two times Blue minus Green plus Red.
Sixteen. Excess Green Mean: measures the excess green: two times Green minus Red plus Blue.
Seventeen. Value Mean: three-dimensional nonlinear transformation of Red, Green, and Blue. 
Eighteen. Saturation Mean: (see Seventeen).
Nineteen. Hue Mean: (see Seventeen).
