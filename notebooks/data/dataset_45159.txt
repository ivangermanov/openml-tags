**Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample Six.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository provides access to this network, which is characterized by its thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs. This complex system has a substantial number of parameters, totaling five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty.

On average, each node's Markov blanket consists of approximately four point five seven variables, while the average degree of the nodes is two point six three. The maximum in-degree of any node is three.

This Bayesian network was designed to model the influence diagram for management of mildew in winter wheat. It represents a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationships between various factors affecting mildew growth and development.

The network incorporates a range of variables, including microclimate factors, leaf area index, temperature, radiation, and yield. These variables interact in complex ways, influencing the likelihood of mildew occurrence and its impact on crop yields.
