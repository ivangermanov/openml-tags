**Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample 6.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a total of thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, with a staggering five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, and the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model that represents the complex relationships between various factors influencing mildew in winter wheat. It is a valuable tool for understanding and managing this important crop disease.

The network features a range of variables, including microclimate, leaf area index, fungal growth, and weather conditions, among others. These variables are interconnected, allowing for the analysis of their joint effects on mildew development.
