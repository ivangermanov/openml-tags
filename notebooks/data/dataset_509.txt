This dataset is taken from the Places Rated Almanac, copyrighted and published by Rand McNally. The data are reproduced by kind permission of the publisher, with the request that the copyright notice of Rand McNally and the names of the authors appear in any paper or presentation using these data.

The Places Rated Almanac uses nine rating criteria:
Climate and Terrain
Housing
Health Care and Environment
Crime
Transportation
Education
The Arts
Recreation
Economics

For all criteria except Housing and Crime, higher scores are better. For Housing and Crime, lower scores are better. The scores are computed using various component statistics for each criterion, as detailed in the Places Rated Almanac.

Climate and Terrain considers factors such as very hot and very cold months, seasonal temperature variation, heating and cooling degree days, freezing days, zero degree days, and ninety degree days.

Housing takes into account utility bills, property taxes, and mortgage payments.

Health Care and Environment evaluates per capita physicians, teaching hospitals, medical schools, cardiac rehabilitation centers, comprehensive cancer treatment centers, hospices, insurance and hospitalization costs index, fluoridation of drinking water, and air pollution.

Crime rates are assessed for both violent and property crimes.

Transportation examines daily commute times, public transportation availability, Interstate highways, air service, and passenger rail service.

Education looks at pupil to teacher ratios in public K-12 systems, effort index in K-12, and academic options in higher education.

The Arts category considers museums, fine arts and public radio stations, public television stations, universities offering degrees in the arts, symphony orchestras, theatres, opera companies, dance companies, and public libraries.

Recreation evaluates good restaurants, public golf courses, certified bowling lanes, movie theatres, zoos, aquariums, family theme parks, sanctioned automobile race tracks, pari-mutuel betting attractions, professional sports teams, NCAA Division I sports teams, coastline access, inland water, national forests, national parks, national wildlife refuges, and metropolitan area access.

Economics assesses average household income adjusted for taxes and living costs, income growth, and job growth.

The data are recorded in two ASCII files: PLACES.DAT and PLACES.KEY. PLACES.DAT contains observations with columns for each criterion plus an index column for location. PLACES.KEY provides the index and associated place name. Data analysis can be performed using numeric variables and the index from PLACES.DAT, or by replacing the numerical key with the alphabetic name from PLACES.KEY.
