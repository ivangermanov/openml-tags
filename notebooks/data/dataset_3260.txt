QSAR-TID-100860 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100860. The dataset has sixty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100860. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the C-C chemokine receptor type two.

The C-C chemokine receptor type two is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and cancer. The receptor is involved in the regulation of chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, which are essential for the recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for the C-C chemokine receptor type two, which can be used to predict the activity of compounds and identify potential leads for drug development.
