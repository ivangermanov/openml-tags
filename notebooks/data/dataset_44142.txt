This dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark. 

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process, from membership to rental and return, has become automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from one position and return it at another. Currently, there are over five hundred bike-sharing programs around the world, comprising more than five hundred thousand bicycles. There exists great interest in these systems due to their crucial role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health concerns.

Apart from their intriguing real-world applications, the characteristics of the data generated by these systems make them appealing for research purposes. Unlike other transportation services, such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature transforms bike sharing systems into virtual sensor networks that can be utilized for sensing mobility within cities. Consequently, it is anticipated that most significant events in the city could be detected through monitoring these data.

The bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated with environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and hour of the day can impact rental behaviors. The core dataset pertains to a two-year historical log corresponding to the years twenty eleven and twenty twelve from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., United States, which is publicly available. We aggregated the data on a two-hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information was extracted from a reliable source.

Attributes include season, year, month, hour, whether the day is a holiday or not, day of the week, whether the day is a working day, weather situation, normalized temperature in Celsius, normalized feeling temperature in Celsius, normalized humidity, normalized wind speed, count of casual users, count of registered users, and count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered users.
