Indian Liver Patient Records
Tags: Astronomy, Earth Science Context

Patients with liver disease have been continuously increasing due to the excessive consumption of alcohol, inhalation of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles, and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce the burden on doctors.

This dataset contains liver patient records and non-liver patient records collected from the North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This dataset contains male patient records and female patient records. Any patient whose age exceeded eighty-nine is listed as being of age ninety.

Columns:

* Age of the patient
* Gender of the patient
* Total Bilirubin
* Direct Bilirubin
* Alkaline Phosphatase
* Alanine Aminotransferase
* Aspartate Aminotransferase
* Total Proteins
* Albumin
* Albumin and Globulin Ratio
* Dataset: a field used to split the data into two sets (patients with liver disease or no disease)
