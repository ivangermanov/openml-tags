QSAR-TID-11188 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11188. The dataset has thirty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11188. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 11188, which is a Cytochrome P450 enzyme.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in the metabolism of various compounds, including drugs and steroids. They are involved in the breakdown of these compounds into more water-soluble forms, which can then be excreted from the body.

The dataset contains thirty-nine compounds, each with a unique Molecule ChEMBL ID and a corresponding Median PXc50 value. The Median PXc50 value represents the activity of the compound on the drug target TID: 11188.

The features of the dataset represent the molecular structure of each compound, which was generated using the FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints method. This method generates a binary vector of one thousand twenty-four bits, which represents the presence or absence of specific molecular features.

The dataset can be used for various purposes, including the development of QSAR models for predicting the activity of compounds on the drug target TID: 11188. It can also be used for the analysis of the molecular structure of compounds and their relationship with the activity on the drug target.
