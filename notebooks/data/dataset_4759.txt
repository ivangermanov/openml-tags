Porto Seguro Seed Four Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Strategically Sampled

This dataset is a strategically sampled subset of the Porto Seguro dataset, containing two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns. The sampling process was performed using a specific seed value of four to ensure reproducibility.

The Porto Seguro dataset is a well-known dataset in the life science and machine learning communities, and this strategically sampled subset aims to preserve the essential characteristics of the original dataset.

The sampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to achieve the desired number of classes, columns, and rows. The class sampling was performed using a probability distribution based on the value counts of each class, ensuring that the sampled classes are representative of the original dataset.

After selecting the classes, the corresponding rows were extracted, and then the column sampling was performed using uniform random sampling. Finally, the row sampling was done using stratified sampling to maintain the class balance.

The resulting dataset contains a mix of categorical and numerical features, including binary, categorical, and continuous variables. The features are a combination of individual, car, and calculation-related attributes.
