The QSAR-TID-30017 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30017. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it.

The data includes information about the Serine/threonine-protein kinase NEK2, also known as HSPK 21, NEK2A, and Never in mitosis A-related kinase 2. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group/other protein kinase.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including mitotic sister chromatid segregation, mitotic cell cycle, blastocyst development, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, chromosome segregation, and regulation of mitotic nuclear division. It is also associated with certain cellular components, such as chromosomes, kinetochores, condensed nuclear chromosomes, spindle poles, nuclei, nucleoplasm, cytosol, centrosomes, microtubule organizing centers, and midbodies.

Keywords: QSAR, TID, drug target, molecular fingerprints, serine/threonine-protein kinase, NEK2, biological processes, cellular components.
