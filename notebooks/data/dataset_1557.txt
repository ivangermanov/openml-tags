This dataset contains information about abalone, a type of marine mollusk. It is a modified version of the original abalone dataset, featuring three distinct classes. The data was collected by the Marine Resources Division of the Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries in Tasmania, Australia. The dataset was subsequently donated to the research community by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Tasmania. It serves as a valuable resource for studying marine biology, particularly the characteristics and classification of abalone species.
