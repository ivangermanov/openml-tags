Gas Turbine 2015

The dataset contains instances of eleven sensor measures aggregated over one hour from a gas turbine located in Turkey's northwest region, specifically designed for studying flue gas emissions, namely carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. This data comes from the same power plant as the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset, used for predicting hourly net energy yield. However, this data is collected in a different time range and includes gas turbine parameters, such as turbine inlet temperature and compressor discharge pressure, in addition to ambient variables.

Note that the dates are not provided in the instances, but the data is sorted in chronological order. For reproducibility and comparability of works, kindly follow the protocol mentioned in the paper, which uses the first three years' data for training and cross-validation, and the last two for testing.

This dataset can be well utilized for predicting turbine energy yield using ambient variables as features.
