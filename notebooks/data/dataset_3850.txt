Nashville Housing Data
Tags: Context

This dataset contains home value data for the hot Nashville real estate market. It consists of over fifty-six thousand rows of data; however, approximately half of the records are missing home detail information. If anyone is interested in tracking down the missing data, please feel free to do so. In the meantime, I will also be searching for the missing information.

This dataset offers a wealth of information, including property addresses, sale dates, sale prices, land use, legal references, and more. It also includes details on the physical characteristics of each property, such as finished area, foundation type, year built, exterior wall materials, grade levels, number of bedrooms, and bathroom counts.
