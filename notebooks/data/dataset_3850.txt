QSAR-TID-10140 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase LCK, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase LCK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase LCK is a single protein, also known as LCK, Leukocyte C-Terminal Src Kinase, LSK, Lymphocyte Cell-Specific Protein-Tyrosine Kinase, and p56-LCK. It is an enzyme, a kinase, and a protein kinase, belonging to the tyrosine protein kinase group and the Src family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset.
