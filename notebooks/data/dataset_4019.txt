QSAR-TID-12983 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12983. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 gamma, which is a protein target involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and muscle organ development.

The protein target is a single protein, also known as Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 6, and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction.

The dataset is also related to various other proteins and biological processes, including MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction.
