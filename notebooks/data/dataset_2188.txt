This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10493, and it has fifty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10493.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen.

Government, machine learning, and multi-task learning QSAR are some of the key aspects related to this dataset.
