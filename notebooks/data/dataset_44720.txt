First, it samples the classes uniformly, selecting the indices where one of the selected classes is present. Then, it samples the columns uniformly if required. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly and samples the rows.

The function returns a dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and columns.
