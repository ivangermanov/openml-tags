Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features related to polar, size, flexibility, hydrogen donor/acceptor, pi donor/acceptor, polarizability, sigma, and branch characteristics for multiple components labeled p through p. The final feature is the binary class.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original chemical or molecular dataset, focusing on triazine compounds. The binarization process applied to the target variable allows for simplified classification tasks. The features likely describe various molecular properties and interactions important for understanding triazine behavior or effects. This type of dataset could be valuable for structure-activity relationship studies or predictive modeling in fields such as medicinal chemistry or environmental science.
