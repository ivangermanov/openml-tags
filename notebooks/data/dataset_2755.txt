This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex USD/CAD exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one trading day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active on these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean close price of the following day relative to the mean close price of the current day. Specifically, if the mean close price is expected to increase the following day, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.
