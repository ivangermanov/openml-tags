QSAR-TID-17085 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17085. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calpain 2, also known as Calcium-activated Neutral Proteinase 2, Calpain-2 Catalytic Subunit, Calpain-2 Large Subunit, Calpain M-type, and CANP 2. The target is an enzyme, a protease, and a cysteine protease, belonging to the Cysteine Protease CA Clan and Cysteine Protease C2 Family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam, and contains information on the target's function, process, and component. The target is involved in proteolysis and cellular response to amino acid stimulus, and has calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.
