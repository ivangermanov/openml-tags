QSAR-TID-17085 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: seventeen thousand eighty-five, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information about calpain two, also known as calcium-activated neutral proteinase two, calpain-two catalytic subunit, calpain-two large subunit, calpain M-type, CANP two, and other synonyms. It is an enzyme/protease/cysteine protease/cysteine protease CA clan/cysteine protease C2 family.

The description of this protein target classification includes relationships and accession information, specifically calpain-two catalytic subunit as a single protein with accession P four three three six seven.

The dataset also provides component information, including gene ontology terms such as cytoplasm, plasma membrane, membrane, and dendrite. Additionally, it includes function information, including gene ontology terms such as calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.

Furthermore, the dataset provides process information, including gene ontology terms such as proteolysis and cellular response to amino acid stimulus. It also includes canSAR-target information, UniProt information, InterPro information, and Pfam information.
