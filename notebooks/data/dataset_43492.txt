Every year, Kaggle conducts an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. This dataset, Kaggle Survey 2017-2020 Merged Data, combines the data from the past four years, providing a rich and detailed understanding of the trends and developments in the field.

The data was acquired and cleaned by the Kaggle team, and then merged using a notebook. This merged dataset offers a unique opportunity to analyze and compare the responses over the years, identifying patterns, shifts, and correlations that can inform business decisions, research, and professional development.

The dataset features a range of variables, including the respondent's age, gender, country of origin, educational background, job title, company size, team size, the status of machine learning in their company, compensation status, and money spent on data science and machine learning initiatives.
