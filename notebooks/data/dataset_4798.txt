QSAR TID 11 Tags:

**Data Description**
This dataset contains drugs and their potency. The features of the drug are Fingerprint Molecular Descriptors, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

**Attribute Description**
The Median PXc50 is the target feature, representing the median potency of the drug.
The Molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule.

The dataset includes various fingerprint descriptors, including Fragment-Based Circular Fingerprints, which provide a compact representation of the molecular structure.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular descriptors, fingerprint, potency, Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification.
