Past Usage:
This data was used for understanding the human estimator, specifically in the context of software project estimation. Since its initial use, the data set has expanded by about fifty percent, allowing for more detailed analysis and categorization of participants into three groups: severe underestimators, accurate estimators, and severe overestimators.

Number of Attributes:
Attribute Information:

The attributes include various measures of the participants' educational background, technical and management coursework, workshop and conference attendance, language experience, project management experience, and industry-specific experience. These attributes are used to assess the reliability of the human estimator in software project estimation.

Attribute Information:

* Degree: This attribute refers to the level of education of the participant.
* Technical Undergraduate Courses: This refers to the number of technical undergraduate courses that the participant has taken.
* Technical Graduate Courses: This refers to the number of technical graduate courses that the participant has taken.
* Management Undergraduate Courses: This refers to the number of management undergraduate courses that the participant has taken.
* Management Graduate Courses: This refers to the number of management graduate courses that the participant has taken.
* Total Workshops: This refers to the total number of workshops that the participant has attended.
* Total Conferences: This refers to the total number of conferences that the participant has attended.
* Total Language Experience: This refers to the total number of languages and experience in those languages that the participant has.
* Hardware Project Management Experience: This corresponds to the total amount of time that the respondent has been estimating hardware projects.
* Software Project Management Experience: This corresponds to the total amount of time that the respondent has been estimating software projects.
* Number of Hardware Projects Estimated: This refers to the total number of hardware projects that the participant has estimated.
* Number of Software Projects Estimated: This refers to the total number of software projects that the participant has estimated.
* Domain Experience: The domain experience refers to how much experience the participant has in the oil and gas industry.
* Procurement Industry Experience: The procurement industry experience refers to the amount of time, in years, that the participant has regarding procurement.

Class Variable:
The class variable represents the overall relative error for the participant's estimates.
