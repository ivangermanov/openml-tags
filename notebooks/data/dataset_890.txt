Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Period, Seeded, Temperature, Wind, Cloud Cover, Precipitation

This dataset, known as Cloud, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified two-class classification problem. The process involved calculating the mean of the target variable and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean were labeled as positive, while those above were designated as negative. This transformation allows for binary classification tasks and potentially simplifies analysis.

The dataset includes various meteorological features such as time period, whether cloud seeding occurred, temperature, wind conditions, cloud cover, and precipitation. These attributes provide a comprehensive view of atmospheric conditions, which could be valuable for weather prediction or climate studies.

Researchers and data scientists interested in working with this binarized version should ensure they cite it appropriately, acknowledging the modifications made to the original dataset. The binary classification approach may be particularly useful for machine learning applications or statistical analyses that require discrete outcomes.
