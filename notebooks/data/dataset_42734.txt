OkCupid Stem Dataset 

Demographics, Economics

User profile data for San Francisco OkCupid users published in a research paper is available for analysis. This curated dataset was downloaded from a GitHub repository. The original dataset was created using a Python script that extracted data from public profiles on OkCupid website on a specific date. It includes individuals within a twenty-five-mile radius of San Francisco who were online in the previous year, with at least one profile picture.

Permission to use this data was obtained under the condition that the dataset remains publicly accessible. As the target variable, the job category was collapsed into three groups: stem, non-stem, and student. STEM jobs were defined as computer hardware software, science tech engineering. Observations with unemployed, retired, rather not say or missing values in job were removed.

The original dataset also included open-text variables, which were removed from the uploaded dataset. The dataset further includes a date-time variable, last online, which could be used to construct additional features. Using OkCupid data for predicting STEM jobs was inspired by a book on feature engineering and selection for predictive models.

Features include age, body type, diet, drinks, drug use, education level, ethnicity, height, income, job title, location, offspring, sexual orientation, pet ownership, religious beliefs, gender, zodiac sign, smoking habits, languages spoken, and relationship status.
