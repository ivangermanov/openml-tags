This dataset contains sixty-four emails collected from the DB World newsletter. The emails were used to train different algorithms in order to classify between announcements of conferences and everything else. A binary bag-of-words representation was employed with a stop-word removal preprocessing task performed beforehand.

Each attribute in the dataset corresponds to a specific word or stem in the entire dataset vocabulary, which was achieved through the use of a bag-of-words representation.

The dataset was created for the purpose of email classification using a very small corpus. The relevant paper on this topic provides further information on the project, which was part of a machine learning course.
