Dataset: DBWorld emails data set
Task: DBWorld bodies

Source: UCI

Data Set Information:
This dataset consists of emails collected from the DBWorld newsletter. The emails were used to train various algorithms for classifying between "announces of conferences" and "everything else". A binary bag of words representation was employed, with a stopword removal preprocessing step applied beforehand.

Attribute Information:
Each attribute corresponds to a specific word or stem in the entire dataset vocabulary, utilizing a bag of words representation.

Relevant Papers:
"DBWorld email classification using a very small corpus", Project of Machine Learning course, University of Manchester.

Features:
The dataset includes numerous features labeled V through V, representing various words or stems from the email corpus vocabulary. Due to the large number of features, they are not individually listed here.

Additional Information:
The dataset was created to explore email classification techniques using a limited corpus size. It demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to natural language processing tasks, specifically in the domain of academic conference announcements and related communications.
