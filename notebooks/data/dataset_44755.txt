Subsampling of the dataset Riccardo with seed equals two, maximum number of rows equals two thousand, maximum number of columns equals one hundred, maximum number of classes equals ten, and stratify equals True.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters such as seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the unique classes present in the dataset. If the number of unique classes is more than the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset.

Next, it selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. Then, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is more than the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns randomly.

After that, it stratifies the data accordingly if the number of rows is more than the maximum number of rows. It uses the train test split function from scikit learn to achieve this.

Finally, it returns a dataset with the filtered data, categorical mask, and column names.

Keywords: dataset subsampling, stratified sampling, column selection, class selection, data filtering.
