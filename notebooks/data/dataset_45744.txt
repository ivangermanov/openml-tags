The Cookbook Reviews dataset is an extensive collection of information that encompasses a wide range of user interactions and recipe reviews. This dataset contains crucial details such as the recipe name, its ranking in the list of top recipes, a unique recipe code, and user information including the user identification, username, and internal reputation rating. Each review comment is accompanied by a unique comment identification and other attributes, including the creation timestamp, response count, and the total number of upvotes and downvotes. Users' opinions of recipes are rated on a five-star rating system, with no rating at all represented by zero.

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of user opinions and interactions, allowing for in-depth analysis of recipe popularity and user behavior. The inclusion of user reputation ratings and comment responses enables the examination of social dynamics and influence within the community. The five-star rating system provides a clear and concise method for users to express their opinions, while the upvote and downvote counts offer additional insight into the community's sentiment towards each recipe.
