Airlines Seed Three Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the original airlines dataset, generated with a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed ten. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, retaining only the instances that belonged to these classes.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled, reducing the number of columns to one hundred. The selection of columns was done randomly, but the resulting columns were sorted in ascending order to maintain consistency.

Finally, the number of rows was reduced to two thousand, using stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution was preserved. This was achieved by concatenating the data and target variables, and then applying the train-test split function with stratification.

The resulting dataset consists of the airline, flight, airport from, airport to, day of week, time, length, and delay features. These features are retained from the original dataset, with the categorical columns converted to string format for compatibility with OpenML.
