The Curated Microarray Database, also known as CuMiDa, is a repository containing seventy-eight handpicked cancer microarray datasets, extensively curated from thirty thousand studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus, solely for machine learning. The aim of CuMiDa is to offer homogeneous and state-of-the-art biological preprocessing of these datasets, together with numerous three-fold cross-validation benchmark results to propel machine learning studies focused on cancer research. The database makes available various download options to be employed by other programs, as well as for Principal Component Analysis and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding results.

CuMiDa stands different from existing databases for offering newer datasets, manually and carefully curated, from samples quality, unwanted probes, background correction, and normalization, to create a more reliable source of data for computational research.

The dataset GSE50161 on brain cancer gene expression from CuMiDa consists of five classes, fifty-six thousand seven hundred seventy-six genes, and one hundred thirty samples.

This dataset raises several questions, such as how to deal with class imbalance for classification, how to identify the most important genes for the classification of each cancer subtype, and whether it is possible to discover subtypes. Additionally, it challenges researchers to beat the classification and clustering benchmarks for this dataset listed on the CuMiDa website.
