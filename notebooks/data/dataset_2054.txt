The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11407. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains information about the drug target TID: 11407, also known as c-Jun N-terminal kinase two. This enzyme is involved in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and gene expression.

The dataset provides information about the inhibitory activity of different compounds against this enzyme, which could be useful for the development of new therapeutic agents.
