Pollution Dataset

Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes various features that contribute to pollution, including precipitation, January temperature, July temperature, percentage of population over sixty five years old, population size, education level, housing conditions, density, non-white population, working women, poverty rate, health care facilities, nitrogen oxide levels, sulfur dioxide levels, and humidity.
