Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Vineyard, is associated with various studies and mythbusting efforts. The original source and date of creation are unknown. It is important to note that this version is a binarized adaptation of an earlier dataset. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification system. This was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P'), while those above were labeled as negative ('N').

The dataset includes several features that provide information about vineyard-related data points. These features encompass temporal aspects, spatial organization, and grouping criteria. The binary classification serves as the target variable for analysis or predictive modeling purposes.

Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset are encouraged to properly cite it in their work, acknowledging its binarized nature and the modifications made to the original version.
