The Meta Album Insects two Micro dataset is a subset of the larger Insect Pest Recognition dataset, containing over seventy-five thousand images across one hundred two categories. The images have been preprocessed to create perfect square crops, resized to one twenty-eight by one twenty-eight pixels.
