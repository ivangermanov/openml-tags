Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample Seven.

The Alarm Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, indicating its complexity. Specifically, it comprises thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in five hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, while the average degree is two point four nine. Furthermore, the maximum in-degree is four.

This network was originally presented in a case study that explored two probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. The study demonstrated the application of the Alarm monitoring system in a medical setting.

Some of the notable features of this network include Disconnect, Insufficient Anesthesia, Pulmonary Artery Pressure, History, Arterial Carbon Dioxide, Error Caused by Under Read, Heart Rate Blood Pressure, Press, Fraction of Inspired Oxygen, Blood Pressure, Ventilator Machine, Ventilator Tube, Catecholamine, Cardiac Output, Intubation, Error Low Output, Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure, Minimum Volume Set, Total Peripheral Resistance, Central Venous Pressure, Ventilator Lung, Anaphylaxis, Pulse Oximeter Saturation, Minimum Volume, Expected Carbon Dioxide, Heart Rate Saturation, Left Ventricular Failure, Hypovolemia, Heart Rate Electrocardiogram, Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume, Arterial Oxygen Saturation, Pulmonary Embolus, Heart Rate, Ventilator Alveolar, Stroke Volume, Kinked Tube, and Shunt.
