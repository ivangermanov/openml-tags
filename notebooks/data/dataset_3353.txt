QSAR-TID-12666 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12666. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains several compounds with their corresponding activity values, which can be used to train machine learning models to predict the activity of new compounds. The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor that can capture the structural information of molecules.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of cheminformatics and drug discovery.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including virtual screening, lead optimization, and ADMET prediction. The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints can be used as input features for machine learning models, which can be trained to predict the activity of new compounds.
