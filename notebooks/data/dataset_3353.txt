The dataset QSAR-TID-12666 contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12666. It has multiple rows and features, including molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains information about the Serine-Threonine-Protein Kinase AKT, also known as Protein Kinase B, which is an enzyme that plays a key role in various cellular processes such as cell survival, metabolism, and proliferation.

The AKT protein is a key player in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is activated in response to various stimuli, including growth factors and hormones. The pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and diabetes.

The dataset includes features such as molecular descriptors, pharmacophore points, and biological activity data, which can be used to develop predictive models of AKT inhibition. The dataset can be used to identify potential inhibitors of AKT, which could be useful for the treatment of diseases related to AKT dysregulation.

Keywords: QSAR, AKT, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, protein kinase, cell survival, metabolism, proliferation, cancer, diabetes, molecular descriptors, pharmacophore points, biological activity data.
