QSAR-TID-11169 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11169. The dataset has fifty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor. This receptor is a single protein, also known as Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor, GRP-preferring Bombesin Receptor, and Grpr. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway.

The receptor is primarily found in the plasma membrane and is involved in various cellular components, including the plasma membrane and membrane. It has various molecular functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, bombesin receptor activity, protein binding, and neuropeptide receptor activity. The receptor is also involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway.
