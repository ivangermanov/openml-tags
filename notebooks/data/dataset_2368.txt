Data from Training Set of the Loan Default Prediction Challenge 

This dataset corresponds to a set of financial transactions associated with individuals. The data has been standardized, de trended, and anonymized. You are provided with a large number of observations and numerous features. Each observation is independent from the previous one. For each observation, it was recorded whether a default was triggered. In case of a default, the loss was measured. This quantity lies between zero and one hundred. It has been normalized, considering that the notional of each transaction at inception is one hundred. For example, a loss of sixty means that only forty is reimbursed. If the loan did not default, the loss was zero.

You are asked to predict the losses for each observation in the test set. Missing feature values have been kept as is, so that the competing teams can really use the maximum data available, implementing a strategy to fill the gaps if desired. Note that some variables may be categorical. The competition sponsor has worked to remove time dimensionality from the data. However, the observations are still listed in order from old to new.

The dataset includes various features, including identification information and numerous financial metrics.
