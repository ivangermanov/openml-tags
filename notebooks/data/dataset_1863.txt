This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID ninety-nine. It has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID ninety-nine.

The features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PX fifty. The fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to life science, machine learning, and MTL QSAR.

QSAR-TID-ninety-nine is a single protein preferred name for follicle stimulating hormone receptor. It has synonyms such as follitropin receptor, FSHR, FSH-R, and LGR one.
