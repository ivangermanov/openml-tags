Eye Movements Dataset

This dataset belongs to the "classification on categorical and numerical features" benchmark. It is a straight-forward classification task, where pre-computed feature vectors for each word in the eye movement trajectory are provided, along with class labels.

The dataset consists of several assignments, each consisting of a question followed by ten sentences (titles of news articles). One of the sentences is the correct answer to the question, five of the sentences are irrelevant to the question, and four of the sentences are relevant to the question but do not answer it.

Each assignment is a time sequence of twenty-two-dimensional feature vectors. The first column is the line number, the second column is the assignment number, and the next twenty-two columns are the different features. Columns twenty-five to twenty-seven contain extra information about the example. The training data set contains the classification label in the twenty-eighth column: "irrelevant", "relevant", or "correct answer".

Each example represents a single word, and the task is to return the classification of each read sentence. The twenty-two features provided are commonly used in psychological studies on eye movement, but not all of them are necessarily relevant in this context. The objective is to predict the classification labels.

The features include the number of fixations to the word, the number of fixations to the word when it is first encountered, whether fixation occurred when the sentence the word was in was encountered the first or second time, the duration of previous fixation, the duration of the first fixation when the word is first encountered, and many others.
