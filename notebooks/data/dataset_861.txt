Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Manufacturer, Type, City MPG, Highway MPG, Air Bags standard, Drive train type, Number of cylinders, Engine size, Horsepower, RPM, Engine revolutions per mile, Manual transmission available, Fuel tank capacity, Passenger capacity, Length, Wheelbase, Width, U turn space, Rear seat room, Luggage capacity, Weight, Domestic, binary Class

This dataset contains information about various automobile characteristics and performance metrics. It has been binarized from its original form, transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification. The classification is based on the mean value, with instances below the mean labeled as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This modification allows for binary classification tasks and studies.

The dataset includes a wide range of features related to vehicle specifications, such as fuel efficiency, engine characteristics, physical dimensions, and passenger accommodations. These attributes provide a comprehensive view of each automobile in the dataset, enabling various analyses and comparisons across different makes and models.

The inclusion of both technical specifications and consumer-oriented features makes this dataset valuable for studies in automotive engineering, market analysis, and consumer behavior research. The binary classification aspect adds an additional dimension for machine learning and statistical analysis projects.
