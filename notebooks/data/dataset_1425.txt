MetaQSAR project Dataset: QSAR-TID-20157 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20157. It has sixty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20157. The features are molecular fingerprints, specifically Fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, a software tool used for generating molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a large-scale QSAR modeling project aimed at predicting the activities of small molecules against a wide range of biological targets. The project involves the use of machine learning algorithms and multi-task learning techniques to predict the activities of small molecules against multiple targets simultaneously.

The dataset is publicly available and can be cited as part of the MetaQSAR project. It is intended for use in machine learning and QSAR modeling applications, and can be used to train and test machine learning models for predicting the activities of small molecules against drug target TID: 20157.
