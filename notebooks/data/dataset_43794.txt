This dataset, named Tweets with Keyword Lockdown in April July 2020, is categorized under Life Science and Medicine. It was created for an academic project focused on sentiment analysis of tweets during the lockdown period.

The tweets were collected using the Get Old Tweets Three Python three library, which pulled the tweets from Twitter. The dataset consists of tweets posted between April First and August First, which coincides with the peak lockdown period in India.

The collected tweets underwent minimal cleaning, where duplicates and NaN values were removed. As a result, the dataset contains a total of tweets without any further processing.

The dataset has several columns, including the text of the tweet, the date and time it was posted, the number of retweets, favorites, mentions, and hashtags.

Notably, the Top Tweets feature was disabled during the scraping process. This dataset offers numerous opportunities for data exploration, including data cleaning, text preprocessing, association rule mining, and sentiment analysis.

Features include Text, Date, Retweets, Favorites, Mentions, and HashTags.
