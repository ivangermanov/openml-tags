Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Context:
This dataset collects data daily from Our World in Data's GitHub repository for COVID-19, merges, and uploads it.

Content:
The data provides the following information:

* Country: This refers to the country for which the vaccination information is provided.
* Country ISO Code: This is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) code for the country.
* Date: This is the date for the data entry, which may include either daily vaccinations or cumulative totals.
* Total Number of Vaccinations: This represents the absolute number of total immunizations in the country.
* Total Number of People Vaccinated: A person may receive one or multiple vaccines, depending on the immunization scheme, so the number of vaccinations might be higher than the number of people vaccinated at a given point in time.
* Total Number of People Fully Vaccinated: This indicates the number of people who have received the entire set of immunizations according to the immunization scheme, which typically involves two doses. At any given point in time, there may be a certain number of people who have received one dose and a smaller number who have received both doses.
* Daily Vaccinations (Raw): For a specific data entry, this represents the number of vaccinations administered on that particular date in the specified country.
* Daily Vaccinations: Similar to the previous field, this shows the number of vaccinations administered on a particular date in the specified country.
* Total Vaccinations per Hundred: This ratio expresses the percentage of the total population in the country that has been vaccinated up to the specified date.
* Total Number of People Vaccinated per Hundred: This ratio expresses the percentage of the total population in the country that has been immunized up to the specified date.
* Total Number of People Fully Vaccinated per Hundred: This ratio expresses the percentage of the total population in the country that has been fully immunized up to the specified date.
* Number of Vaccinations per Day: This represents the number of daily vaccinations administered in the specified country on a particular date.
* Daily Vaccinations per Million: This ratio expresses the number of vaccinations administered per million people in the country on a particular date.
* Vaccines Used in the Country: This indicates the total number of vaccines used in the country up to the specified date.
* Source Name: This refers to the source of the information, which could be a national authority, international organization, or local organization, among others.
* Source Website: This is the website of the source providing the information.
