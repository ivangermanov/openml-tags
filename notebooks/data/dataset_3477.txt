QSAR-TID-101602 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101602. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101602. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The target protein is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase LATS2, which is a single protein target. It is also known as Kinase Phosphorylated During Mitosis Protein KPM, Large Tumor Suppressor Homolog 2, and Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase KPM. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, and Reactome. The data includes information on the protein target, such as its synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The dataset also includes information on the protein's expression, function, and process, as well as its relationships with other proteins and molecules.
