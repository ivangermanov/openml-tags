Name: Churn Seed One Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Churn dataset with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes from the unique values in the target variable y. If the number of unique classes exceeds nclasses max, it selects the top nclasses max classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds ncols max, it randomly selects ncols max columns and subsets the data. Otherwise, it uses all columns.

Finally, if the number of rows exceeds nrows max, it stratifies the data accordingly using the target variable and subsets the data to the desired number of rows.
