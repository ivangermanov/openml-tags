QSAR-TID-10930 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10930. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Vasopressin V2 receptor, which is a single protein target. The Vasopressin V2 receptor is also known as the Antidiuretic hormone receptor, Avpr two, and Renal-type arginine vasopressin receptor. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, signal transduction, and cell population proliferation.

The Vasopressin V2 receptor is expressed in the endosome, plasma membrane, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm. It has G protein-coupled receptor activity, vasopressin receptor activity, peptide hormone binding, and peptide binding.

The dataset is also related to various biological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, signal transduction, and cell population proliferation. It is also related to various diseases, including hypertension and diabetes insipidus.
