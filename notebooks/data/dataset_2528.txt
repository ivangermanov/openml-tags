This ChaLearn Automatic Machine Learning Challenge, also known as AutoML, is a supervised learning competition in machine learning. Thirty datasets are made available, each pre-formatted in a given feature representation, meaning every example consists of a fixed number of numerical coefficients. The challenge is to solve classification and regression problems without any further human intervention.

The difficulty lies in the broad diversity of data types and distributions, including balanced or unbalanced classes, sparse or dense feature representations, with or without missing values or categorical variables, various metrics of evaluation, and varying proportions of the number of features and examples. The problems are drawn from a wide range of domains, including medical diagnosis from laboratory analyses, speech recognition, credit rating, prediction of drug toxicity or efficacy, classification of text, prediction of customer satisfaction, object recognition, protein structure prediction, action recognition in video data, and many others.

While existing machine learning toolkits contain methods capable of solving all these problems, it still requires considerable human effort to find the optimal combination of methods and hyperparameter settings for a given dataset, task, metric of evaluation, and available computational time. Therefore, the goal is to create the perfect black box, eliminating the need for human intervention.

This challenge involves code submission, where the submitted code will be executed automatically on the challenge servers to train and test the learning machines with unknown datasets. However, participants are not obligated to submit code; half of the prizes can be won by simply submitting prediction results.

The challenge consists of six rounds, each introducing progressively difficult datasets. Participants can enter any round without prerequisites, and the rounds alternate between AutoML phases, where submitted code is blind-tested in limited time on the challenge platform using unseen datasets, and Tweakathon phases, allowing participants to improve their methods by tweaking them on those datasets and running them on their own systems without computational resource limitations.
