This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred eighteen zero, and it has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically study three, and was published in September two thousand fifteen.

The target protein is serine threonine protein kinase thirty-two C, also known as PKE, STK thirty-two C, and YANK three, yet another novel kinase three. It belongs to the AGC protein kinase group, specifically the AGC protein kinase YANK family.
