Tags: Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark 

This dataset belongs to the Regression on Numerical Features benchmark. 

The dataset was designed based on data provided by the United States Census Bureau, which was collected as part of the nineteen ninety US census. These data are mostly counts cumulated at different survey levels. For the purpose of this dataset, a level of State Place was used, and data from all states was obtained. Most of the counts were changed into appropriate proportions. 

There are four different datasets obtained from this database, all concerned with predicting the median price of the house in the region based on demographic composition and the state of the housing market in the region. 

This dataset is one of the four, characterized by having seventeen continuous attributes. It is a challenging task due to the lower correlation of the inputs to the target.
