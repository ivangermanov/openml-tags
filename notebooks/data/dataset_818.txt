Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: column one, column two, column three, column four, column five, column six, column seven, column eight, binary class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with values below the mean are classified as positive, while those above or equal to the mean are classified as negative. This binarization process simplifies the original data into a two-class problem, which can be useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks. The dataset contains multiple columns of information, with the final column representing the binary classification outcome.
