QSAR-TID-103453 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Thirteen, and it has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty. The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints.
