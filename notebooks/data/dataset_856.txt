The Vowel Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

Features include whether the sample is part of the Training Set or the Testing Set, the Speaker's Identification Number, the Speaker's Gender, and various other characteristics of the vowels being studied. The ultimate goal is to classify these vowels based on their characteristics into Positive or Negative categories.
