Tags: Life Science, Physical Sciences 

This dataset is part of the regression on numerical features benchmark and was transformed in the same way as the original dataset used in the tabular data benchmark.

The Miami Housing 2016 dataset contains information on single-family homes sold in Miami. It includes publicly available information along with added distance variables, aviation noise, and latitude and longitude. 

This comprehensive dataset consists of several columns, including a unique identifier for each property, sale price, land area, floor area, value of special features, distances to various locations such as rail lines, oceans, bodies of water, central business districts, subcenters, highways, age of the structure, airplane noise levels, structure quality, and sale month.

A typical model using this dataset would aim to predict the logarithm of the sale price based on all variables except the parcel number.

Features include geographic coordinates, land and floor areas, values of special features, distances to various locations, age, sale month, and sale price.
