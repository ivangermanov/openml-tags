This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Adenosine A2b Receptor, and it has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Adenosine A2b Receptor. The dataset has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

Adenosine A2b Receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as Adenosine Receptor A2b or Adora two b. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus and is classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor small molecule receptor family A GPCR nucleotide like receptor family A GPCR adenosine receptor.

It is described as being involved in various biological processes such as positive regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, G protein coupled adenosine receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of chronic inflammatory response to non antigenic stimulus, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase activating G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, and many others.

It is also involved in various cellular components such as plasma membrane, cell surface, membrane, synapse, Schaffer collateral CA one synapse, presynapse, glutamatergic synapse, and cellular anatomical entity.
