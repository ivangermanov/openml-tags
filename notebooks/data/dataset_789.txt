The Arsenic Female Bladder dataset is a binarized regression problem related to chemistry and life science. This dataset is part of several studies, including Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, and Study Seven.

This dataset has undergone a transformation where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'.

The dataset features include Group, Concentration, Age, and At Risk, which have been categorized accordingly based on their values.
