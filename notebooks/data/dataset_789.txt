Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This binarization technique simplifies the original numeric target into a more straightforward two-class problem, potentially making it more suitable for certain machine learning algorithms or analysis techniques. The dataset retains its original features, now complemented by the new binary classification target.
