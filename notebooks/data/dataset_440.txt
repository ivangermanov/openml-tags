This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies include research on carbolenes, melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, QSAR analysis, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity relationships, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro- and bromo-alkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, purposely modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The datasets cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, including melting points, toxicity, biodegradability, enzyme activity, protein stability, and drug efficacy. Various computational methods are employed, such as artificial neural networks, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), and multivariate pattern recognition.

These studies contribute to the fields of medicinal chemistry, environmental science, and computational biology by providing insights into the relationships between molecular structure and various properties or activities of chemical compounds.
