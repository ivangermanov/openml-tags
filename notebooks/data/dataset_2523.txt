The goal of this challenge is to expose the research community to real-world datasets of interest to Four Paradigm, thereby facilitating innovative solutions to practical problems. All datasets are formatted uniformly, despite differences in their underlying nature. To facilitate focused exploration, the data are provided as preprocessed matrices, allowing participants to concentrate on classification tasks, although they are free to employ additional feature extraction procedures as needed.

All problems presented are binary classification challenges, and their performance will be assessed using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) metric. The identities of the datasets and the types of data remain concealed, but their structural details are revealed. The final score in Phase Two will be calculated as the average of rankings across all testing datasets, with winners determined based on these rankings.

To ensure fair evaluation, each code submission will be executed within a compute worker featuring two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, and a forty-gigabyte solid-state drive running an Ubuntu operating system. Furthermore, execution time for each submission is limited to prevent excessive resource consumption.

The ChaLearn Study Two Eighteen dataset features a comprehensive set of variables, including Class, along with numerous other attributes.
