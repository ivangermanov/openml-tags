This dataset contains historical price data of the Australian Dollar/Swiss Franc (AUD/CHF) currency pair from Dukascopy. Each row represents a single hourly candlestick, with a total data range spanning from January to December.

The dataset excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these periods. All timestamps are recorded in the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price over the subsequent hour, relative to the current hourly mean high price. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean high price increases over the next hour, and false if it decreases or remains unchanged.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used to inform real-world trading decisions. In practice, realistic trade strategies should be based on predictions of closing prices, which are also available in this dataset.
