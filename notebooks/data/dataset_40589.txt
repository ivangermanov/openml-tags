The Emotions dataset is a multi-label audio dataset consisting of 593 musical files, each of which can be labeled with one or more of six emotional categories: Amazed-Surprised, Happy-Pleased, Relaxing-Calm, Quiet-Still, Sad-Lonely, and Angry-Aggressive.

This dataset contains seventy-two predictors, including various acoustic features such as mean and standard deviation of centroid, rolloff, flux, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. 

The Emotions dataset is particularly useful for machine learning tasks involving emotion recognition and classification, where the goal is to predict the emotional labels associated with a given piece of music based on its acoustic characteristics.
