Emotions Dataset

This multi-label dataset consists of 593 musical files with six clustered emotional labels and numerous predictors. Each song can be labeled with one or more of the following emotions: amazed and surprised, happy and pleased, relaxing and calm, quiet and still, sad and lonely, and angry and aggressive.

The dataset features a range of audio characteristics, including mean and standard deviation values for various acoustic features such as centroid, rolloff, flux, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Additionally, the dataset includes features related to beat histogram statistics, including low peak amplitude, high peak amplitude, high-low ratio, and sum values.

The emotions dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on music information retrieval and affective computing applications.
