**QSAR-TID-10472**
Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10472, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fingerprint features, and median pxc fifty.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was published in September 2015. 

Scraped Data:
