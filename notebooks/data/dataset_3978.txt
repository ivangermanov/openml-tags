QSAR-TID-10472 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10472. The dataset has 455 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Cholecystokinin A receptor as a drug target.

Scraped Data:

The Cholecystokinin A receptor is a single protein target, also known as CCK1-R, CCKAR, CCK-AR, CCK-A receptor, and CCKRA. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes.

The receptor is expressed in the Homo sapiens species and is classified as a peptide receptor. It has been implicated in various diseases and disorders, including gastrointestinal disorders and cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Cholecystokinin A receptor.
