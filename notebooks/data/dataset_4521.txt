Name: Ozone Level Eight Hour Seed One 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Ozone Level Eight Hour 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Ozone Level Eight Hour dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of one, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, a maximum number of classes of ten, and stratification set to false.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the classes were uniformly sampled to select a subset of ten classes from the total number of unique classes. The indices where these classes were present were then selected, and the corresponding data points were retained. Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to select a subset of one hundred columns from the total number of columns. The selected columns were then retained.

Finally, the data points were stratified according to the target variable, and a subset of two thousand data points was randomly selected while maintaining the class balance.
