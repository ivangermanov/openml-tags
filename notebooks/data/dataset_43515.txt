Egg Producing Chickens Dataset

Tags: Context

This dataset could be used without permission for purposes of enhancing machine learning and data science. It can easily be adapted for classification, regression, and clustering. At a practical level, such machine learning could be applied to determine which chickens are due for culling or approximating the number of eggs to be harvested.

Content

The dataset includes information about the breed of chicken, such as Buff Orpington chicken, the day on which an observation was made, the age of the chicken in weeks, the weight of the chicken in grams, the color of the eggs, the weight of the eggs in grams, the amount of feed in grams the chicken consumed per day, the number of eggs a chicken laid on a particular day, the comb type of a particular chicken, the number of hours a chicken is exposed to natural light in a day, the chicken classes as classified by international poultry associations, the color of the legs and feet and shanks on them, the color of the chicken's beak, the color of the chicken earlobes, and the color of the feathers.

Acknowledgements

The dataset draws inspiration from various online resources, including websites about chicken breeds and egg-laying capabilities.

Inspiration

The creation of this dataset is driven by a passion for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The lack of active participation from the African continent in these fields is a challenge that needs to be addressed. By contributing this dataset, it is hoped that it will add to the African contribution to the broader data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence ecosystem.
