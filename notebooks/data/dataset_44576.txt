Subsampling of the dataset Arcene with seed equal to three arguments number rows max equal to two thousand arguments number columns max equal to one hundred arguments number classes max equal to ten arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters including self, seed, number rows max, number columns max, number classes max, and stratified. It returns a dataset.

Uniformly sampling classes, the function first gets the unique values from the target variable y. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed number of classes, it selects a specified number of classes using probability proportional to their frequency in the data.

Next, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed number of columns, it randomly selects a specified number of columns.

Then, it uniformly samples rows. If the total number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a specified number of rows based on the class distribution.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to strings and returns a new dataset with the sampled data.

Features include various variables such as fifteen, forty-eight, three hundred three, and many others.
