Andes Bayesian Network. Sample 1.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, with a significant number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is moderate, and the average degree is relatively low. The maximum in-degree is also moderate.

The Andes Bayesian Network is a model for online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks.

Features of this network include nodes related to problem solving, such as choosing and resolving problems, identifying and applying concepts, and setting goals. There are also nodes related to physics concepts, such as force, gravity, and kinematics.

Keywords: Bayesian network, student modeling, problem solving, physics concepts.
