The QSAR-TID-100579 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor Two, also known as GPR109A, G-Protein Coupled Receptor 109A, G-Protein Coupled Receptor HM74A, HCA Two, and HCAR Two.

This dataset has five hundred sixty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains information about the Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor Two, which is a single protein preferred name, and its synonyms. It is classified under the family A G-protein coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, carboxylic acid receptor, and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor.

The dataset also includes information about the expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process related to the Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor Two. Additionally, it provides information about canSAR-target, guide to pharmacology, pharmGKB, pharos, reactome, uniprot, interpro, and pfam related to this receptor.
