Binarized version of the California Housing Dataset

This dataset was obtained from Luis Torgo's collection of regression datasets. It was binarized to serve as the original, unprocessed data for the California Housing dataset.

The dataset was originally sourced from the StatLib repository. The description of the dataset is as follows:

We collected information on various variables using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. In this sample, a block group on average includes individuals living in a geographically compact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. We computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. We excluded all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables.

The final data contained observations on nine variables. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of median house value.

The file contains all the variables, specifically including median house value, median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude in that order.
