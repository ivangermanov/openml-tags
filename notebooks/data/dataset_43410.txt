Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)

Since awareness on COVID-19 began growing across the world, more health datasets have been published as open for re-users to utilize in creating platforms and interactive maps, for example, to support citizens in taking steps to stay healthy, like avoiding risk areas, and to provide valuable insights into the spread of the disease. This dataset is intended to mobilize researchers to apply recent advances in natural language processing to generate new insights in support of the fight against this infectious disease, and to explore the various factors that contribute to its spread and impact.

The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of data, including information on the location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, and other relevant metrics. It also includes data on the demographic and economic characteristics of different regions, such as population, population density, median age, and GDP per capita.
