Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics

Since awareness about COVID-19 began growing globally, numerous health datasets have been made publicly available for re-users to utilize in creating informative platforms and interactive maps, for instance, to support citizens in taking proactive measures to maintain their well-being, such as avoiding high-risk areas.

This dataset aims to mobilize researchers to apply cutting-edge advancements in natural language processing to generate novel insights in support of combating this infectious disease.
