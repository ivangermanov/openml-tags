QSAR-TID-184 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II is a single protein also known as Cell Growth-Inhibiting Gene twenty-seven Protein, FGCP, Folate Hydrolase one, FOLH, and FOLH one. It is an enzyme that belongs to the metallo protease M twenty-eight family and metallo protease M twenty-eight B subfamily.
