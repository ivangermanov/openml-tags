Context 
Team Fight Tactics is an eight-player free-for-all drafting tactics game where the player recruits powerful champions, deploys them, and battles to become the last player standing. When acquired, a champion starts as a One Star. Three of the same One Star champion can be combined to create a stronger Two Star champion. Three of the same Two Star champions can be combined to create an even stronger Three Star champion. Champions have one Origin and one Class, with a few exceptions. Satisfying the Origin or Class conditions grants bonus effects to the entire team or to the champions of the respective Origin or Class. A champion can hold up to three Items at a time.

In Set Four: Fates, Chosen champions occasionally appear in a player's shop. The player can have at most one Chosen champion in the game.

They also gain a unique bonus Stat, based on the champion.
