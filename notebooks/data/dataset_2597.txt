The Andromeda dataset is a multivariate regression data set concerned with predicting future values for six water quality variables - temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, oxygen, and turbidity - in Thermaikos Gulf of Thessaloniki, Greece. The measurements of these target variables were taken from underwater sensors with a regular sampling interval, and then averaged to obtain a single measurement for each variable over each day. 

In this particular dataset, a window of five days was used, meaning that feature attributes corresponded to the values of the six water quality variables up to five days in the past. Additionally, a lead time of five days was employed, implying that the goal was to predict the values of each variable six days ahead.

The dataset includes various features, including multiple windows of past measurements, which serve as inputs to predict the future values of the six water quality variables. 

The Andromeda dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on multivariate regression tasks, particularly those focused on environmental monitoring and predictive modeling.
