QSAR-TID-100433 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100433. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100433. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Lysophosphatidic acid receptor Edg-seven, which is a single protein target.

The Lysophosphatidic acid receptor Edg-seven is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor group. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and gene expression.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop QSAR models for the Lysophosphatidic acid receptor Edg-seven. The FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints can be used as input features for QSAR modeling.
