The Used Cars Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's incredibly challenging to gather all of them in one place. A web scraping tool was initially developed for a school project, which was later expanded to create this comprehensive dataset comprising every used vehicle listing within the United States on Craigslist.

This dataset is updated periodically, approximately every few months, and encompasses nearly all pertinent information provided by Craigslist regarding car sales. The included columns consist of essential details such as price, condition, manufacturer, latitude and longitude coordinates, among eighteen other categories. For machine learning projects, it may be beneficial to focus on feature engineering using location-based columns, specifically longitude and latitude. To access archived listings, please refer to previous versions of the dataset.
