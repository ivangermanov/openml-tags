QSAR-TID-103095 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103095. The dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103095. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The drug target is a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and cell proliferation.

The dataset also contains information about the compounds, including their IDs, SMILES strings, and activity values. The activity values are expressed in terms of pseudo-pCI50, which is a measure of the compound's potency.
