QSAR-TID-10627 Dataset: Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10627. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. 

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints 

MetaQSAR Project - September two thousand fifteen 

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10627. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10627.
