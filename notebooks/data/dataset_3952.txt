This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Adenosine Transporter One, and it has thirty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen.
