Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate collinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

The Friedman function is widely used for data generation and includes both linear and non-linear relations between input and output, with normalized noise added to the output. The function is defined as:

y = ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus zero point five squared plus ten multiplied by X four plus five multiplied by X five plus e

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. To measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with different collinearity degrees, which represent the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in the number of features, number of samples, and collinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. For datasets with higher collinearity degrees, a larger number of features are generated.

The Friedman datasets are designed to test and evaluate various machine learning algorithms, particularly in scenarios involving different levels of feature interdependence and sample sizes. These datasets provide a controlled environment for assessing the performance and robustness of predictive models under various conditions.

The last attribute in each file represents the target variable. The features are labeled as oz followed by a number, ranging from one to twenty-six.
