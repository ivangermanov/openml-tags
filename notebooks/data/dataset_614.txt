This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

The dataset includes the following features: Scorer One, Scorer Two, and Subject, along with a Binary Class label.
