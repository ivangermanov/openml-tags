QSAR-TID-10004 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand four, and it has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint one, fingerprint two, fingerprint three, and so on up to fingerprint one thousand twenty-four.
