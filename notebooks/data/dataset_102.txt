Normalized Version of the Poker Hand Data Set

The Poker Hand dataset is a collection of examples, where each record represents a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of fifty-two cards. Each card is described using two attributes: suit and rank, resulting in a total of ten predictive attributes. Additionally, there is one Class attribute that categorizes the hand into a specific type of poker hand.

The order of cards is crucial, which explains why there are four hundred eighty possible Royal Flush hands, as opposed to four, one for each suit.

This dataset does not contain any missing values.

The attributes include:

* Suit of Card Number One, represented on an ordinal scale from one to four, denoting Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs.
* Rank of Card Number One, represented on a numerical scale from one to thirteen, denoting Ace, Two, Three, ..., Queen, and King.
* Similarly, the suits and ranks of the remaining four cards are also represented using ordinal and numerical scales, respectively.

The Class attribute categorizes the hand into one of ten possible types of poker hands, including:
* Nothing in Hand, indicating that the hand does not form a recognized poker hand.
* One Pair, indicating that the hand contains one pair of equal ranks within the five cards.
* Two Pairs, indicating that the hand contains two pairs of equal ranks within the five cards.
* Three of a Kind, indicating that the hand contains three equal ranks within the five cards.
* Straight, indicating that the hand contains five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps.
* Flush, indicating that the hand contains five cards with the same suit.
* Full House, indicating that the hand contains a pair and a different rank three of a kind.
* Four of a Kind, indicating that the hand contains four equal ranks within the five cards.
* Straight Flush, indicating that the hand contains a straight and a flush.
* Royal Flush, indicating that the hand contains an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten, all of the same suit.
