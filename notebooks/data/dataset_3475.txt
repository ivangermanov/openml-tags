The QSAR-TID-137 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 137. It has multiple rows and features, including molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

This dataset is particularly interesting because it represents a single protein target, specifically the kappa opioid receptor, which is a type of membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor group. The kappa opioid receptor plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including immune response, signal transduction, and behavioral responses.

The dataset includes multiple features, such as molecular descriptors and pharmacological properties, which are essential for understanding the structure-activity relationships of compounds interacting with the kappa opioid receptor. These features can be used to develop predictive models for identifying potential drug candidates targeting this receptor.

The kappa opioid receptor is involved in various biological processes, including sensory perception, locomotory behavior, and response to different stimuli. It also plays a role in regulating certain physiological functions, such as dopamine secretion, luteinizing hormone secretion, and saliva secretion.

The dataset provides valuable information for researchers and scientists working in the field of pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, and biochemistry. It offers insights into the structure-activity relationships of compounds targeting the kappa opioid receptor, which can aid in the discovery of novel therapeutic agents.
