QSAR-TID-137 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 137. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 3689 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

The Kappa Opioid Receptor is a single protein, also known as Kappa-type Opioid Receptor, K-OR-1, KOR-1, OPRK, and OPRK1. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including immune response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The receptor is targeted by several compounds, including Dezocine, Buprenorphine, Levallorphan, and Nalfurafine. These compounds have different mechanisms of action, such as kappa opioid receptor antagonist, kappa opioid receptor agonist, and kappa opioid receptor partial agonist.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is involved in various physiological processes, including pain perception, behavior, and response to stimuli.
