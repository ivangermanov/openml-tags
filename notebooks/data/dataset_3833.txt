This dataset, QSAR-TID-12898, tagged with Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study three, and Transportation, is part of the MetaQSAR project from September 2015.

It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12898, with twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six molecular fingerprint zero, FCFP six molecular fingerprint one, and so on up to FCFP six molecular fingerprint nine hundred twenty-five.

Scraped data includes information about endothelin-converting enzyme one, a single protein preferred name, also known as ECE one or ECE-one, with synonyms ECE-one and endothelin-converting enzyme one.

Organism information includes Bos taurus species group, classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, MAE clan, metallo protease M thirteen family.

Description relationships and accession include endothelin-converting enzyme one, single protein, with accession P four two eight nine one.

Expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process information are also included, with details about plasma membrane, membrane, endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, protein homodimerization activity, metal ion binding, proteolysis, protein processing, peptide hormone processing, and other related terms.

CanSAR-target, reactome, uniprot, interpro, and pfam information are also provided, with accession P four two eight nine one, peptide ligand-binding receptors, A two V DM nine, P four two eight nine one, peptidase M thirteen, peptidase M thirteen N, peptidase M thirteen C, metallopeptidase catalytic domain superfamily, peptidase M thirteen domain two, PF zero one four three one, and PF zero five six four nine.
