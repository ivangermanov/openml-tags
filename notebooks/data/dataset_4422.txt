Subsampling of the dataset RL with seed equal to two arguments number rows max equal to two thousand arguments number cols max equal to one hundred arguments number classes max equal to ten arguments no stratify equals False.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in five parameters - seed, number rows maximum, number columns maximum, number classes maximum, and stratified - and returns a dataset. It first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. Then, it extracts the features and target variables from the dataset. 

If the number of unique classes in the target variable exceeds the number classes maximum, it selects a specified number of classes randomly based on their frequencies. It then filters the data to only include instances belonging to the selected classes.

Next, if the number of feature columns exceeds the number columns maximum, it randomly selects a specified number of feature columns. It rearranges the column indices in ascending order and filters the data to only include the selected feature columns.

Finally, if the total number of instances exceeds the number rows maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a specified number of instances based on the target variable. The resulting dataset consists of the filtered features, target variable, and categorical mask.
