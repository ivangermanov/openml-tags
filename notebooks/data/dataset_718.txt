Fri C4 1000 100 is a binarized regression problem dataset related to Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is part of several studies, including Mythbusting Study One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, and Study Seven.

The dataset has been converted from its original form to have a two-class nominal target feature. The conversion was done by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as negative, denoted by 'N'.

The dataset consists of numerous features, although they appear to be machine-generated and lack descriptive names. These features are essential for analyzing and understanding the relationships within the dataset.
