Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features range from oz one to oz one hundred, with additional features beyond that.

The dataset appears to be a modified version of an existing dataset, where the target variable has been transformed into a binary classification problem. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean of the original numeric target and then categorizing values below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N').

The purpose of this binarization process is likely to facilitate certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that require categorical outcomes rather than continuous values. By converting the regression problem into a classification problem, researchers can apply different analytical techniques or algorithms suited for binary outcomes.

The original source and date of this dataset are not specified, which may limit the ability to trace its provenance or verify its authenticity. Users of this dataset should be aware of this limitation and exercise caution when drawing conclusions or making generalizations based on the data.
