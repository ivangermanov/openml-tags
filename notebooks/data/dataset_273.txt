**Garrat2 Dataset**

This dataset is part of a collection of forty-one drug design datasets. Each dataset consists of molecules and their corresponding outputs, which were obtained from various original studies.

The datasets were formed using Adriana.Code software, which generated 1143 features. The molecules and outputs used in these datasets were taken directly from the original studies.

One of these original studies is titled "Neighborhood Behavior: A Useful Concept for Validation of 'Molecular Diversity' Descriptors", which was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in 1996.

Another study, titled "General Melting Point Prediction Based on a Diverse Compound Dataset and Artificial Neural Networks", was published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling in 2005.

Other original studies include "Syntheses, Pharmacological Evaluation, and Molecular Modelling of Substituted Six-Alkoxyimidazo[1,2-b]Pyridazines as New Ligands for the Benzodiazepine Receptor", published in the European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in 1996, and "Weighted Holistic Invariant Molecular Descriptors. Part 2. Theory Development and Applications on Modeling Physico-Chemical Properties of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)", published in Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems in 1995.

Keywords: Drug Design, Molecular Diversity, Neighborhood Behavior, Melting Point Prediction, Artificial Neural Networks.
