This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The dataset covers various aspects of drug design and molecular properties, including melting point prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships (QSBR), and toxicity prediction. It encompasses studies on diverse compounds such as carbolenes, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitors.

Multiple original studies are referenced, covering topics like molecular descriptors influencing melting points, neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity validation, general melting point prediction using artificial neural networks, and development of linear and non-linear models for predicting biological activity.

The dataset also includes information on structure-biodegradability relationships for chlorinated compounds, mechanism-based quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships for dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, and quantitative structure-function and structure-stability relationships of purposely modified proteins.

Additional studies focus on stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, structure-activity relationships of antifilarial antimycin analogues, and various other aspects of molecular modeling and drug design.

The features in the dataset are numerous and appear to be generated by specialized software, representing various molecular descriptors and properties relevant to drug design and chemical informatics.
