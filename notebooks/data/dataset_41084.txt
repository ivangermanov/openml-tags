The Sheffield Face Database, previously known as the UMIST Face Database, is a collection of five hundred and seventy-five grayscale images of twenty individuals with mixed race, gender, and appearance. Each individual is shown in a range of poses, from profile to frontal views, with each pose in a separate directory labeled accordingly. The images are numbered consecutively as they were taken.

The database consists of manually cropped faces, with a resolution of one hundred and twelve by ninety-two pixels, and an eight-bit grayscale intensity range of zero to two hundred and fifty-five. The images were cropped by Daniel Graham at UMIST.

The database is characterized by its variability in pose, with each individual shown in a range of poses, making it a valuable resource for face recognition research.

Vision is a key aspect of this database, as it is designed to facilitate the development of face recognition systems that can handle variations in pose and appearance.
