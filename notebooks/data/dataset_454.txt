The Friedman dataset is an artificially generated collection of eighty datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate the level of colinearity and the number of samples and features. 

Friedman functions are widely used for data generation and incorporate both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, with a normalized noise added to the output. The Friedman function is characterized by the equation: y equals ten times the sine of pi times x one times x two plus twenty times the square of x three minus point five, plus ten times X four plus five times X five, plus epsilon.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To assess the impact of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. Furthermore, to evaluate an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity. 

Colinearity refers to the number of features dependent on other features. The generated Friedman dataset parameters include the number of features, which ranges from five to one hundred, with only the first five features being related to the output, while the rest are completely random. The number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand. 

There are five different colinearity degrees, ranging from zero to four. For datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. Consequently, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining four different feature numbers, four different sample numbers, and five different colinearity degrees. 

The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.
