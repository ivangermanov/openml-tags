The Meta Album Airplanes Dataset Extended 

The original Airplanes dataset comprises over nine thousand remote sensing images acquired from Google Earth satellite imagery, including twenty-one different types of aircraft from around thirty-six airports. All the images were carefully labeled by specialists in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. Each class has a varying number of images, ranging from two hundred thirty to eight forty-six images, where each image contains only one complete aircraft, and they have variable resolutions.

To preprocess this dataset, we cropped the images from either side to make them square, and then we resized them into one twenty-eight by one twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
