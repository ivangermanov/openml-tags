Russian Presidential Elections 2018

Context: Throughout the history of Russian elections, there have been some interesting anomalies in the voting results. This dataset provides an opportunity to explore and identify these anomalies.

Content: Each row of the dataset represents detailed voting results from a local election commission, which is the lowest level of the Russian election system. Local election sites serve as a means for a small group of people living nearby to cast their votes. Typically, the number of voters linked to each election site ranges from one thousand to two thousand. However, for foreign-based election sites located at Russian embassies around the world, the number of linked voters can be significantly higher.

Acknowledgements: The dataset is available on GitHub. The raw data was obtained from a renowned Russian election statistics researcher.

Features: region name, election commission name, voting site name, number of registered voters, number of received ballots, and votes cast for each presidential candidate.

Keywords: Russian elections, voting anomalies, election commission, local election sites, presidential candidates.
