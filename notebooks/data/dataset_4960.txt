**Water Bayesian Network. Sample Eight**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, resulting in ten thousand eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, while the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree is five.

The Water Bayesian Network was created to model the management of waste water treatment plants.
