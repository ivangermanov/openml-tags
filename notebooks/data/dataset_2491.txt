This dataset is part of a collection of datasets based on the game Jungle Chess, also known as Dou Shou Qi. For a description of the rules, please refer to the paper. The paper also contains a description of various constructed features.

As the tablebases are a disjoint set of several tablebases based on which two pieces are on the board, we have uploaded all tablebases that have explicit different content:

* Rat versus Rat
* Rat versus Panther
* Rat versus Lion
* Rat versus Elephant
* Panther versus Lion
* Panther versus Elephant
* Tiger versus Lion
* Lion versus Lion
* Lion versus Elephant
* Elephant versus Elephant
* Complete (Combination of the above)
* Raw Complete (Combination of the above, containing for both pieces just the rank, file, and strength information)

This dataset contains a similar classification problem as, for example, the King and Rook versus King problem and is suitable for classification tasks. Note that this dataset is one of the above-mentioned datasets. Additionally, note that several sub-problems are very similar. Having seen a given position from one of the tablebases arguably gives a lot of information about the outcome of the same position in the other tablebases.
