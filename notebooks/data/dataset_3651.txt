QSAR-TID-11522 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11522. The dataset has 1585 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Cholecystokinin B receptor, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including gastric acid secretion, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway.

The Cholecystokinin B receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gastric acid secretion and gut function. It is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Cholecystokinin B receptor.
