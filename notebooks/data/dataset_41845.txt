**Data Description**

This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EurUsd currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded during those days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the subsequent minute relative to the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases in the following minute and false when the mean high price decreases or remains the same.

Please note that this task is purely hypothetical and intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should only be applied to predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.
