The Friedman Datasets 

These eighty artificially generated datasets originate from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded according to their characteristics, specifically the degree of collinearity and the number of samples and features.

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, with a normalized noise added to the output. This function has been widely used for generating data due to its ability to simulate real-world complexities.

The Friedman function takes into account five features as inputs, which are related to the output. To test the effect of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These extra features are independent of the output. Furthermore, to evaluate an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of collinearity. Collinearity refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The parameters and values of the generated Friedman datasets are as follows:

The number of features varies from five to one hundred, with only the first five features being relevant to the output. The remaining features are randomly generated. 

The number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand.

The collinearity degree ranges from zero to four, indicating the level of dependency among features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample sizes, and collinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file represents the target variable.
