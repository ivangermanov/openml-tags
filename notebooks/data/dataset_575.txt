Data Description

This data set is from the Computational Intelligence and Learning (COIL) competition. The data contains measurements of river chemical concentrations and algae densities. It comes from a water quality study where samples were taken from sites on different European rivers over a period of approximately one year. These samples were analyzed for various chemical substances including nitrogen in the form of nitrates, nitrites and ammonia, phosphate, pH, oxygen, and chloride. In parallel, algae samples were collected to determine the algae population distributions.

The competition involved the prediction of algal frequency distributions based on the measured concentrations of chemical substances and global information concerning the season when the sample was taken, the river size, and its flow velocity. The competition instructions contain additional information on the prediction task.

Data Characteristics

There are a total of 340 examples, each containing 17 values. The first 11 values of each data set are the season, the river size, the fluid velocity, and 8 chemical concentrations which should be relevant for the algae population distribution. The last 8 values of each example are the distribution of different kinds of algae. These 8 kinds represent only a small part of the whole community, but for the competition, the number was limited to 7. A value of 0.0 means that the frequency is very low. The data set also contains some empty fields which are labeled with the string "XXXXX".

Data Format

The training data are saved in a file named "analysis.data" in ASCII format. The structure of the file includes chemical concentrations or river characteristics (labeled as CC) and algal frequencies (labeled as AG). The chemical parameters are labeled as A through K, while the columns of the algae are labeled as a through g.

Task Description

The competition task is to predict algal frequency distributions based on the measured concentrations of chemical substances and global information about the sample. Participants receive 200 complete data sets for training and 140 data sets for evaluation. The evaluation data contains only the 11 values of river descriptions and chemical concentrations.

The objective is to provide a prediction model based on the training data and apply it to the evaluation data. All 7 algae frequency distributions must be determined, and any number of partial models may be developed. The results will be judged based on the sum of squared errors.

This dataset presents a complex real life problem involving a mixture of qualitative variables and numerical measurement values, with some incomplete data. It requires the application of advanced techniques to understand the relationship between chemical and biological features in aquatic environments.
