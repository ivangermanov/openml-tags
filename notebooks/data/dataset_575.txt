Analcatdata Supreme Dataset

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset explores various aspects of Chemistry and Life Science, aiming to debunk myths and provide insights through rigorous studies.

The dataset includes several features, including Actions Taken, Level of Liberalism, Constitutionality, Alteration of Precedents, Unanimity, Year of Decision, and Disagreements in Lower Courts.
