This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: eleven thousand one hundred five, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, and others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September two thousand fifteen.
