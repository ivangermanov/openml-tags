This dataset, obtained from UCI, focuses on diabetes in Pima Indian women. The data was collected from a population near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The diagnostic variable investigated is whether the patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization criteria, specifically if the two-hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 200 mg/dl at any survey examination or if found during routine medical care.

The dataset comprises females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. It contains 768 instances with 8 attributes plus a class variable. The attributes include number of times pregnant, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, two-hour serum insulin, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The class variable is binary, indicating whether the individual tested positive or negative for diabetes.

The data has been used in past research to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus using various learning algorithms. One such study employed the ADAP learning algorithm, which generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like devices. Using 576 training instances, the sensitivity and specificity of their algorithm was 76% on the remaining 192 instances.

This dataset is particularly valuable for machine learning and medical research due to its completeness, with no missing attribute values. The class distribution shows 500 instances of negative test results and 268 instances of positive test results for diabetes.

The attributes in the dataset provide a comprehensive view of factors that may contribute to diabetes, including both physiological measurements and genetic predisposition. This makes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database a rich resource for studying the interplay between various health indicators and the development of diabetes in a specific population.
