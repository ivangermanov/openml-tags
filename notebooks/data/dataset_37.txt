**Pima Indians Diabetes Database**

Tags: Health, Medicine, Mythbusting, Study

This dataset is related to the diagnosis of diabetes based on personal and medical characteristics. The goal is to predict whether a person has signs of diabetes according to the World Health Organization criteria.

The dataset was obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and donated by the Research Center, RMI Group Leader, Applied Physics Laboratory, The Johns Hopkins University.

In the past, this dataset has been used to develop and test algorithms for predicting the onset of diabetes mellitus. One such algorithm, called ADAP, was developed to forecast the onset of diabetes based on various attributes. The results showed a sensitivity and specificity of seventy-six percent when using a cutoff of 0.448.

The dataset consists of eight attributes, including the number of times pregnant, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, two-hour serum insulin, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The class variable indicates whether the person has been tested positive for diabetes or not.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of instances from a larger database. All patients in this dataset are female, at least twenty-one years old, and of Pima Indian heritage.

There are no missing attribute values in the dataset. The class distribution shows that five hundred instances have been tested negative for diabetes, while two hundred sixty-eight instances have been tested positive.

A brief statistical analysis of the attributes reveals the mean and standard deviation for each attribute.
