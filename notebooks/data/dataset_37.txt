Haberman's Survival Data

This dataset contains cases from a study conducted between nineteen fifty-eight and nineteen seventy at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

Past usage of this dataset includes various studies and publications, including Generalized Residuals for Log-Linear Models, Graphical Models for Assessing Logistic Regression Models, and Logistic Regression Trees.

The dataset consists of three hundred six instances, each representing a patient, with four attributes. There are no missing values in the dataset.

Attribute information includes:

Age of patient at time of operation, which is a numerical value representing the patient's age when they underwent surgery.
Patient's year of operation, which is a numerical value representing the year of surgery minus nineteen hundred.
Number of positive axillary nodes detected, which is a numerical value indicating the number of nodes affected by cancer.
Survival status, which is the class attribute, where one indicates the patient survived five years or longer, and two indicates the patient died within five years.
