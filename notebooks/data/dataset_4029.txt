QSAR-TID-11296 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11296. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11296. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Histamine H1 receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as H1R, HH1R, Histamine H1 receptor, and Hrh1. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, synaptic transmission, and response to stimulus.

The dataset provides information about the receptor's classification, including its protein target classification, which is one point membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor. The dataset also provides information about the receptor's synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Histamine H1 receptor.
