This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Single Protein Preferred Name Serine Threonine Protein Kinase RIP Two, and it has eighty-nine rows.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC fifty.
