QSAR-TID-101278 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101278. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101278. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 101278, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO three is a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including immune system process, protein phosphorylation, and ribosome biogenesis. It is also involved in the maturation of SSU-rRNA and the negative regulation of protein-containing complex assembly.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for the serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO three. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of activity values for various compounds, which can be used to train and validate QSAR models.
