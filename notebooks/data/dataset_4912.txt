**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Four.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository, specifically listed under the discrete-medium category.

The Barley Bayesian Network consists of forty-eight nodes connected by eighty-four arcs, resulting in one hundred fourteen thousand five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, while the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree of this network is four.

This preliminary model was developed for barley production under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". 

Some of the notable features of this network include variables related to crop characteristics, soil properties, and farming practices. These variables are essential in understanding the complex relationships within the barley production process.
