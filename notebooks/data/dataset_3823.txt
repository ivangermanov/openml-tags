This is an extremely beginner friendly dataset, perfect for those new to data analysis. Although it does contain a significant amount of missing values, it presents an excellent opportunity to explore the application of linear regression models in identifying patterns between various predictors, such as hour and price. One of the most fascinating aspects of this dataset is the inclusion of corresponding weather information for each hour, complete with a concise summary of the weather conditions.

Some other crucial factors to consider include temperature, wind speed, and sunset time. These variables provide valuable insights into how external factors influence the prices of ride-hailing services.
