The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number".

Friedman's function is one of the most widely used functions for data generation. This function includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is defined as follows: y equals ten times the sine of pi times x one times x two plus twenty times the square of x three minus point five, plus ten times X four plus five times X five plus e.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. The collinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: The number of features varies, but only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. Similarly, the number of samples also varies. There are five different collinearity degrees.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target.
