Past Usage: The dataset has been used in research on forecasting skewed biased stochastic ozone days, with analyses and solutions published in Knowledge and Information Systems and presented at ICDM.

Relevant Information: This dataset contains specifications for several important attributes highly valued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Key attributes include local ozone peak prediction, upwind ozone background level, precursor emissions related factor, maximum temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, base temperature where net ozone production begins (50Â°F), solar radiation total for the day, wind speed near sunrise, and wind speed mid-day.

Number of Instances: 2536
Number of Attributes: 73

Attribute Information: The dataset includes two classes: ozone day and normal day. Features include various measurements of wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and other meteorological factors at different times throughout the day and at various atmospheric pressure levels.

The dataset contains continuous variables such as peak wind speed, average wind speed, peak temperature, average temperature, temperature and relative humidity at different atmospheric pressure levels (850 hPa, 700 hPa, 500 hPa), geopotential height, U and V wind components, K-Index, T-Totals, sea level pressure, sea level pressure change from the previous day, and precipitation.

Additional Variable Information: The dataset includes specifications for attributes highly valued by TCEQ, such as local ozone peak prediction, upwind ozone background level, precursor emissions related factor, maximum temperature, base temperature for net ozone production, solar radiation total, and wind speeds at specific times.

Missing Values: Yes, the dataset contains missing values.
