QSAR-TID-100417 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100417. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1239 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase receptor is a single protein target, also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor, which is a protein containing complex involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, nervous system development, and brain development.

The receptor is a transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell population proliferation, apoptosis, and neuron differentiation.

Several compounds have been identified as inhibitors of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase receptor, including Alectinib, Brigatinib, Crizotinib, and Lorlatinib, which have been approved for the treatment of various types of cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for the development of new inhibitors of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase receptor, which could lead to the discovery of new treatments for cancer and other diseases.
