The QSAR-TID-100855 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 100855. This dataset has eight hundred eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: one hundred eighty-five five.

The features do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the physical and chemical properties of molecules.

The dataset is related to the government and MTLQSAR study three. It is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling.

This dataset describes the serine-threonine-protein kinase PIM three, which is a single protein preferred name. It has synonyms such as PIM three and serine-threonine-protein kinase pim-three. The organism is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group.

The protein target classification is one enzyme-kinase-protein kinase-CAMK protein kinase group-CAMK protein kinase PIM family. The description relates to the serine-threonine-protein kinase pim-three.

The dataset also provides information on gene ontology components, functions, and processes. The gene ontology components include cytoplasm and cytosol. The gene ontology functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine-threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

The gene ontology processes include protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, cell cycle, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, phosphorylation, negative regulation of apoptotic process, protein autophosphorylation, and negative regulation of insulin secretion involved in cellular response to glucose stimulus.

Additionally, the dataset provides information on canSAR-target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
