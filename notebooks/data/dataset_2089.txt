The QSAR-TID-103081 dataset, tagged as Machine Learning, Manufacturing, and MTLQSAR, is part of the MetaQSAR project. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103081.

This dataset has forty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features, specifically MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated. The dataset includes various features, such as molecule Chembl ID, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four zero, fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four one, and so on.

This dataset is related to Pseudolysin, also known as elastase lasB, neutral metalloproteinase PAE, pro-elastase, and other synonyms. It belongs to the species group Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain ATCC fifteen thousand six hundred ninety-two slash PAO one slash one C slash PRS one hundred one slash LMG twelve thousand two hundred twenty-eight.

The protein target classification is enzyme, protease, metalloprotease, MAE clan, and metalloprotease M four family. The description relationship accession is elastase single protein P fourteen thousand seven hundred fifty-six.

There are various go components, functions, and processes associated with this dataset, including extracellular region, endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, proteolysis, protein secretion by the type two secretion system, protein transport by the sec complex, single-species biofilm formation, and bacterial-type flagellum-dependent swarming motility.

Additionally, there are connections to canSAR-target, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
