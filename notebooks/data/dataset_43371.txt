Has the Curve Flattened?

Countries around the world are working tirelessly to flatten the curve of the Coronavirus Pandemic. Flattening the curve involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next, thereby helping to prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed. When a country has fewer new COVID-19 cases emerging today than it did on a previous day, that's a clear indication that the country is successfully flattening the curve.

On a trend line of total cases, a flattened curve appears exactly as it sounds - flat. Conversely, on the charts displayed on this webpage, which illustrate new cases per day, a flattened curve will exhibit a distinct downward trend in the number of daily new cases.

This comprehensive analysis employs a five-day moving average to effectively visualize the number of new COVID-19 cases and accurately calculate the rate of change. This calculation is performed for each day by averaging the values of that particular day, the two preceding days, and the two subsequent days. This approach proves instrumental in preventing major events, such as changes in reporting methods, from significantly distorting the data.

The interactive charts presented below vividly illustrate the daily number of new cases for the ten most severely affected countries, based on the reported number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.
