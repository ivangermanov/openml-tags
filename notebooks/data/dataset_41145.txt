The goal of this challenge is to expose the research community to real-world datasets of interest to four paradigm. All datasets are formatted in a uniform way, though the type of data might differ. The data are provided as preprocessed matrices, so that participants can focus on classification, although participants are welcome to use additional feature extraction procedures as long as they do not violate any rule of the challenge.

All problems are binary classification problems and are assessed with the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, though its structure is revealed. The final score in phase two will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets, a ranking will be generated from such results, and winners will be determined according to such ranking.

The tasks are constrained by a time budget. The CodaLab platform provides computational resources shared by all participants. Each code submission will be executed in a compute worker with the following characteristics: two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, forty gigabytes of solid-state drive with Ubuntu operating system. To ensure the fairness of the evaluation, when a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited in time.

The Philippine dataset features a range of variables, including class and multiple other variables.
