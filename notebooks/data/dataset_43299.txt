Cause-Effect is a growing database of two-variable cause-effect pairs created at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in TÃ¼bingen, Germany.

Some pairs are high-dimensional, and for machine readability, the relevant information about this is coded in metadata. The metadata contains the following information: number of pair, first column of cause, last column of cause, first column of effect, last column of effect, and dataset weight. The dataset weight should be used for calculating average performance of causal inference methods to avoid a bias introduced by having multiple copies of essentially the same data.

When using this dataset in a publication, please cite the paper "Distinguishing Cause from Effect Using Observational Data: Methods and Benchmarks" published in the Journal of Machine Learning Research.

The dataset pairs from one to forty-one are taken from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Overview of all data pairs:

Variable One, Variable Two, Dataset, Ground Truth
pair0001: Altitude, Temperature, DWD, ->
pair0002: Altitude, Precipitation, DWD, ->
pair0003: Longitude, Temperature, DWD, ->
pair0004: Altitude, Sunshine Hours, DWD, ->

Information for pair0005:
The Abalone dataset is a collection of data from the Marine Resources Division Marine Research Laboratories in Tasmania, Australia. The dataset was donated by the Department of Computer Science, University of Tasmania.
