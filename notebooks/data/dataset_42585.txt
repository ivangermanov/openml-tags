## Description

The Palmer Penguins dataset is a great alternative to the Iris dataset for data exploration and visualization. The data was collected and made available by the Palmer Station, Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research Network. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore and visualize the characteristics of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Citation

The data should be cited according to the US Long Term Ecological Research Network's Data Access Policy, Requirements, and Use Agreement. The dataset has been derived from the R package Palmer Penguins.

## Artwork

The Palmer Penguins artwork is available for download from the Github repository or the R package. The artwork is useful for teaching with the data and should be cited as "Artwork by the Palmer Penguins team".

#### Bill Dimensions

The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird's bill. In this simplified dataset, the culmen length and depth are measured to provide insight into the physical characteristics of the penguins. The culmen length and depth are important features that can be used to identify and distinguish between different species of penguins.

The dataset includes the following features: species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.
