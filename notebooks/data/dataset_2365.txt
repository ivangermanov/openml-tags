Guess which points belong to signal track 

COMET is an experiment being constructed at the J-Parc Proton Beam Laboratory in Japan. It will search for coherent neutrino-less conversion of a muon to an electron, mu plus Nuclear Material yields Electron plus Nuclear Material. This process breaks the law of lepton conservation. If detected, it will be a signal of new physics.

The previous upper limit for this decay was set by the Sindrum Two experiment. COMET is designed to have ten thousand times better sensitivity.

The Cylindrical Drift Chamber 

The COMET experiment is looking for muon to electron conversion, Muon plus Nuclear Material yields Electron plus Nuclear Material. COMET Phase-One will utilize the Cylindrical Drift Chamber as the primary detector for physics measurements. Specifically, the momentum of resulting particles will be measured using the CyDet, which is a cylindrical wire array detector. The particles flying out of muon-stopping target and registered by the CyDet. Among those, we are interested in tracks left by electrons with specific energy, which are produced by muon to electron conversion.

The CyDet consists of four thousand four hundred eighty-two sensitive wires organized in eighteen layers. Each wire measures the energy deposited by a passing charged particle. Within each of the layers, the wires have the same distance to the stopping target and stereometric angle.

There is a magnetic field in the detector, which causes electrons to move in a helical path as shown below. This electron deposits energy in the wires close to the flight path. The radius of the helix is proportional to the transverse momentum of the electron: Radius equals Transverse Momentum divided by the product of Electric Charge and Magnetic Field Strength.

The energy deposited on each wire is measured at the end plate of the cylindrical detector. An example of the resulting signal event can be seen below, where blue dots are background hits and red are hits from signal electrons:

More Details 

One can find more information about COMET on its official website. Additionally, one can read the COMET Conceptual Design Report for further insight. For those who are not familiar with High Energy Physics, there is a great introductory article in Russian that explains what COMET is all about. There is also a COMET presentation available online. Finally, one can read about A Search for Mu-E Conversion in Muonic Gold.

Important Note 

Datasets available for this challenge are results of preliminary Monte Carlo simulation. They do not completely represent properties of COMET's detector and thus cannot be used to estimate final properties of the tracking system, but are appropriate to test different approaches to tracking.
