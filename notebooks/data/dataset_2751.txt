**Data Description:** This dataset consists of historical price data of the New Zealand Dollar versus United States Dollar (NZD/USD) Forex pair obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one daily candlestick, covering the period from January to December. Since Forex markets are closed on weekends, there are no records for Saturday and Sunday.

The timestamp feature is presented in the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price for the subsequent day relative to the mean high price of the current day. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean high price increases the following day and false if it decreases or remains unchanged.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for developing realistic trading strategies. For practical applications, focus on predicting close prices instead.
