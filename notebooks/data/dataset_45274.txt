The PASS Dataset: A Large Scale Image Collection for Astronomy 

This dataset is a comprehensive collection of images specifically designed for astronomy research and applications. One of its significant advantages is that it does not contain any images of humans, thereby minimizing privacy concerns. This unique feature makes it an ideal choice for high-quality pre-training purposes.

Each entry in the dataset includes essential metadata such as date taken, license information, and geographic coordinates including latitude and longitude. The dataset also provides a unique URL for each image, allowing easy access and retrieval.
