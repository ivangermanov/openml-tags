PASS is a large scale image dataset that does not include any human beings and can be used for high quality pretraining while significantly reducing privacy concerns. This dataset is particularly useful because it does not contain any images of people, which makes it an ideal choice for pretraining models without compromising on privacy. The dataset is uploaded by the OpenML team and contains a wide range of features, including index, username, date taken, license name, and URL.
