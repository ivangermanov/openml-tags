Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Amazon Employee Access, Generated with the following source code

This dataset is a subsample of the Amazon Employee Access dataset, generated using a specific source code. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns, as well as stratified sampling of rows.

The source code defines a function called subsample, which takes in several parameters, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. The function uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility.

The subsampling process first selects a subset of classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum specified. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns, selecting a subset of columns if the total number of columns exceeds the maximum specified. It then filters the data to include only the selected columns.

Finally, the function stratifies the sampling of rows, ensuring that the number of rows does not exceed the maximum specified. It uses the train test split function from scikit-learn to perform the stratified sampling.

The resulting dataset includes the following features: Resource, Manager ID, Role Rollup One, Role Rollup Two, Role Department Name, Role Title, Role Family Description, Role Family, and Role Code.
