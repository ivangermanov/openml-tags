Magic Telescope Dataset

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. It was transformed in the same way as the dataset used in the tabular data benchmark.

The Magic Telescope dataset is a collection of data generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, to simulate the registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The data consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. The camera observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere.

The available information consists of patterns, called the shower image, allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background). Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source.

A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse, often called Hillas parameters, are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination.

There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions. The dataset was generated to observe events with energies down to below fifty gigaelectronvolts.

The dataset contains ten continuous features, which are the major axis of ellipse, minor axis of ellipse, ten-log of sum of content of all pixels, ratio of sum of two highest pixels over the sum of content, ratio of highest pixel over the sum of content, distance from highest pixel to center projected onto major axis, third root of third moment along major axis, third root of third moment along minor axis, angle of major axis with vector to origin, and distance from origin to center of ellipse.

The dataset also contains a class feature, which is either gamma (signal) or hadron (background). The number of hadron events is underestimated in the dataset, but in real data, the hadron class represents the majority of the events. The simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal event as background. For comparison of different classifiers, an ROC curve has to be used.
