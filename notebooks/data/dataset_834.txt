Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are likely measurements or attributes related to the study, but their specific meanings are not provided in the original text.

The dataset appears to be a modified version of an earlier dataset, with the primary change being the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean value of the original target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their value falls below or above this mean threshold.

The purpose of this dataset modification seems to be simplifying a potentially complex numeric prediction problem into a more straightforward binary classification task. This approach can be useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning algorithms that work better with categorical outcomes.

The original source and date of this dataset are not specified, which may limit the ability to provide proper attribution or context for its creation and intended use. Researchers or data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and the potential implications this may have on their analyses or models.
