Timing Attack Dataset: Ten Microsecond Delay Created on Twenty First September Two Thousand Twenty Two

This dataset is tagged under Machine Learning and Mathematics, specifically focused on the Bleichenbacher Timing Attack.

The dataset contains attributes describing various aspects of the attack, including:

Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement attributes, which include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags for reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN echo, urgent, acknowledgement, push, reset, syn, fin, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.

TLS Alert attributes, which include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags for reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN echo, urgent, acknowledgement, push, reset, syn, fin, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and message order.

TCP Disconnect attributes, which include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags for reserved, nonce, congestion window reduced, ECN echo, urgent, acknowledgement, push, reset, syn, fin, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.

The dataset also includes vulnerable classes, including incorrectly formatted PKCS one padding, correctly formatted PKCS one PMS message but one byte shorter, no zero in message, wrong first byte, and wrong second byte.
