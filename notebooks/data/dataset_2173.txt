This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
