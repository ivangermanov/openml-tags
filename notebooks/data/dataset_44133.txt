Pol Dataset: Computer Systems, Manufacturing 

This dataset belongs to the Regression on Numerical Features benchmark. It was originally part of a commercial application described in an academic paper. Unfortunately, no further information about the specific context or purpose of the dataset is available.

The dataset consists of a large number of cases, each described by forty-nine continuous attributes. These attributes are all numerical in nature, which makes this dataset suitable for regression tasks.

The dataset was sourced from a collection of regression datasets curated by a researcher. The original dataset in its native format can also be obtained from an online repository.

Some of the key features included in this dataset are related to computer systems and manufacturing processes. These features provide a comprehensive view of various aspects of these systems and processes, which can be useful for building predictive models.
