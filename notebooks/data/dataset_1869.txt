The QSAR-TID-101179 dataset is a collection of QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values of various compounds on drug target TID: 101179. It consists of eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains information about the serine/threonine-protein kinase tousled-like two, a single protein preferred name, also known as HsHPK, PKU-alpha, and Tousled-like kinase two.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase tousled-like two is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase belonging to the other protein kinase group, specifically the TLK family. It is found in the species Homo sapiens and has been classified under the category of enzymes, kinases, and protein kinases.

The protein has been described to have various functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and identical protein binding. It is involved in different biological processes, such as chromatin organization, protein phosphorylation, DNA damage response, cell cycle, chromosome segregation, negative regulation of autophagy, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, negative regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, intracellular signal transduction, localization, cellular response to gamma radiation, and regulation of chromatin organization.
