This Bayesian network is a representation of a complex system with seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, resulting in a large number of parameters, totaling one thousand four hundred fifty-three. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, and the average degree is three point five one, with a maximum in-degree of six.

The Hepar2 Bayesian network is a comprehensive model that incorporates a wide range of features related to liver disorders, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint pain, platelet count, and many others.

The network is designed to facilitate probabilistic causal modeling in medicine, with a specific focus on the diagnosis of liver disorders. It is a valuable resource for researchers and medical professionals seeking to better understand the complex relationships between various factors influencing liver health.

Keywords: Bayesian network, liver disorders, probabilistic causal modeling, diagnosis, medicine.
