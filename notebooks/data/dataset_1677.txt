QSAR-TID-12738 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12738. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September two thousand fifteen.

Matrix Metalloproteinase seven is a single protein, also known as Matrilysin, Matrin, Matrix Metalloproteinase seven, MMP seven, and MMP-seven. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M ten A subfamily.

Matrix Metalloproteinase seven is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis, extracellular matrix disassembly, extracellular matrix organization, positive regulation of cell migration, collagen catabolic process, and membrane protein intracellular domain proteolysis.

Keywords: QSAR, Matrix Metalloproteinase seven, MetaQSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, biological processes.
