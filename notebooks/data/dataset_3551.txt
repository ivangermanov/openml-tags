QSAR-TID-12913 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TIE-2, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TIE-2. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase TIE-2 is a single protein preferred name, also known as Angiopoietin-1 receptor, CD202b, Endothelial Tyrosine Kinase, hTIE2, p140 TEK. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase, and Tie family.

The dataset is related to Homo sapiens species group, and the protein target classification is enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase, and Tie family.
