QSAR-TID-100414 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred fourteen, and it has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was published in September two thousand fifteen. The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred fourteen. The features of the dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.
