Pulsars are a rare type of neutron star that produce radio emission detectable on earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter. 

As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, it produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus, pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes. 

Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation. Thus, a potential signal detection known as a candidate is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. 

In the absence of additional information, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However, in practice, almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find. 

Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. 

Here, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples are the majority negative class. At present, multi-class labels are unavailable due to the costs associated with data annotation. 

The dataset contains seventeen thousand nine hundred ninety-eight examples, including sixteen thousand two hundred fifty-nine spurious examples caused by radio frequency interference and noise, and one thousand six hundred thirty-nine real pulsar examples. 

Each example is described by eight continuous variables and a single class variable. The variables are derived from the integrated pulse profile and the DM-SNR curve.
