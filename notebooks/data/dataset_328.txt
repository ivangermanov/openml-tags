The bridges dataset, originally sourced from Pittsburgh bridges, is derived from version 2 (the discretized version) by removing all instances with missing values in the last (target) attribute. Although not initially designed as a classification dataset, it has been extensively used as such in literature, utilizing the last attribute as the target. To avoid confusion in benchmarking results, instances with missing values in this attribute have been removed.

The dataset comprises various properties of bridges, including both continuous/integer and nominal attributes. These properties encompass information such as the river on which the bridge is located, its construction date, purpose, length, number of lanes, clearance, type of construction, material used, span length, and relative length.

There are two versions of the database available: the original examples and descriptions after discretizing numeric properties. It's important to note that there are no predefined classes in this domain. Instead, it is considered a design domain where five properties (design description) need to be predicted based on seven specification properties.

The dataset contains missing values, which is a significant characteristic to consider when analyzing or working with the data. The attributes range from identifiers to specific bridge characteristics, providing a comprehensive overview of each structure.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in civil engineering, structural design, and related fields. It offers opportunities for various analyses, including predictive modeling, pattern recognition, and historical trends in bridge construction.
