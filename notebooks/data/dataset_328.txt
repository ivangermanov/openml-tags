Bridges
Tags: 

This version is derived from version two (the discretized version) by removing all instances with missing values in the last (target) attribute. The Bridges dataset is originally not a classification dataset, but it is used extensively in the literature, using the last attribute as the target attribute. However, this attribute has missing values, which may lead to confusing benchmarking results. Therefore, these instances have been removed.

Attribute Information:
The type field states whether a property is continuous/integer or nominal. For properties with continuous/integer and nominal types, the range of continuous numbers is given first, and the possible values of the nominal follow the semicolon.

Dataset Information
Additional Information
There are two versions to the database: one contains the original examples, and the other contains descriptions after discretizing numeric properties. There are no classes in the domain. Rather, this is a design domain where five properties (design description) need to be predicted based on seven specification properties.

Has Missing Values? Yes

Additional Variable Information
The type field states whether a property is continuous/integer or nominal. For properties with continuous/integer and nominal types, the range of continuous numbers is given first, and the possible values of the nominal follow the semicolon.
