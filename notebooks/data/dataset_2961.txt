The proposed forecasting approach is thoroughly examined and tested by utilizing the comprehensive database from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This approach employs a deep learning model that is founded on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and bidirectional gated recurrent unit features. These features comprise the following parameters: Year, Month, Day, Hour, Particulate Matter, Dew Point, Temperature, Cumulative Wind Bearing Direction, and Instantaneous Wind Speed.
