The Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities dataset was created to recognize human activities and postural transitions using smartphones. The experiment involved a group of volunteers who performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, and lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs, and walking upstairs). The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. All the participants wore a smartphone on their waist during the experiment execution.

The smartphone captured three-axial linear acceleration and three-axial angular velocity at a constant rate using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. The sensor signals were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows. The sensor acceleration signal was separated into body acceleration and gravity using a Butterworth low-pass filter. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

This dataset is an updated version of the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. This version provides the original raw inertial signals from the smartphone sensors, instead of the pre-processed signals provided in the previous version. The activity labels were also updated to include postural transitions that were not part of the previous version of the dataset.
