Credit G Seed Three Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the credit-g dataset, generated with a seed of three. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset to a manageable size. The dataset has ten classes, one hundred columns, and two thousand rows.

The subsampling process began by selecting classes. The unique classes in the dataset were identified, and if there were more than ten classes, a random sample of ten classes was selected. The indices where these classes were present were then selected, and the dataset was reduced to only include these indices.

Next, the columns were sampled. If the dataset had more than one hundred columns, a random sample of one hundred columns was selected. The columns were sorted, and the selected columns were used to reduce the dataset.

Finally, the rows were sampled. If the dataset had more than two thousand rows, a stratified sample of two thousand rows was selected. The stratification was based on the target variable, and the sample was shuffled to ensure randomness.

The resulting dataset has ten classes, one hundred columns, and two thousand rows. The dataset includes features such as checking status, duration, credit history, purpose, credit amount, savings status, employment, installment commitment, personal status, other parties, residence since, property magnitude, age, other payment plans, housing, existing credits, job, number of dependents, own telephone, foreign worker, and class.
