Subsampling of the dataset Credit-G with Seed equals Three 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters including seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to use stratification or not. 

It first uniformly samples classes from the unique values in the target variable, ensuring the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. 

Then, it selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses them to filter the input data and target variable. 

Next, it uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, selecting the specified number of columns randomly without replacement. 

Afterwards, if the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select the specified number of rows, ensuring the distribution of classes is preserved.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to strings, returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, target variable, and categorical mask.

Features include checking status, duration, credit history, purpose, credit amount, savings status, employment, installment commitment, personal status, other parties, residence since, property magnitude, age, other payment plans, housing, existing credits, job, number of dependents, own telephone, foreign worker, and class.
