Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

The dataset represents a binarized version of an original dataset, transforming a numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This transformation is achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature. Instances with target values below the mean are classified as positive ('P'), while those above the mean are classified as negative ('N'). This binary classification approach simplifies the original data structure, potentially making it more suitable for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks.

The source and date of the original dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper data provenance and documentation in research and data science. Users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately when used in their work, acknowledging its derivative nature from an earlier version.
