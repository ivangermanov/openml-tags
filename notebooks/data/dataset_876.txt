GINA Prior Datasets from the Agnostic Learning versus Prior Knowledge Challenge 

The GINA dataset is a digit recognition database. The task of GINA is handwritten digit recognition. For the prior knowledge track, we chose the problem of separating one-digit odd numbers from one-digit even numbers. 

The original pixel map representation is provided. This is a two-class classification problem with sparse continuous input variables, in which each class is composed of several clusters. It is a problem with heterogeneous classes.

Data Type: Non-Sparse
Number of Features: Seven Hundred Eighty Four
Number of Examples and Checksum: 
Training Set 
Validation Set 
This dataset contains samples from both training and validation datasets.

Features include various pixels representing different parts of the handwritten digits.
