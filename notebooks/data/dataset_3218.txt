QSAR-TID-30021 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30021. The dataset has ninety-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

The molecular fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
