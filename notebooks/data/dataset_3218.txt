QSAR-TID-30021 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30021. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset has ninety-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The target protein, Ephrin type-A receptor 4, is a single protein that belongs to the protein kinase group and tyrosine protein kinase family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, cell adhesion, and nervous system development.

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is involved in the development and function of the nervous system. It is also involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, and plays a role in the development of cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for the Ephrin type-A receptor 4 target.
