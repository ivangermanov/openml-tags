QSAR-TID-101130 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101130. It has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset was scraped from various sources, including Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, Guide to Pharmacology, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, and InterPro.

The scrapped data includes information about the protein target, such as its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. It also includes information about the protein's functions, processes, and relationships.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot, molecule ChEMBL ID, protein target classification, Gene Ontology, protein functions, protein processes.
