This dataset is the resulting cleaned version of the Risk of Being Drawn into Online Sex Work dataset.

Context
This database was used in a research paper titled "Covert Online Ethnography and Machine Learning for Detecting Individuals at Risk of Being Drawn into Online Sex Work". The paper explores the use of covert online ethnography and machine learning to identify individuals at risk of being drawn into online sex work.

Content
The database includes data scraped from a European online adult forum. Using covert online ethnography, researchers interviewed a small number of participants and determined their risk of either supplying or demanding sex services through that forum. This dataset is particularly useful for semi-supervised learning.

Acknowledgements
The dataset was initially made available by the research community.

Inspiration
The spread of online social media has enabled a greater number of people to become involved in online sex trade. However, detecting deviant behaviors online is limited by the low availability of data. To overcome this challenge, researchers combined covert online ethnography with semi-supervised learning using data from a popular European adult forum.

Features
The dataset includes user information, such as user ID, gender, age, location, and verification status. It also includes information about users' sexual preferences, online behavior, and social connections within the forum.
