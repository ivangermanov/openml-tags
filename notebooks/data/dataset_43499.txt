The Bechdel Cast Data Tags: Context

In the Bechdel Cast, the question asked is, do movies have women in them? Are all their discussions centered around boyfriends or husbands, or do they have individualism? The patriarchy's vast, and it's time to start changing it with the Bechdel Cast.

This dataset contains episode information for the comedy podcast, The Bechdel Cast, a feminist podcast that examines movies through a feminist lens. One of the ways the co-hosts examine movies is by seeing if it passes the Bechdel Test, which assesses whether a movie features at least two named female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. They also rate each movie at the end with a unique rating system, known as the Nipple Scale, to judge how well the movie represents women.

The dataset contains pertinent information such as the movie title, the weekly guest's name, the air date, the genre of the movie, whether it passed the Bechdel Test, and the Nipple Rating for each host and guest, as well as the average rating for the movie discussed in that episode.

The dataset features include episode information, air date, movie title, guest name, Bechdel Test result, and ratings from the hosts and guest.
