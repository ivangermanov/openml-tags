The QSAR-TID-103561 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103561. This dataset has forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets. The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103561.

The target protein is a single protein, specifically a G-protein coupled bile acid receptor one, also known as Gpbar one, M-BAR, or TGR five. This receptor is primarily found in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and membrane, and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and cell surface bile acid receptor signaling pathway.
