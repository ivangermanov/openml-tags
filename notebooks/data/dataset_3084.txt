QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the G protein coupled bile acid receptor, also known as Gpbar, M BAR, Membrane type receptor for bile acids, and Tgr. This receptor is found in Mus musculus and belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor and lipid like ligand receptor subfamilies.

The G protein coupled bile acid receptor is associated with various cellular components including the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and receptor complex. Its functions include G protein coupled receptor activity, bile acid receptor activity, and G protein coupled bile acid receptor activity. The receptor is involved in several biological processes such as signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, cell surface bile acid receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of ERK and ERK cascade, cellular response to bile acid, positive regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation, and regulation of bicellular tight junction assembly.

Cross references for this receptor can be found in various databases including ExpressionAtlas, GO Component, GO Function, GO Process, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. These references provide additional information on the receptor's structure, function, and interactions within biological systems.
