Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for binary classification of diabetes cases based on the calculated threshold. The dataset provides valuable insights into diabetes diagnosis and risk factors, enabling researchers to develop and test predictive models for early detection and intervention strategies. By simplifying the target variable, this binarized version facilitates easier interpretation and analysis of diabetes-related data.
