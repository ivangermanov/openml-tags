This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted as 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted as 'Negative'. The dataset includes three features: Age, Deficit, and Binary Class.
