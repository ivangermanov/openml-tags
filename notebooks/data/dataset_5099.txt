Timing Attack Dataset Created on September Twenty

This dataset contains information about Bleichenbacher Timing Attacks and has been categorized into three main sections: CCS0, TLS0, and DISC0/DISC1.

The CCS0 section includes attributes related to the first Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, such as source port, destination port, TCP sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags, window size, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, and timestamp values.

The TLS0 section includes attributes related to the first TLS Alert, such as source port, destination port, TCP sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags, window size, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, timestamp values, record content type, record length, alert message level, and alert message description.

The DISC0 and DISC1 sections include attributes related to the first and second TCP Disconnect, respectively, such as source port, destination port, TCP sequence number, acknowledgement number, header length, flags, window size, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, and timestamp values.

This dataset also includes a label feature, which indicates whether the data is vulnerable to certain types of attacks, including incorrect PKCS#1 padding, correctly formatted PKCS#1 PMS messages but one byte shorter, no zero bytes in the message, wrong first byte, and wrong second byte.
