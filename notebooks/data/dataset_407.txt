This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target. 

The dataset covers various aspects of drug design and chemical properties, including melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, ligand binding to receptors, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), toxicity prediction, biodegradability of compounds, and stability of protein modifications.

Data sources include studies on carbolenes, solid drug classification, neighborhood behavior in molecular diversity, general melting point prediction, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, QSAR analysis of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology benchmarking, toxicity and biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of chlorinated compounds, dehalogenation mechanisms, protein engineering, and antifilarial drug development.

The datasets utilize various molecular descriptors and statistical methods to model and predict chemical and biological properties relevant to drug design and development. These include physical properties, toxicity, biodegradability, receptor binding, and structure-activity relationships across diverse chemical classes and therapeutic targets.
