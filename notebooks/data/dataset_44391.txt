Name: House Sixteen H Seed Four

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset House Sixteen H with seed equal to four, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. The function first samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. Next, it samples the columns uniformly if required, selecting a specified number of columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it stratifies the data accordingly and splits it into a subset of the specified size. Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a new dataset with the sampled data.
