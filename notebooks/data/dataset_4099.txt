QSAR-TID-11802 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ABL is a single protein, also known as Abelson Murine Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 1, Abelson Tyrosine-Protein Kinase 1, Abl, and Abl1. It is a protein target classification of enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase Abl family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including neural tube closure, B-1 B cell homeostasis, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and DNA repair. It is also involved in various cellular components, including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion.

The protein has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, and protein kinase activity. It is also involved in various protein-protein interactions, including protein kinase C binding, protein binding, and SH3 domain binding.
