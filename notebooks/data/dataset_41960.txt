This dataset, tagged as Health and Social Media, represents crime reported to the Seattle Police Department. Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field.

This data is the same data used in meetings, such as SeaStat, for strategic planning, accountability, and performance management. It provides valuable insights into the types of crimes committed, when they occur, and where they happen within the city.

The data includes details about each incident, including the time it occurred, the time it was reported, the type of crime committed, and the location within the city. This information helps law enforcement officials identify trends and patterns, allocate resources effectively, and develop strategies to reduce crime.
