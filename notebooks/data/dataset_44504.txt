Name: Steel Plates Fault Dataset with Subsampling

Tags: Subsampling of the Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments.

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The subsampling process started by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling the unique classes present in the dataset, with a probability proportional to their frequency. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the samples that belonged to these classes.

Next, the columns of the dataset were subsampled. This was done by uniformly selecting a subset of columns from the original dataset. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset with the reduced set of features.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were subsampled. This was done using stratified sampling, where the samples were split into subsets based on their class labels, and then a random subset of samples was selected from each subset. This ensured that the resulting dataset had a balanced distribution of classes.

The resulting dataset has a reduced set of features and samples, making it more manageable for analysis and modeling.
