Name: Steel Plates Fault Seed One

Subsampling of the dataset Steel Plates Fault with Seed Equal to One 
Arguments include Number of Rows Maximum equals Two Thousand, 
Number of Columns Maximum equals One Hundred, 
Number of Classes Maximum equals Ten, 
and No Stratify equals False. 

Generated with the following source code:

A function named subsample takes in parameters such as seed, number of rows maximum, 
number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and whether it is stratified or not. 
It returns a dataset.

Within this function, a random number generator is created using the given seed.
The input data and target values are stored in variables x and y respectively.
Unique classes in the target values are found and stored in a variable called classes.
If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed number of classes,
then a specified number of classes are randomly selected based on their frequency,
and the corresponding indices are found and used to subset the input data and target values.
If the number of columns in the input data exceeds the maximum allowed number of columns,
then a specified number of column indices are randomly selected and used to subset the input data.
If the number of rows in the input data exceeds the maximum allowed number of rows,
then the input data and target values are concatenated and split into two subsets 
using a stratified sampling approach with the specified number of rows as the test size.
Finally, the dataset is returned with the subsampled input data, target values, 
categorical mask, and column names.
