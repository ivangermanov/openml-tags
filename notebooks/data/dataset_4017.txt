QSAR-TID-11110 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Eight, and it has a large number of rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Eight. Matrix Metalloproteinase Eight is a single protein, also known as Neutrophil Collagenase, and it belongs to the Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAM clan/Metallo protease M ten A subfamily.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and other applications.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Eight is a protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including proteolysis, extracellular matrix disassembly, and collagen catabolic process. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation, and inflammation.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It can be used to develop predictive models for Matrix Metalloproteinase Eight inhibitors and to identify potential drug candidates.
