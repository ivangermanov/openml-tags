QSAR-TID-11110 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11110. It has a total of nine hundred sixty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biobia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, and many more.

This dataset was part of the metaqsar project and was published in september two thousand fifteen.

Matrix metalloproteinase eight is a single protein preferred name, also known as clg one matrix metalloproteinase eight mmp eight mmp minus eight neutrophil collagenase.

It belongs to the enzyme protease metallo protease mam clan metallo protease m ten a subfamily.

Matrix metalloproteinase eight is involved in many biological processes including proteolysis, positive regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of gene expression, extracellular matrix disassembly, and many more.

It has been shown to have an impact on various diseases including cancer, inflammatory disorders, and neurological disorders.

Some molecules have been found to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase eight, including cts minus one zero two seven and rebimastat.
