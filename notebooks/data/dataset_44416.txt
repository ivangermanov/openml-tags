Name: MiniBooNE Seed Four with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset MiniBooNE with seed equal to four, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset by uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows. It first selects classes, then columns, and finally rows. The selection of classes and rows is stratified, meaning that the proportion of each class is maintained. The selection of columns is uniform.

The function takes in a dataset, a seed for random number generation, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.
