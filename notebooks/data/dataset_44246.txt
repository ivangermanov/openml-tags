**Meta Album RESISC Dataset (Micro)**

The RESISC dataset gathers seven hundred RGB images of size two hundred fifty-six by two hundred fifty-six pixels for each of forty-five scene categories. The data authors strive to provide a challenging dataset by increasing both within-class diversity and between-class similarity, as well as integrating many image variations. Even though RESISC does not propose a label hierarchy, it can be created from other common aerial image label organization schemes. We have preprocessed RESISC for Meta Album by resizing the dataset to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels.
