The Three-Dimensional Location Estimation Using Received Signal Strength Indication of Wireless Local Area Network Dataset aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning-based localization algorithm that can accurately estimate the position of a receiver based on Received Signal Strength Information from surrounding radio transmitters, including height information, thus enabling the estimation of the target's three-dimensional location.

This challenge focuses on creating a robust algorithm that utilizes data from various sources, including latitude, longitude, and signal strength, to pinpoint the exact location of a device in a three-dimensional space. By leveraging machine learning techniques, participants will strive to develop a model that can effectively process and analyze large datasets, taking into account factors such as signal frequency, channel, and receiver height, to provide accurate location estimates.
