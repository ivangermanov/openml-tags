Churn occurs when customers abandon their current service provider and switch to a different one. This poses a significant business challenge because acquiring new customers is more costly than retaining existing ones who might otherwise defect. Customer retention is crucial for companies to maintain a loyal customer base and avoid the expenses associated with finding and acquiring new clients.
