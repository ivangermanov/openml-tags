QSAR-TID-227 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 227, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. 

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It consists of multiple compounds with their corresponding activity values and molecular fingerprints.

The serotonin 2b receptor, also known as the 5-HT2B receptor, is a type of G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in various physiological processes including neural crest cell migration, heart development, and smooth muscle contraction.

It is a single protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is classified under the monoamine receptor subgroup. 

Some of the compounds that interact with this receptor include PRX-08066, VABICASERIN, METHYLERGONOVINE, and METHYSERGIDE, which have different mechanisms of action and have been approved for different indications.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, neurotransmission, and regulation of behavior, and it interacts with other proteins and molecules to regulate these processes.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, serotonin 2b receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, neurotransmission, behavior regulation.
