This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one fourteen two seven, and it has one hundred sixty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
