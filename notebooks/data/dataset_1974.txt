The QSAR-TID-11843 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, tagged as Machine Learning and MTLQSAR, specifically designed for study three.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11843. It comprises eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The generating fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes various features, such as MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four one, and so on, up to FCFP six one hundred twenty-four ninety-eight, among others.
