The Vehicle dataset aims to classify vehicle silhouettes into one of four types based on features extracted from the silhouette. Vehicles may be viewed from various angles. This classification problem originated from research conducted in the late s at the Turing Institute, partially funded by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The goal was to develop a method for distinguishing D objects within D images by applying shape feature extractors to object silhouettes.

The dataset comprises silhouettes of four model vehicles: a double decker bus, Chevrolet van, Saab , and an Opel Manta . These vehicles were chosen to provide a mix of easily distinguishable and more challenging classifications. Images were captured using a camera positioned at a fixed angle above the models, which were placed on a backlit surface and painted matte black to minimize highlights.

The image capture process involved rotating the vehicles through  degrees, with multiple sets of images taken at different camera elevations. The resulting images were processed to produce binary silhouettes and cleaned to remove noise. Features were then extracted using the Hierarchical Image Processing System (HIPS) extension BINATTS, which combines scale independent features based on classical moments and heuristic measures.

Attributes extracted include compactness, circularity, distance circularity, radius ratio, principal axis aspect ratio, maximum length aspect ratio, scatter ratio, elongatedness, principal axis rectangularity, maximum length rectangularity, scaled variances along major and minor axes, scaled radius of gyration, skewness and kurtosis about major and minor axes, and hollows ratio.

The dataset contains examples divided into four classes: Opel, Saab, Bus, and Van. It has attributes, all of which are numerical features derived from the silhouette images. The classification task involves distinguishing between these vehicle types based on the extracted shape features.

This dataset has been used in various studies and is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It presents an interesting challenge in object recognition and classification, particularly in distinguishing between similar vehicle types from different viewing angles.
