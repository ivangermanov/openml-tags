QSAR-TID-11261 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11261. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The drug target, Somatostatin Receptor Three, is a single protein that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is primarily involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including cell growth and differentiation, hormone secretion, and neurotransmission.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, pituitary gland, and pancreas, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of hormone secretion and cell growth. It is also involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting Somatostatin Receptor Three. The data can be used to develop predictive models of drug activity and to identify potential lead compounds for further optimization.
