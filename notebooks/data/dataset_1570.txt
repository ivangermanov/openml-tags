QSAR-TID-12345 Dataset 

Demographics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12345. It has forty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features: molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other features representing FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
