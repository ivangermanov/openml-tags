Subsampling of the dataset Albert with seed equals three, argument number rows equals two thousand, argument number columns equals one hundred, argument number classes equals ten, and argument no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters including seed, maximum number rows, maximum number columns, maximum number classes, and whether to use stratification or not. It returns a dataset.

Within the function, it first sets up a random number generator using the given seed. Then, it gets the unique classes from the target variable y. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects a subset of classes based on their frequency distribution. It then filters the data to only include instances belonging to the selected classes.

Next, if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, it randomly selects a subset of columns. Otherwise, it uses all columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it performs stratified sampling to select a subset of instances. Finally, it returns a new dataset with the sampled data and corresponding metadata.

Features include various variables from one to seventy eight, as well as the class label.
