The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded according to their characteristics, specifically the degree of colinearity and the number of samples and features.

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, with a normalized noise added to the output. This function is particularly useful for generating data with complex relationships.

To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. Additionally, to measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity. Colinearity refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in their parameters, including the number of features, which ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output. The remaining features are randomly generated and unrelated to the output. The number of samples also varies, ranging from one hundred to one thousand.

Furthermore, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity, specifically zero to four. For datasets with a high degree of colinearity, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
