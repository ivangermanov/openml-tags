Incident reports from the San Francisco Police Department between January two thousand three and May two thousand eighteen, provided by the City and County of San Francisco. The dataset was downloaded on eleventh of May two thousand eighteen from https://data.sfgov.org/Public Safety/Police Department Incident Reports Historical two thousand three/tmnf yvry. For a description of all variables, check out the homepage of the data provider. The original data was published under Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License. 

As target, the binary variable Violent Crime was created. A Violent Crime was defined as Category being Assault, Robbery, Sex Offenses Forcible, or Kidnapping or Descript being Grand Theft Purse Snatch or Attempted Grand Theft Purse Snatch. Additional date and time features Hour, Day of Week, Month, and Year were created. The original variables Category, Descript, Date, Time, Resolution, Location, and Police Id were removed from the dataset. One record which contained the only missing value in the variable Police District was removed from the dataset.

Using this dataset for machine learning was inspired by the concept of impact coding of categorical variables with many levels. Note that incidents consist of multiple rows in the dataset when the crime belongs to more than one Category, which is indicated by the Id variable Incident Number ignored by default. For this version, the majority class was down sampled to achieve a balanced classification task. Unused factor levels were dropped. The numeric features X and Y were removed to increase the importance of the high cardinal factorial features.
