QSAR-TID-237 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 237. The dataset has five hundred and ten rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand and twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Leukotriene A four hydrolase, and it has five hundred and ten rows and one thousand and twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

Leukotriene A four hydrolase is a single protein target, also known as Leukotriene A four hydrolase, Leukotriene A hydrolase, LTA four, LTA four H, LTA hydrolase. It is an enzyme that belongs to the metallo protease MAE clan and metallo protease M one family. It is involved in the metabolism of leukotrienes, which are potent lipid mediators of inflammation.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening. The project is a collaborative effort to collect, curate, and share QSAR data and models for a wide range of biological targets.
