Ailerons 
Tags: Economics, Machine Learning 

This dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark. It addresses a control problem, specifically flying an F sixteen aircraft. The attributes describe the status of the airplane, while the goal is to predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft. 

The dataset consists of various features that characterize the plane's status, including its climbing rate, speed, pitch, roll, and other relevant parameters. These features are essential in predicting the necessary control actions to ensure safe and efficient flight operations.

The dataset has been transformed in the same way as the tabular data benchmark available on GitHub.
