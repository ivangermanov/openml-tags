Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion was originally performed by a data scientist.

Features: Film, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Reviewer, is associated with mythbusting and study tags. It represents a modified version of an original dataset, where the target feature has been transformed from multiple classes into a binary classification. The majority class is designated as positive, while all other classes are grouped as negative. This binarization process simplifies the classification task, potentially making it more suitable for certain types of analysis or machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes information about films and their corresponding binary classification. Researchers and data analysts interested in film studies or binary classification problems may find this dataset particularly useful for their work.
