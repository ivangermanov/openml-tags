The Street View House Numbers Dataset is a real-world image dataset designed for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirements on data preprocessing and formatting. Similar in flavor to MNIST, this dataset incorporates a significantly larger amount of labeled data and originates from a much harder, unsolved, real-world problem â€“ recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images.

Obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images, this dataset consists of ten classes, one for each digit. Each digit has a corresponding label, with digit one having label one, digit nine having label nine, and digit zero having label ten. The data is presented in a MNIST-like format of thirty-two by thirty-two RGB images centered around a single digit, often containing distractors at the sides.

This dataset provides a unique opportunity for researchers to develop and test their machine learning models in a realistic setting, without requiring extensive data preprocessing or formatting efforts. With its large size and challenging nature, the Street View House Numbers Dataset offers a valuable resource for advancing the field of object recognition and machine learning.
