QSAR-TID-12396 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12396. The dataset has ninety-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it provides a valuable resource for researchers working in this area.

The features of the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing the structure of a molecule as a binary string. This allows for the comparison and analysis of different molecules, and it is a powerful tool in the field of QSAR.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR, and it has the potential to contribute to the development of new drugs and treatments.
