QSAR-TID-11089 Dataset: Agriculture, Images, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11089. The data has twenty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about a single protein, specifically caspase four, which is a cysteine protease enzyme. It is involved in various biological processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and defense responses.

Caspase four is expressed in different cellular locations, such as the cytoplasm, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane. It performs various functions, including lipopolysaccharide binding, protein binding, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.

The dataset also provides information about the gene ontology classification of caspase four, including its role in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions.

Additionally, the dataset includes information from various databases, such as Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, and UniProt.

Keywords: QSAR, caspase four, cysteine protease, apoptosis, inflammation, defense responses, gene ontology, biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions.
