Acute Inflammations Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

Abstract:
The data was created by a medical expert as a dataset to test the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of the urinary system. 

Data Set Information:
The primary goal of this dataset is to prepare the algorithm of the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. It will serve as an example of diagnosing acute inflammations of urinary bladder and acute nephritises.

For better comprehension of the problem, let us consider definitions of both diseases provided by medical professionals. Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterized by the sudden occurrence of pains in the abdominal region and the urination in the form of constant urine pushing, micturition pains, and sometimes a lack of urine retention. The body temperature is rising; however, it most often does not exceed thirty-eight degrees Celsius. The excreted urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms typically decay within several days. However, there is an inclination to relapses. At individuals with acute inflammation of urinary bladder, we should anticipate that the illness will transform into a protracted form.

Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs significantly more frequently at women than at men. It commences with sudden fever, which reaches and sometimes exceeds forty degrees Celsius. The fever is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-sided lumbar pains, which are occasionally very intense. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear quite frequently. Rather often, there are also nausea and vomiting and widespread pains of the entire abdomen.

Attribute Lines:
Each instance represents a potential patient. Each line of the data file initiates with a digit indicating the temperature of the patient. 

Attribute Information:
Temperature of Patient - ranges from thirty-five to forty-two degrees Celsius
Occurrence of Nausea - yes or no
Lumbar Pain - yes or no
Urine Pushing (Continuous Need for Urination) - yes or no
Micturition Pains - yes or no
Burning of Urethra, Itch, Swelling of Urethra Outlet - yes or no
Decision: Inflammation of Urinary Bladder - yes or no
Decision: Nephritis of Renal Pelvis Origin - yes or no
