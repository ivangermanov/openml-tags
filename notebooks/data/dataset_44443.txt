Name: Cover Type Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type with seed equal to zero

This dataset is a subsample of the original Cover Type dataset. It was generated using a specific source code that involves random sampling of classes, columns, and rows. The sampling was done in a stratified manner to ensure that the resulting dataset is representative of the original dataset.

The dataset features a selection of variables, including Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Horizontal Distance to Hydrology, Vertical Distance to Hydrology, Horizontal Distance to Roadways, Hillshade at nine am, Hillshade at noon, Hillshade at three pm, Horizontal Distance to Fire Points, and Wilderness Area. It also includes various Soil Types.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows. The classes were sampled based on their frequency in the original dataset, and the columns were sampled uniformly. The rows were sampled in a stratified manner to ensure that the resulting dataset has the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a specific number of rows, columns, and classes. It was generated using a random seed of zero, which ensures reproducibility of the results.
