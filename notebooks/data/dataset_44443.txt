Cover Type Seed Zero with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, One Hundred Columns, and Stratification Enabled

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Cover Type dataset, featuring two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns, with stratification enabled.

The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that all chosen classes were represented proportionally. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, retaining only the relevant instances.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to reduce the feature space to one hundred columns. This step helped to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and improve model performance.

Finally, the dataset was further subsampled to meet the two-thousand-row limit, while maintaining the class balance using stratification.
