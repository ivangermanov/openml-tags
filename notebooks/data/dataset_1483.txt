QSAR-TID-11142 Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11142, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It is essential to cite this dataset when using it for any purpose.

This dataset shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11142. It has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. 

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
