Localization Data for Person Activity Dataset

This dataset contains recordings of five individuals performing various activities while wearing four sensors (tags) placed on their ankles, belt, and chest. Each person repeated the same scenario five times. The data was collected at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

The dataset provides localization data for each tag, with each instance representing a specific tag's position. Tags can be identified by one of the attributes in the data. The activities recorded include walking, falling, lying down, sitting down, standing up from various positions, and being on all fours.

Attributes in the dataset include:

- Sequence Name: Identifies the person and repetition
- Tag Identifier: Specifies the location of the tag (ankle left, ankle right, chest, or belt)
- Timestamp: Unique numeric value
- Date: Formatted as day.month.year hour:minute:second:millisecond
- X, Y, Z coordinates: Numeric values representing the tag's position
- Activity: The action being performed at the time of recording

The data does not contain any missing values. It was created to support research in ambient intelligence and independent living care. The dataset can be used to study human activity recognition, localization techniques, and potentially concept drift in movement patterns over time.

This dataset is valuable for researchers working on agent-based approaches to care in independent living environments, as well as those studying human movement patterns and activity recognition using wearable sensors.
