The CNAE Nine dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of arguments to generate a new dataset. This process involved setting a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, and maximum number of classes, as well as determining whether to use stratification.

The resulting dataset contains a selection of features, including variables two, four, twenty-five, and so on. The original dataset had more features, but they were uniformly sampled down to the maximum allowed number.

To ensure representativeness, the classes were also uniformly sampled, with probabilities based on their frequency in the original dataset. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, reducing the number of rows to the maximum allowed.

Further sampling was done to reduce the number of columns, again using uniform sampling without replacement. The resulting dataset has a specified number of rows, columns, and classes, and maintains the stratification of the original dataset.

This subsampling process allows for a more manageable dataset while preserving the essential characteristics of the original data.
