QSAR-TID-10620
Tags: Earth Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10620. It has sixty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit one, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit two, and so on.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it for your research purposes.

The target protein is Serotonin Two-A Receptor, also known as Five-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor Two-A, Five-HT-Two-A, Five-HT-Two, HTR Two, HTR Two-A. It belongs to the species Mus Musculus, and its classification is One Membrane Receptor Family A G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Small Molecule Receptor Family A GPCR Monoamine Receptor Serotonin Receptor.

This protein is responsible for various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, glycolytic process, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, signal transduction, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and many others.
