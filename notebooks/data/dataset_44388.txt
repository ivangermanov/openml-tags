Name: House Sixteen H Seed One

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset House Sixteen H with seed equals one, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, arguments ncols max equals one hundred, arguments nclasses max equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the dataset. It first samples the classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it samples the columns uniformly if required, selecting a specified number of columns randomly. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it stratifies the data accordingly and splits it into a subset of the specified size.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
