The ChSCase Census Four dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. This means that the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset belongs to the categories of Chemistry and Life Science studies.

Features include several columns of data.

Binary Class is a key aspect of this dataset.
