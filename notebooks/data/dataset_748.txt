This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It involves converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion process involves calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset consists of several key features, including Grievances, Rotation, Labor Union, Workforce, and Logarithmic Workforce Size. The binary class feature categorizes instances as either Positive or Negative.
