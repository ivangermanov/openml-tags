Name: Analcatdata Wildcat

Tags: Mythbusting, Study

Source: Unknown - Date unknown

Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Grievances, Rotate, Union, Workforce, Log workforce, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Wildcat, is associated with mythbusting and various studies. The original source and date of creation are unknown. It is important to note that this version is a binarized adaptation of an earlier dataset. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification system. This was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P'), while those above were labeled as negative ('N'). The dataset includes several features such as grievances, rotation, union involvement, workforce size, logarithmic workforce representation, and a binary classification. Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset are encouraged to provide appropriate citation when referencing or using this information in their work.
