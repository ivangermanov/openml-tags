Description:

The Effects of the Growth Regulators Paclobutrazol and Flurprimidol on the Number and Length of Internodes in Terminal Sprouts Formed on Trimmed Silver Maple Trees.

Introduction:

The trimming of trees under distribution lines on city streets and in rural areas is a major problem and expense for electrical utilities. Such operations are routinely performed at intervals of one to eight years depending upon the individual species growth rate and the amount of clearance required. Much effort has been spent in developing chemicals for the horticultural industry to retard the growth of woody and herbaceous plants. Recently, a group of new growth regulators was introduced which was shown to be effective in controlling the growth of trees without producing noticeable injury symptoms. In this group are Paclobutrazol, commonly known as PP 333, and Flurprimidol, commonly known as EL-500. Both EL-500 and PP-333 have been reported to control excessive sprout growth in a number of species when applied as a foliar spray, as a soil drench, or by trunk injection.

Sprout length is a function of both the number of internodes and the length of the individual internodes in the sprout. While there have been many reports that both PP 333 and EL-500 cause a reduction in the length of internodes formed in sprouts on woody plants treated with the growth regulators, there has been but one report that EL-500 application to apple trees resulted in a reduction of the number of internodes formed per sprout. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the length of the terminal sprouts, the length of the individual internodes in those sprouts, and the number of internodes in trimmed silver maple trees following trunk injection with the growth regulators PP 333 and EL-500.

Experimental Details:

Multistemmed twelve-year-old silver maple trees growing at Wesleyville, Ontario were trunk injected with methanolic solutions of EL-500 and PP-333 in May of nineteen eighty-five using a third-generation tree injector. Two different application rates were used for each chemical. The volume of solution, and hence the amount of active ingredient, injected into each tree was determined from the diameter of the tree, using the formula. Two sets of control trees were included in the experiment. In one set, trees received no injection, and in a second set, the trees were injected with methanol, the carrier in the growth regulator solutions. Ten trees, chosen at random, were used in each of the control and experimental sets. Prior to injection, all the trees were trimmed by a forestry crew, with their heights being reduced by about one-third. In January nineteen eighty-seven, twenty months after the trees were injected, between six and eight limbs were removed at random from the bottom two-thirds of the canopy of each of the ten trees in each experimental and control set.

Data Set:

Each of the records represents a terminal sprout and contains the following information: Sprout Number, Treatment, Tree ID, Branch ID, Total Sprout Length, Number of Internodes on the Sprout, and a list of the lengths of the internodes in the sprout, starting from the base of the sprout.
