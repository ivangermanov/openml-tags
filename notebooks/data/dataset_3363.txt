QSAR-TID-19905 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19905. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project, which was conducted in September 2015, generated these Fingerprints, which do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains a wide range of features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 features.

The dataset is related to the Melanin-concentrating Hormone Receptor 1, which is a Single Protein and a G-Protein Coupled Receptor. It is also known as GPR24, MCH1R, MCH-1R, and MCHR. The receptor is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as a Membrane Receptor, Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor, Peptide Receptor, and Short Peptide Receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including the generation of precursor metabolites and energy, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of feeding behavior and the positive regulation of calcium ion transport.

The receptor has been studied in various contexts, including the Expression Atlas, Go Component, Go Function, and Go Process. It has also been linked to various diseases and disorders, including obesity and metabolic disorders.
