PAR Ten Performances of Modern Solvers on the Solvable Instances of MIPLIB Two Thousand Ten.

The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the Twelve Threads table of the evaluations.

The features were generated using the Mixed Integer Programming Feature Computation Code from the University of British Columbia.

To record run times of the feature computations, Run Solver was used.

Part of the Open Algorithm Challenge Two Thousand Seventeen, also known as Mira.
