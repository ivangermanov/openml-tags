**Diabetes Bayesian Network. Sample Five**

This Bayesian network repository reference is categorized under bnlearn, diabetes, life science, machine learning, and sample.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network is a large-scale network consisting of numerous nodes and arcs. It has a substantial number of parameters, which indicates its complexity.

In terms of structure, the average Markov blanket size is approximately four, while the average degree is nearly three. The maximum in-degree is two.

This network model was developed to approach insulin adjustment through a model-based methodology.

Features of this network include meal, CHO, CHO initial, insulin absorption, active insulin, insulin sensitivity, gut absorption, blood glucose, renal clearance, insulin independent utility, insulin dependent utility, glucose production, insulin independent, insulin dependent, endogenous balance, CHO balance, basal balance, total balance, metabolic irritation, and many others.
