The California dataset has been subsampled with a seed of two, resulting in a new dataset with a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. This subsampling process was performed using a uniform sampling method for both classes and columns. 

The original California dataset had over forty-four thousand entries, but this new subsampled version has been significantly reduced in size while still maintaining a representative selection of the original data. The goal of this subsampling process was to create a more manageable dataset for analysis and modeling purposes.

The features included in this subsampled dataset include Median Income, House Age, Average Rooms, Average Bedrooms, Population, Average Occupancy, Latitude, Longitude, and Price.
