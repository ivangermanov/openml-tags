Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Cover Type dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a random seed of four, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, a maximum number of classes of ten, and stratification enabled. 

The generation process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting the indices where one of these classes is present, and then uniformly sampling columns if required. The resulting dataset has undergone some transformations, including converting categorical columns to strings for OpenML compatibility.
