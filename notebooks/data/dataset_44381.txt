Name: Cover Type Seed Four with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type with seed equals four, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals false. 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. 

First, it samples the classes uniformly, selecting the indices where one of the chosen classes is present. Then, it samples the columns uniformly if required. 

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly, using the target name, and splits the data into a subset of the desired size. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string for OpenML, and returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and columns.
