Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version 1). This dataset converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on low birth weight and related factors. It has been processed to create a binary classification problem, making it suitable for various statistical and machine learning analyses. The original continuous target variable has been transformed into two distinct categories based on the mean value, allowing for easier interpretation and modeling of outcomes.

The features included in this dataset cover a range of maternal and pregnancy-related characteristics that may influence birth weight. These include maternal age, weight, race, smoking status, history of premature labor, hypertension, uterine irritability, and number of physician visits during the first trimester. The binary class feature serves as the target variable for predictive modeling.

This binarized version of the dataset provides researchers and data scientists with a simplified approach to studying factors associated with low birth weight, enabling the development and testing of classification algorithms and statistical models in this important area of public health research.
