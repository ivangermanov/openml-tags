QSAR-TID-103101 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103101. The dataset has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103101. The features of the dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Uracil nucleotide/cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, which is a single protein preferred name. The receptor is also known by several synonyms, including GPR seventeen, G-protein coupled receptor seventeen, P two Y-like receptor R twelve, and UDP/CysLT receptor. The receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, inflammatory response, and oligodendrocyte differentiation.
