At Santander, our mission is to help individuals and businesses thrive financially. We continuously strive to assist our customers in understanding their financial well-being and identifying which products and services could aid them in achieving their monetary objectives.

Our data science team persistently challenges our machine learning algorithms, collaborating with the global data science community to ensure we can more accurately identify novel approaches to solving our most common challenge, namely binary classification problems such as determining whether a customer is satisfied, predicting if a customer will purchase a particular product, and assessing whether a customer can repay a loan.

The Santander Customer Satisfaction dataset comprises various features, including customer identification codes and transactional variables. By leveraging these features, we aim to develop more effective predictive models capable of enhancing our customer-centric approach.
