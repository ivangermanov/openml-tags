QSAR-TID-101503 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101503. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101503. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the NUAK family SNF1-like kinase two, which is a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.

The dataset contains information about the protein target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The protein target is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, and is part of the CAMK protein kinase group and CAMK protein kinase NuaK subfamily.

The dataset also contains information about the protein's function, including its role in nucleotide-activated protein kinase complex, protein phosphorylation, and regulation of hippo signaling. Additionally, the dataset provides information about the protein's process, including its role in apoptotic process, protein localization to nucleus, and negative regulation of TOR signaling.
