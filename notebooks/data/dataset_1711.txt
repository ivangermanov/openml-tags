QSAR-TID-20171 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20171. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project was created in September two thousand fifteen. This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: two thousand one hundred seventy-one.

Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Aurora-C is a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as AIE two, AIK three, AIRK three, ARK three, ARK-three, and others. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens and has a description relationship accession of Aurora kinase C Single Protein.

ChEMBL ID Relationship Pref Name Target Type includes ChEMBL three four three zero nine one one, which is a superset of Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Aurora Protein Family. Another example is ChEMBL four one zero six one four one, which is a superset of Aurora-C INCENP Protein Complex.
