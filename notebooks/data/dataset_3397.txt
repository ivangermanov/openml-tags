QSAR-TID-12703 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12703. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on Tryptase beta-1, a single protein target that belongs to the Enzyme/Protease/Serine protease/Serine protease PA clan/Serine protease S1A subfamily.

Tryptase beta-1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including proteolysis, defense response, and extracellular matrix disassembly. It is expressed in Homo sapiens and has been implicated in several diseases.

The dataset contains multiple features that describe the molecular properties of the compounds, including their molecular fingerprints. These features can be used to develop predictive models of Tryptase beta-1 activity, which can aid in the discovery of new drugs that target this protein.
