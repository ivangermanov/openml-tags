This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-101182, falls under the categories of Economics and MTLQSAR, and is part of the MetaQSAR project from September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101182. There are eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint features, and median pseudo-pCI fifty. 

Scraped data includes information about the protein target, specifically myosin light chain kinase family member four, also known as MYLK four, SgK zero eighty-five, or Sugen kinase eighty-five. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CAMK protein kinase group, and CAMK protein kinase MLCK family.

Keywords: QSAR, MTLQSAR, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, myosin light chain kinase, protein kinase, CAMK protein kinase.
