Child Bayesian Network. Sample Six.

This Bayesian network repository is a discrete medium-sized network that represents a Child Bayesian Network. It has been referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository.

The Child Bayesian Network consists of twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with two hundred thirty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is three, while the average degree is two point five. The maximum in-degree is two.

The Child Bayesian Network is a well-known benchmark for machine learning and life science applications. It is widely used to test and evaluate the performance of various algorithms and models.

The network features several variables related to a child's health, including aspects of cardiac mixing, disease, lung flow, and oxygen levels.
