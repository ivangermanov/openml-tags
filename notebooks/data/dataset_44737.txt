Name: Volkert Seed Four Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Volkert with seed four, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its characteristics. It takes in a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. 

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are present in the resulting dataset. It then uniformly samples columns from the dataset, selecting a specified number of columns. 

If the dataset has more rows than the specified maximum, the function stratifies the sampling according to the target variable, ensuring that the resulting dataset has the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. 

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
