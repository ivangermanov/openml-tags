The Hyperplane dataset is a concept drift stream generator that produces high-dimensional classification problems. The prediction is defined by a rotating hyperplane, which changes its orientation and position over time in a smooth manner, introducing smooth concept drift. This version of the dataset is created using the MOA library with drift parameters that control the magnitude of change after every instance within a window. The probability of reversing the change direction is fixed. The dataset contains instances with numeric features. Noise is added by randomly changing the class labels.
