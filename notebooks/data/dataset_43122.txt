The Rotating Hyperplane dataset is a stream generator designed to produce high-dimensional classification problems where the prediction is defined by a rotating hyperplane. This unique feature enables the introduction of smooth concept drift, achieved by gradually changing the orientation and position of the hyperplane over time. 

This particular version was created using the MOA library, incorporating specific drift parameters to control the magnitude of change after each instance within a designated window. The probability of reversing the change direction remains fixed, ensuring a consistent pattern throughout. 

The dataset comprises an impressive number of instances, featuring ten numeric attributes and a class label. To simulate real-world scenarios, a small percentage of noise has been intentionally added by randomly altering the class labels.

Features include attributes one through ten, as well as a class label.
