Dataset Information:

This educational dataset is collected from a learning management system called Kalboard 360, which is a multi-agent system designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. The system provides users with synchronous access to educational resources from any device with an internet connection. The data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool called Experience API (xAPI), which is a component of the Training and Learning Architecture (TLA) that enables the monitoring of learning progress and learners' actions, such as reading an article or watching a training video. The Experience API helps learning activity providers determine the learner, activity, and objects that describe a learning experience.

The dataset consists of 480 student records and 16 features, which are classified into three major categories: demographic features, academic background features, and behavioral features. The demographic features include gender and nationality. The academic background features include educational stage, grade level, and section. The behavioral features include raised hand on class, opening resources, answering surveys by parents, and school satisfaction.

The dataset includes students from different origins, including Kuwait, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, USA, Iran, Libya, Morocco, and Venezuela. The dataset is collected through two educational semesters.

The data set includes a new category of features, which is parent participation in the educational process. Parent participation features have two sub-features: Parent Answering Survey and Parent School Satisfaction.
