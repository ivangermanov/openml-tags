Students Academic Performance Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is an educational collection gathered from a learning management system called Kalboard 360. Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent learning management system, designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. It provides users with synchronous access to educational resources from any device with an internet connection. The data was collected using a learner activity tracker tool, known as Experience API. This API is a component of the Training and Learning Architecture that enables monitoring of learning progress and learners' actions, such as reading an article or watching a training video. 

The dataset consists of 16 features, categorized into three major groups: demographic features, academic background features, and behavioral features. The demographic features include gender and nationality. The academic background features include educational stage, grade level, and section. The behavioral features include raising hands on class, opening resources, answering surveys by parents, and school satisfaction.

The dataset contains 480 student records, with 305 male students and 175 female students. The students come from various nationalities, including Kuwait, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, USA, Iran, Libya, Morocco, and Venezuela. The dataset was collected over two educational semesters, with 245 student records gathered during the first semester and 235 student records gathered during the second semester.

The dataset includes a feature on school attendance, where students are classified into two categories based on their absence days. Additionally, it includes a new category of features related to parent participation in the educational process. This feature has two sub-features: parent answering surveys and parent school satisfaction.

The attributes included in the dataset are:

* Student's gender 
* Student's nationality 
* Student's place of birth 
* Educational level student belongs to 
* Grade student belongs to 
* Classroom student belongs to 
* Course topic 
* School year semester 
* Parent responsible for student 
* How many times the student raises their hand on class 
* How many times the student visits a course content 
* How many times the student checks new announcements 
* How many times the student participates in discussion groups 
* Whether the parent answered the surveys provided by the school 
* The degree of parent satisfaction from the school 
* The number of absence days for each student 

The students are classified into three numerical intervals based on their total grade/mark: low-level, middle-level, and high-level.
