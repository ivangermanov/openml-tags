This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, which is a single protein preferred name known as PITSLRE Serine-Threonine-Protein Kinase CDC two L one. The synonyms for this target include CDC two L one, CDK eleven, CDK eleven B, Cell Division Cycle two-like Protein Kinase one, and Cell Division Protein Kinase eleven B.

The organism associated with this target is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group known as No Protein Target Classification. The description for this target includes Cyclin-Dependent Kinase eleven B, which is a single protein.

The dataset also contains information about the expression atlas, gene ontology components, functions, and processes. The gene ontology components include cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The gene ontology functions include nucleotide binding, RNA binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine-threonine kinase activity, and others.

The gene ontology processes include mitotic cell cycle, regulation of cell growth, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, and others. Additionally, the dataset contains information about the Wikipedia entry, canSAR-target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, and UniProt.
