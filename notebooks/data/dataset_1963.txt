This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred two thousand three hundred ninety-nine, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty.

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, molecular fingerprint features, and many others.
