QSAR-TID-17089 Dataset Information

The QSAR-TID-17089 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17089. This dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

Features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides information about the Retinoid X Receptor Beta, a single protein preferred name with synonyms such as Nuclear Receptor Coregulator One, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Two, Rcor-One, Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-Beta.

Organism information includes Rattus Norvegicus species group and protein target classification as Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Two.

Description relationship accession information includes Retinoic Acid Receptor RXR-Beta, Single Protein, and P49743.

Component information includes nucleus, cytoplasm, and RNA Polymerase Two Transcription Regulator Complex.

Function information includes transcription cis-regulatory region binding, RNA Polymerase Two Transcription Regulatory Region Sequence-Specific DNA Binding, DNA-Binding Transcription Activator Activity, RNA Polymerase Two-Specific, DNA binding, DNA-Binding Transcription Factor Activity, Nuclear Steroid Receptor Activity, Nuclear Receptor Activity, Zinc Ion Binding, Nuclear Receptor Coactivator Activity, Chromatin DNA Binding, Nuclear Vitamin D Receptor Binding, Nuclear Retinoic Acid Receptor Binding, Sequence-Specific DNA Binding, Metal Ion Binding, and Nuclear Thyroid Hormone Receptor Binding.

Process information includes in utero embryonic development, maternal placenta development, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, cell differentiation, regulation of myelination, response to retinoic acid, steroid hormone-mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription, positive regulation of transcription by RNA Polymerase Two, retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway, anatomical structure development, ventricular cardiac muscle cell differentiation, and cellular response to retinoic acid.
