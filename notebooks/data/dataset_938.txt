Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: river, country, discharge, runoff, area, density, nitrate, export, deposition, precipitation, binary class

This dataset focuses on river-related characteristics across different countries, examining various environmental and geographical factors. It includes information on discharge rates, runoff patterns, area coverage, population density, nitrate levels, export rates, deposition, and precipitation. The data has been binarized to create a simplified classification system based on the mean values of the target feature. This transformation allows for a more straightforward analysis of the data, dividing instances into positive and negative categories. The dataset is particularly useful for studies related to river systems, environmental science, and geographical analysis.
