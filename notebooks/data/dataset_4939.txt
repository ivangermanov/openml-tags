The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with one thousand eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point nineteen, while the average degree is approximately three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network was created using adaptive probabilistic networks with hidden variables.

The Insurance Bayesian Network features various factors related to driving history, vehicle characteristics, and socio-economic status. These factors include driving skill, age, ruggedness of the automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft devices, driving quality, risk aversion, good student discounts, other cars owned, make and model of the vehicle, accident history, socio-economic status, home base, property cost, car value, anti-lock brakes, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft rates, airbags, medical costs, senior training, and cushioning.
