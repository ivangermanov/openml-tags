QSAR-TID-101073 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101073. The dataset has seventy-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and one thousand twenty-four FCFP six features.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101073. The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The dataset is related to the Putative Uncharacterized Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase SgK110, which is a single protein target. The target is also known as SBK3, SGK110, SH3-Binding Domain Kinase Family Member Three, Sugen Kinase One Hundred Ten, and Uncharacterized Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase SBK3.

The target is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and other protein kinase group, and other protein kinase NKF1 family. It is involved in protein phosphorylation and phosphorylation.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, protein kinase, phosphorylation.
