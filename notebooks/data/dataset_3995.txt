Energy Efficiency 

Tags: Machine Learning, Meteorology 

This dataset was obtained from the UCI Repository. 

The dataset was created to perform energy analysis using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. These buildings differ with respect to their glazing area, glazing area distribution, and orientation, amongst other parameters. Various settings were simulated as functions of these characteristics to obtain seven hundred sixty-eight building shapes. The dataset consists of seven hundred sixty-eight samples and eight features, aiming to predict two real-valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

The dataset contains eight attributes or features and two responses or outcomes. The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. Specifically, the features include relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. The two responses are heating load and cooling load.

The dataset can be used to accurately estimate the energy performance of residential buildings using statistical machine learning tools. It has been used in research to estimate energy performance of residential buildings.
