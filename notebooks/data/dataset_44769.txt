OkCupid-Stem Seed One N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This dataset is a subsampling of the OkCupid-Stem dataset generated using a specific set of arguments. The resulting dataset has been uniformly sampled across classes, columns, and rows to meet certain maximum thresholds.

The dataset sampling process involves selecting a specified number of classes, ensuring that each class is represented proportionally to its frequency in the original dataset. This is achieved by calculating the value counts of each class and using them as probabilities for selection.

Once the desired number of classes is reached, the corresponding indices are used to select the relevant data points from the original dataset. The same approach is applied to sampling columns, where a specified number of column indices are randomly selected without replacement.

Finally, the dataset is further reduced by uniformly sampling a specified number of rows while maintaining the proportional representation of each class. This is done using a stratified split, which ensures that the resulting dataset retains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset.

Features of this dataset include age, body type, diet, drinking habits, drug use, education level, ethnicity, height, income, location, offspring, sexual orientation, pet ownership, religious beliefs, gender, zodiac sign, smoking habits, language proficiency, relationship status, and occupation.
