QSAR-TID-10274 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 features.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor. The Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor is a single protein, also known as Gnrhr, GnRH-R, and GnRH receptor, and it is a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. It is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, circadian rhythm, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, cellular response to hormone stimulus, and cellular response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
