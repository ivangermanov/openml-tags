The Allstate Claims Severity dataset is part of the regression on categorical and numerical features benchmark. It belongs to a larger collection of datasets designed to test machine learning models.

When you have been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter most - family, friends, and other loved ones. The last thing you want to spend your time or mental energy on is pushing paper with your insurance agent. This is why Allstate, a personal insurer in the United States, is continually seeking fresh ideas to improve their claims service for their customers.

Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this challenge, participants are invited to create an algorithm that accurately predicts claims severity. By demonstrating insight into better ways to predict claims severity, aspiring competitors have the chance to be part of Allstate's efforts to ensure a worry-free customer experience.

Each row in this dataset represents an insurance claim. The goal is to predict the value for the loss column. The dataset includes a range of features, including categorical variables such as category one, category two, and so on, as well as continuous variables.
