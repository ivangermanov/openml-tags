The Annealing dataset from UCI is an original dataset. The exact meaning of the features and classes is largely unknown.

Annealing, in metallurgy and materials science, is a heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it more workable. It involves heating a material to above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature, and then cooling.

Attribute Information:

Family refers to the type of steel alloy used, including GB, GK, GS, TN, ZA, ZF, ZH, ZM, and ZS.

Product Type describes the category of the steel product, which can be either C, H, or G.

Steel Type specifies the type of steel, which includes R, A, U, K, M, S, W, V, or not applicable.

Carbon Content is a continuous feature representing the percentage of carbon in the steel alloy.

Hardness is a continuous feature measuring the steel's resistance to scratching or abrasion.

Temper Rolling indicates whether the steel has undergone temper rolling, which can either be true or false.

Condition specifies the condition of the steel, which can be either S, A, X, or not applicable.

Formability measures the ease with which the steel can be shaped or formed, ranging from one to five.

Strength is a continuous feature representing the steel's ability to withstand stress or pressure.

Non-Ageing indicates whether the steel is resistant to ageing, which can either be true or false.

Surface Finish describes the texture or appearance of the steel's surface, which can be either P, M, or not applicable.

Surface Quality evaluates the overall quality of the steel's surface, ranging from D to G.

Enamelability measures the steel's ability to be coated with enamel, ranging from one to five.

BC, BF, BT, BW/ME, BL, M, Chrom, Phos, CBond, Marvi, Exptl, Ferro, Corr, Blue/Bright/Varn/Clean, Lustre, Jurofm, S, and P are all binary features indicating the presence or absence of certain characteristics or properties.

Shape describes the physical shape of the steel product, which can either be Coil or Sheet.

Thickness, Width, and Length are continuous features measuring the dimensions of the steel product.

Oil specifies whether the steel product is coated with oil, which can either be yes, no, or not applicable.

Bore refers to the diameter of the steel product's hole or opening, measured in increments of 500.

Packing indicates how the steel products are packaged, ranging from one to three.

Classes categorize the steel products into one of five categories or Unknown.
