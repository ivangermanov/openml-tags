**Labor Negotiations**

This dataset pertains to the final settlements in labor negotiations in the Canadian industry, specifically focusing on the business and personal services sector.

**Source Information**

**Dataset Description**

The dataset comprises all collective agreements reached in the business and personal services sector for locals with at least five hundred members, including teachers, nurses, university staff, police, and others, in Canada during 1987 and the first quarter of 1988.

**Past Usage**

This dataset has been utilized for testing concept learning software, particularly an experimental method to learn two-tiered concept descriptions.
