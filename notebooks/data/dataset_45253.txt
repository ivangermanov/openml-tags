**Pigs Bayesian Network. Sample One.**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. It is a discrete and very large network, consisting of four hundred forty-one nodes and five hundred ninety-two arcs. The network has a total of five thousand six hundred eighteen parameters, with an average Markov blanket size of three point six six and an average degree of two point six eight. The maximum in-degree of the network is two.

The network features a range of variables, including those related to pig health and behavior. Unfortunately, the exact nature of these variables is unclear due to their cryptic naming conventions.

The Pigs Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with Bayesian networks, particularly those focused on large and complex systems.
