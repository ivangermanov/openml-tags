This dataset, named CNN Stock Pred NYSE, is categorized under Images and Life Science. It comprises various features from distinct categories, including technical indicators, futures contracts, commodity prices, global market indices, major US company prices, and treasury bill rates. 

The features encompass date, close, volume, momentum indicators, rate of change, exponential moving averages, treasury bill rates, oil prices, gold prices, currency exchange rates, and stock prices of prominent companies such as Apple, Amazon, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Exxon Mobil, and others. 

Additionally, the dataset includes indices from various stock exchanges worldwide, including the French CAC, German DAX, Hong Kong Hang Seng Index, Japanese Nikkei, South Korean KOSPI, Nasdaq, Russell Index, and S&P Index.

This dataset exclusively contains information from the New York Stock Exchange.

In another dataset, HTRU2, pulsar candidates are described through eight continuous variables and one class variable. Pulsars are rare types of neutron stars that emit radio signals detectable on Earth, making them scientifically significant for studying space-time, interstellar mediums, and states of matter.

Pulsar searches involve identifying periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes. Each pulsar produces a unique emission pattern that varies slightly with every rotation. A potential signal detection, known as a candidate, is averaged over numerous rotations. Without additional information, every candidate could be a real pulsar. However, most detections are caused by radio frequency interference and noise, making genuine signals difficult to identify.

Machine learning tools are employed to automatically classify pulsar candidates, treating the data as a binary classification problem where legitimate pulsars are the minority positive class and spurious examples are the majority negative class.

The dataset consists of numerous spurious examples caused by radio frequency interference and noise, along with real pulsar examples, all of which have been validated by human annotators. The data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF.

Each candidate is characterized by eight continuous variables extracted from the integrated pulse profile and the DM-SNR curve. These variables include mean, standard deviation, excess kurtosis, and skewness of the integrated profile and DM-SNR curve, respectively.
