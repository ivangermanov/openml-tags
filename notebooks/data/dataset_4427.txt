Road Safety Seed Two Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Road Safety dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the resulting dataset has a maximum of ten classes. 

The original dataset had more than four hundred forty-one thousand rows, but this subsampled version has a maximum of two thousand rows. Similarly, the number of columns has been reduced from the original to a maximum of one hundred columns. 

The subsampling process also involved selecting a specified number of columns uniformly at random, and then selecting the corresponding rows based on the sampled classes. This ensured that the resulting dataset has a balanced representation of all the sampled classes.

The dataset includes various features related to road safety, including vehicle reference, vehicle type, vehicle maneuver, location, and other relevant details. It also includes information about casualties, such as age, sex, and pedestrian movement.
