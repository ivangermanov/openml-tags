The QSAR-TID-100861 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100861. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015. It is tagged as Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Statistics, and study_3.

The preferred name for this target is C-X-C chemokine receptor type three, also known as CD one eighty-three, Cmkar three, C-X-C chemokine receptor type three, Cxcr three, and CXC-R three. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus.

This protein target classification falls under one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, chemokine receptor, and CXC chemokine receptor. Its description highlights its relationship with accession number O eight eight four one zero.

In terms of component, it is associated with the plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, cell surface, and membrane. For function, it involves G protein-coupled receptor activity, chemokine receptor activity, C-C chemokine receptor activity, C-X-C chemokine receptor activity, chemokine binding, C-C chemokine binding, C-X-C chemokine binding, and signaling receptor activity.

It plays a role in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, negative regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, regulation of leukocyte migration, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, T cell chemotaxis, negative regulation of angiogenesis, calcium-mediated signaling, regulation of cell adhesion, positive regulation of angiogenesis, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, positive regulation of chemotaxis, and positive regulation of release of sequestered calcium ion into cytosol.
