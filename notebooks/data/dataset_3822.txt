California Housing Prices 

Tags: Demographics, Sociology 

Context 
This dataset was used in the second chapter of a recent book on hands-on machine learning, serving as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms due to its requirement of rudimentary data cleaning, having an easily understandable list of variables, and sitting at an optimal size between being too toyish and too cumbersome.

Content 
The data contains information from the California census, providing an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning. Although it may not be helpful in predicting current housing prices, it provides a comprehensive overview of the houses found in a given California district along with some summary statistics about them based on the census data.

Be warned that the data is not cleaned, requiring some preprocessing steps before use. The columns are straightforward, with descriptive names that are easy to understand. They include geographical coordinates, demographic information, and economic indicators.

Acknowledgments 
This data was initially featured in a research paper on sparse spatial autoregressions and later reused in a popular machine learning book.

Inspiration 
For those interested in exploring this dataset further, there is a kernel on machine learning basics using this dataset in R, as well as a Python-based introductory tutorial available online.

Features 
The dataset includes geographical coordinates, demographic information, and economic indicators, providing a comprehensive overview of the houses found in a given California district.
