QSAR-TID-100861 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100861. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100861. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the C-X-C chemokine receptor type three, which is a single protein target.

The C-X-C chemokine receptor type three is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor family. It is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, inflammatory response, immune response, and cell signaling.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the C-X-C chemokine receptor type three. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization.
