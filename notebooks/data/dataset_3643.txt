The Dril Tweets dataset is a collection of tweets related to computer systems and machine learning. The dataset was scraped from Twitter in January and contains various statistics about each tweet, including the date posted, the text of the tweet itself, and engagement metrics such as likes and retweets.

A humorous observation can be made about the different priorities of people at various stages of life. For instance, as an infant, one might cry out for their father figure, whereas as a young adult, one might prioritize access to information and exclaim, "I want my data!" This contrast highlights the vastly different concerns that individuals have at different points in their lives.

Many thanks are due to the developers of Get Old Tweets, whose scraping tool made this dataset possible. The inspiration behind this project lies in the amusing comparison between the priorities of youth and adulthood.

Features of the dataset include the unique identifier for each tweet, a link to the tweet on Twitter, the text of the tweet, the date it was posted, the number of times it was retweeted, the number of users who marked it as a favorite, any usernames mentioned in the tweet, any relevant hashtags, and geographic information associated with the tweet.
