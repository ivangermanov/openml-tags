QSAR-TID-102578 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102578. The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Muscarinic Receptor Four. The Muscarinic Receptor Four is a single protein, also known as GPM Four Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor, and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor. It is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of locomotion.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in Muscarinic Receptor Four as a potential drug target.
