Subsampling of the dataset DNA with seed equals three arguments N Rows equals two thousand arguments N Columns equals one hundred arguments N Classes equals ten arguments No Stratify equals False.

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a given dataset. It takes several parameters including a seed for reproducibility, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to stratify or not.

The function first gets the unique classes in the dataset and selects a specified number of them randomly. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples the columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum, it chooses a certain number of column indices randomly and filters the data again.

Finally, it checks if the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum. If so, it uses stratified sampling to select a certain number of rows while maintaining the class balance.
