This pharmacogenomic study investigates the patterns of drug activity in cancer cell lines. These cell lines come from the NCI Sixty Human Tumor Cell Lines established by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute to screen for the toxicity of chemical compound repositories in diverse cancer cell lines. The NCI Sixty includes cell lines derived from cancers of colorectal, renal, ovarian, breast, prostate, lung, and central nervous system origin, as well as leukemia and melanoma.

The study examines the effects of Thioguanine on these cell lines, exploring how the drug interacts with various biological pathways. The cell lines are an essential tool for understanding the mechanisms of cancer and developing effective treatments.

The study's findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of cancer cells and the efficacy of Thioguanine as a treatment option. By analyzing the patterns of drug activity, researchers can identify potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
