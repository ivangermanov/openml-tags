QSAR-TID-12659 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12659. It has five hundred seventy-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Dataset Description:

This dataset provides information about the Prostanoid DP receptor, also known as PGD two receptor or PGD receptor. The Prostanoid DP receptor is a single protein, specifically a membrane receptor, belonging to Family A G protein-coupled receptor and classified under Small molecule receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, male sex determination, sleep, mast cell degranulation, adenosine metabolic process, and cellular response to prostaglandin D stimulus.

Some of the molecules associated with this receptor include ASAPIPRANT, VIDUPIPRANT, and LAROPIPRANT, which act as Prostanoid DP receptor antagonists.

Keywords: QSAR, Prostanoid DP receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, membrane receptor, inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
