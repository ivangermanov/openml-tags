QSAR-TID-12659 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12659. The dataset has 577 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The Prostanoid DP receptor, also known as the PGD2 receptor, is a single protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The receptor is a membrane receptor that binds to prostaglandin D2, a lipid-like ligand. It is expressed in Homo sapiens and has been implicated in various diseases, including asthma and allergic rhinitis.

The dataset contains information on several compounds that act as antagonists of the Prostanoid DP receptor, including ASAPIPRANT, VIDUPIPRANT, and LAROPIPRANT. These compounds have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and may be useful in the treatment of diseases related to the Prostanoid DP receptor.
