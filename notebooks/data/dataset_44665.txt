Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is defined to take in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of classes from the unique classes in the dataset, ensuring that the number of selected classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. The indices where one of these classes is present are selected, and the corresponding data and target values are subsetted.

If the number of columns in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of columns, the function uniformly samples columns to reduce the dimensionality. The selected columns are then subsetted from the original data.

If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data accordingly and splits it into a subset of the desired size. The target values are then separated from the data.

Finally, the function returns a dataset with the subsetted data, target values, categorical mask, and column names.
