This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EUR/SGD pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a single candlestick for one day, excluding weekends since Forex markets are closed during those days.

The data spans from January first to December thirteenth and uses the Europe/Amsterdam timezone for the timestamp feature.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high bid and ask prices of the following day compared to the mean high bid and ask prices of the current minute. In other words, if the mean high price increases the following day, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only, and realistic trade strategies should only be applied to predictions based on close attributes.
