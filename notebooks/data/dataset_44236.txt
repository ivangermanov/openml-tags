Tags: Customer Churn

Churn occurs when customers are leaving their current service provider and moving to another one. This is a significant business problem because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one from leaving. Customer retention is crucial for businesses to maintain their customer base and avoid the high costs associated with acquiring new customers.
