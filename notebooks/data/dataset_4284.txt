**Meta Album Subcellular Human Protein Dataset (Mini)**

This dataset is a subset of the Subcellular dataset in the Protein Atlas project. The original dataset stems from the Human Protein Atlas Image Classification Kaggle competition, comprising thirty-one thousand seventy-two RGBY images, each of which belongs to one or more out of twenty-eight classes. The labels correspond to protein organelle localizations.

For Meta Album, we performed two modifications: Firstly, to turn the dataset into a multi-class dataset, we dropped all images belonging to more than a single class and also those images that belong to classes with less than forty members. Secondly, we converted the remaining images into RGB simply by dropping the yellow channel; this was also a common practice in the competition. Finally, and as for all datasets in Meta Album, the images from the original dataset were resized to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight image size.
