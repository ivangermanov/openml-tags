This data file contains details of various nations and their flags. It was collected primarily from the "Collins Gem Guide to Flags" published by Collins Publishers in 1986. The dataset was donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository on May 15, 1990.

With this data, researchers can attempt tasks such as predicting a country's religion based on its size and the colors present in its flag. The dataset comprises 194 instances and 30 attributes in total. Ten of these attributes are numeric, while the rest are either Boolean or nominal in nature. Importantly, there are no missing values in this dataset.

The attributes cover a wide range of information about each country and its flag. These include:

- Name of the country
- Geographical location (landmass and zone)
- Area in thousands of square kilometers
- Population in millions
- Predominant language and religion
- Flag characteristics such as:
  - Number of vertical bars and horizontal stripes
  - Number of different colors
  - Presence of specific colors (red, green, blue, gold, white, black, orange)
  - Predominant color
  - Number of circles, crosses (upright and diagonal), quartered sections
  - Presence of sun or star symbols, crescent moon, triangles
  - Presence of inanimate or animate images
  - Presence of text or writing
  - Colors in the top-left and bottom-right corners

The dataset provides a rich source of information for various analytical purposes, allowing researchers to explore relationships between a country's geographical, demographic, and cultural attributes and the design elements of its national flag.
