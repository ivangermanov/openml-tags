Internet Advertisements Seed Three Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Internet Advertisements dataset, with a seed of three. It was generated using the following source code:

The subsample function takes in several parameters, including the seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sample. The function first uniformly samples the classes, then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. It then uniformly samples the columns, if required. If the resulting dataset is still too large, it stratifies the sample accordingly.

The dataset features include the aspect ratio, URL features such as the presence of certain words or phrases, original URL features, anchor URL features, and alternative features. These features are used to classify internet advertisements.
