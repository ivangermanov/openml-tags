Name: Steel Plates Fault Dataset with Subsampling

Tags: Subsampling of the Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The subsampling process started by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded a certain maximum, a random sample of classes was selected, with the probability of each class being selected proportional to its frequency in the original dataset. The indices of the samples belonging to the selected classes were then used to subset the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If the number of columns exceeded a certain maximum, a random sample of columns was selected. The selected columns were then used to subset the dataset.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If the number of rows exceeded a certain maximum, a random sample of rows was selected, stratified by the target variable to maintain the original class distribution.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, with the categorical columns converted to string format for compatibility with OpenML.
