The Multiple Features Dataset: Karhunen is one of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 

This dataset consists of two thousand instances, with two hundred instances per class, digitized in binary images. 

The attribute information represents sixty-four descriptors from the Karhunen-Loève Transform, a linear transformation corresponding to the projection of the images on the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix.

A relevant paper uses a slightly different version of the database, discussing handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers. Another paper uses the database as is, reviewing statistical pattern recognition.

The dataset has six files, each containing two thousand patterns stored in ASCII on two thousand lines. The first two hundred patterns are of class zero, followed by sets of two hundred patterns for each of the classes one through nine. Corresponding patterns in different feature sets correspond to the same original character. 

The source image dataset is lost. However, using the pixel dataset, sampled versions of the original images may be obtained. 

Has Missing Values? No.

Additional Variable Information: Six files contain different feature sets, including Fourier coefficients of the character shapes, profile correlations, Karhunen-Loève coefficients, pixel averages in two-by-three windows, Zernike moments, and morphological features.
