Multiple Features Dataset: Fourier
Tags: OpenML-CC, OpenML, study, uci

This dataset is part of a collection describing features of handwritten numerals (zero to nine) extracted from Dutch utility maps. It is one of six datasets, with each corresponding to the same original characters. The dataset contains digitized binary images of handwritten numerals, with instances per class, totaling instances.

The attributes represent Fourier coefficients of the character shapes. This dataset is part of the Multiple Features Dataset, which includes various feature sets such as profile correlations, Karhunen-Love coefficients, pixel averages, Zernike moments, and morphological features.

The patterns are stored in ASCII format, with each line representing a single pattern. The patterns are grouped by class, starting with the digit zero and progressing through nine. Corresponding patterns across different feature sets relate to the same original character.

While the source image dataset is no longer available, sampled versions of the original images can be reconstructed using the pixel dataset at a resolution of fifteen by sixteen pixels.

This dataset has been used in research on handwritten digit recognition and combined classifiers. It has also been referenced in studies on statistical pattern recognition.

The Multiple Features Dataset provides a comprehensive set of features for analyzing handwritten numerals, making it valuable for research in pattern recognition, machine learning, and image processing.
