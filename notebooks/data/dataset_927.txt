Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: subject, question one through question fourteen, comparison, binary class

This dataset focuses on child witness testimony and has been binarized for analysis purposes. The original numeric data has been transformed into a two-class system, allowing for easier classification and comparison. The features include various questions posed to child witnesses, as well as a comparison metric and the resulting binary classification. This binarized version enables researchers to conduct mythbusting studies and examine the reliability of child witness testimony in a more straightforward manner.
