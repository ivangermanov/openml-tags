Swiss Banknote Counterfeit Detection

Tags: Context

Will you be able to identify genuine and counterfeit banknotes, even if half of the data is counterfeit? Perfect for testing different outlier detection algorithms.

The dataset includes information about the shape of the bill, as well as the label. It is comprised of banknotes in total, with an equal number of genuine and counterfeit notes. The attributes include whether a banknote is counterfeit or genuine, as well as various physical characteristics of the bill.

The physical characteristics of the bill include its length, the width of the left and right edges, the bottom margin width, the top margin width, and the length of the diagonal.

The original data source is a well-known multivariate statistics textbook.

Applications

While it might be relatively easy for a classifier to decide whether the banknotes are counterfeit or not, what about methods using outlier detection? Classical methods of outlier detection won't work, since half of the data consist of outliers, namely counterfeit bills, so more robust methods will be needed.
