QSAR-TID-10626 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10626. The dataset has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10626. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Serotonin five a receptor, which is a protein target classified as a membrane receptor and a family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The Serotonin five a receptor is a single protein target that is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission. It is also involved in the response to estradiol and hippocampus development.

The dataset is scraped from ChEMBL, which provides a comprehensive collection of bioactive molecules and their targets. The dataset includes information on the protein target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification.
