Demographics, MTL QSAR, Study Three

The QSAR-TID-10626 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10626. This dataset has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains data scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, and Reactome.

Scraped data includes information about the serotonin five-a receptor, also known as the five hydroxytryptamine receptor five-A, which belongs to the family-A G protein-coupled receptor group. It is primarily found in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and response to estradiol.
