QSAR-TID-101273 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101273. The data was obtained from ChEMBL version seventeen and consists of seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four, and many others.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, which aimed to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project involved the collection and integration of large amounts of data from various sources, including ChEMBL.

The dataset is related to Myosin-IIIB, also known as MYO three B, which is a single protein enzyme belonging to the STE protein kinase group, specifically the STE protein kinase NinaC subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including microfilament motor activity, nucleotide binding, cytoskeletal motor activity, and others.

Myosin-IIIB is expressed in various organisms, including Homo sapiens, and is classified under the species group. It has been associated with several diseases and disorders, including visual perception and sensory perception of sound.
