Tallo Tags: Tallo - a global tree allometry and crown architecture database.

This dataset is a recreation of the original Tallo dataset using Python scripts. It is a comprehensive collection of georeferenced and taxonomically standardized records of individual trees, comprising measurements of stem diameter, height, and/or crown radius. The data was compiled from numerous globally distributed sites, encompassing a vast range of tree species.

The dataset includes a wide array of features, including unique tree identifiers, phylogenetic divisions, family and genus names, species binomials, geographic coordinates, and various tree characteristics such as stem diameter, height, and crown radius. Additionally, the dataset incorporates information on biogeographic realms, biome types, and climatic conditions, including mean annual rainfall, rainfall seasonality, aridity indices, mean annual temperatures, and maximum temperatures.

Each record also includes an identifier for trees with height or crown radius values flagged as outliers, as well as a reference code corresponding to the data source from which the record was obtained.

The constructed dataset and associated metadata are intended for use in predicting tree height based on climate data and stem diameter. As a result, a significant portion of the data is ignored by default, with certain attributes designated as ignored.

It is essential to note that samples were taken from diverse sources across multiple decades, and multiple samples may have been taken from distinct trees in the same approximate geographical location. However, these relationships between samples are disregarded when generating tasks on OpenML.
