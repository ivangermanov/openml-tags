Tallo is a global tree allometry and crown architecture database. This dataset is a collection of georeferenced and taxonomically standardized records of individual trees for which stem diameter, height, and/or crown radius have been measured. The data was compiled from globally distributed sites and includes measurements for tree species. The dataset is for use case three in the referenced paper, predicting tree height based on climate data and stem diameter.

The dataset contains a large portion of data that is ignored by default, set as attributes to be ignored. Samples are taken from different sources spanning decades, and multiple samples may be taken from distinct trees in the same approximate geographical location. These relationships between samples are ignored when generating tasks.

The dataset features include:

* Tree ID: a unique tree identifier code
* Division: the major phylogenetic division, either Angiosperm or Gymnosperm
* Family: the family name
* Genus: the genus name
* Species: the species binomial name
* Latitude: the latitude in decimal degrees
* Longitude: the longitude in decimal degrees
* Stem Diameter: the stem diameter in centimeters, log-scaled
* Height: the tree height in meters, log-scaled
* Crown Radius: the crown radius in meters
* Height Outlier: an identifier for trees with height values flagged as outliers
* Crown Radius Outlier: an identifier for trees with crown radius values flagged as outliers
* Reference ID: the reference code corresponding to the data source from which a record was obtained
* Realm: the biogeographic realm, following the classification of Olson et al.
* Biome: the biome type, following the classification of Olson et al.
* Mean Annual Rainfall: the mean annual rainfall in millimeters per year, obtained from the WorldClim2 database
* Rainfall Seasonality: the rainfall seasonality, obtained from the WorldClim2 database
* Aridity Index: the aridity index, calculated as mean annual precipitation over potential evapotranspiration, log-scaled
* Mean Annual Temperature: the mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius, obtained from the WorldClim2 database
* Maximum Temperature: the maximum temperature of the warmest month in degrees Celsius, obtained from the WorldClim2 database
* AT AI: the ratio of mean annual temperature over log-scaled aridity index
