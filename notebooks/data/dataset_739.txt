Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Body weight, Brain weight, Maximum life span, Gestation time, Predation index, Sleep exposure index, Danger index, Binary class

This dataset focuses on sleep patterns and related physiological factors across various species. It has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified classification problem. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target variable and categorizing instances below this threshold as positive, while those above are labeled negative. This transformation allows for binary classification tasks and potentially simplifies analysis.

The dataset includes several features that may influence or correlate with sleep patterns. These encompass physical characteristics such as body and brain weight, as well as life history traits like maximum lifespan and gestation period. Additionally, environmental factors are considered through indices measuring predation risk, sleep exposure, and overall danger levels. The binary class serves as the target variable for classification tasks.

This sleep-related dataset could be valuable for researchers studying comparative physiology, evolutionary biology, or developing predictive models for sleep patterns across species. Its binarized nature makes it particularly suitable for introductory machine learning exercises or as a simplified version of more complex sleep-related datasets.
