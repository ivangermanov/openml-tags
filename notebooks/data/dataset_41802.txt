This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex aud/cad from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute.

The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price of the following minute relative to the mean high price of the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases in the subsequent minute, and false when it decreases or remains unchanged.
