The dataset named "AP Endometrium Prostate" is a collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be used to estimate various quality metrics such as accuracy, precision, and area under the ROC curve for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms. The repository was created in response to the growing need in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized set of microarray classification problems that could be used by different researchers. 

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the expO (Expression Project For Oncology) repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The expO project aims to obtain tissue samples under standardized conditions and conduct gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The data is updated with clinical outcomes and shared in the public domain without intellectual property restrictions. 

The decision to use data from the expO repository was based on factors such as the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, and the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies. The availability of a large number of samples for different tumor types also influenced this decision.

Researchers are encouraged to acknowledge the use of the GEMLeR datasets in their publications to help others access the same datasets and replicate experiments. Proper citation guidelines are provided for referencing the repository and the original data source.
