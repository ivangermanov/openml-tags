SurvBoard-TCGA-BLCA-complete 
Tags: Multi-omics Bladder Cancer Dataset containing complete modality samples from the TCGA project.

Features: Patient ID, Overall Survival, Overall Survival Days, Clinical Age at Initial Pathologic Diagnosis, Clinical Gender, Clinical Race, Clinical AJCC Pathologic Tumor Stage, Clinical Clinical Stage, Clinical Histological Type, Gene Expression, and many more.

The dataset includes a wide range of clinical features, such as patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and survival outcomes. Additionally, it contains a vast amount of gene expression data, which can be used to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for bladder cancer.

The gene expression features are comprehensive, covering a broad spectrum of genes involved in various biological processes. This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder cancer and to develop new strategies for diagnosis and treatment.
