The Short Track Speed Skating database provides an extensive collection of data covering international short track games over the past five years, specifically focusing on men's five hundred meter events. This comprehensive dataset includes detailed lap data, comprising individual times and rankings for each game, spanning from the 2012/2013 season to the present.

The dataset encompasses various international competitions, including the World Cup, World Championship, European Championship, and Olympic Games. The original data was sourced from the International Skating Union's official website and has undergone rigorous cleaning procedures.

This dataset presents numerous opportunities for exploration and analysis, sparking intriguing questions such as: What happens when multiple athletes from the same team participate in a game â€“ do they experience improved performances? How do athletes' performances evolve throughout a season and across multiple seasons? Do certain athletes exhibit distinctive patterns regarding time allocation and overtaking opportunities?

Additionally, the dataset invites investigation into the impact of rule changes, such as the introduction of 'no toe starts' in July 2015, on athlete performance. Another area of exploration is the potential existence of a home advantage in short track speed skating, similar to what is observed in other sports.

Features of this dataset include:

Season, Series, City, Country, Year, Month, Day, Distance, Round, Group, Number of Skaters, Athlete's Name, Nationality, Rank in Group, Starting Position, Time, Qualification
