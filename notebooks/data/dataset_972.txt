Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: site, days after flowering, fruit, weight, store weight, penetration, solids, brix, ground spot color, glucose, fructose, sucrose, total, glucose plus fructose, starch, sweetness, flavor, dry or moist, fiber, heat input at emergence, heat input at flowering, binary class

This dataset focuses on stored squash and includes various measurements related to fruit characteristics, sugar content, and growing conditions. The original multi-class target feature has been simplified into a binary classification problem. The data can be used for studying factors affecting squash quality and storage. Researchers interested in agricultural science, food storage, and plant biology may find this dataset valuable for analysis and modeling purposes.
