The QSAR-TID-101225 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101225. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The drug target is Myosin IIIA, also known as MYO three A or Myosin-three-a. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, or protein kinase, specifically belonging to the STE protein kinase group and STE twenty family, and further classified into the STE protein kinase NinaC subfamily.

Myosin IIIA is found in Homo sapiens and is involved in various biological processes, including visual perception, sensory perception of sound, protein phosphorylation, and regulation of actin filament length. It is also associated with diseases such as deafness, autosomal recessive thirty.
