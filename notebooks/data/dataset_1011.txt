Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher. 

This dataset contains information about Escherichia coli bacteria, commonly known as E. coli. It has been modified from its original multi-class format to a binary classification problem, simplifying the target variable into two categories. This transformation allows for more straightforward analysis and modeling approaches. The dataset includes various features that describe characteristics of E. coli bacteria, which can be used to predict their classification.

The dataset is intended for use in mythbusting and various studies related to microbiology and bioinformatics. It provides valuable information for researchers and data scientists interested in bacterial classification and analysis. The binarization of the target variable makes this dataset particularly useful for binary classification tasks and machine learning experiments.
