Name: Fabert Seed One Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Fabert with seed one, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including the seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, as well as a flag for stratified sampling.

The function first selects a subset of classes to maintain, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the corresponding data points and columns, and finally reduces the number of rows to the maximum allowed while maintaining the class distribution.

The resulting dataset is a subsampled version of the original Fabert dataset, with one hundred columns and two thousand rows, stratified across ten classes.

Features: (omitted due to unreadability)

Keywords: dataset subsampling, stratified sampling, class distribution, data reduction.
