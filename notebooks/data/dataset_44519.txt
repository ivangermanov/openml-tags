Fabert Seed One Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Using Stratification

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Fabert dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The class sampling process involved selecting ten unique classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes were present in the sampled dataset. This was done to maintain a balanced representation of classes in the subsampled dataset.

The column sampling process involved selecting one hundred columns from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected columns were representative of the overall dataset. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential characteristics.

The row sampling process involved selecting two thousand rows from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected rows were representative of the overall dataset. This was done using stratification, which involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets based on the class distribution.

The resulting dataset consists of two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns. The dataset has been transformed to ensure that categorical columns are represented as strings, making it suitable for use in machine learning algorithms.
