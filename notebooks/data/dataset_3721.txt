QSAR-TID-11061 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Motilin Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Motilin Receptor. The Motilin Receptor is a single protein and its preferred name is Motilin Receptor. It has synonyms such as GPR thirty-eight, G-protein coupled receptor thirty-eight, MLNR, and Motilin Receptor.

The dataset has multiple features including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX fifty. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Motilin Receptor is a membrane receptor and it belongs to Family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is a peptide receptor and it is involved in signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and it was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
