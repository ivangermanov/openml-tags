The dataset provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market in Lisbon, offering a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of rentals in the city.

A unique identifier, known as the Room ID, is assigned to each Airbnb listing, which can be accessed through its corresponding URL on the Airbnb website. Similarly, every host is identified by a distinct Host ID, which leads to their personal webpage on the platform.

The type of accommodation offered by each listing falls under one of three categories: Entire Home or Apartment, Private Room, or Shared Room. Furthermore, the dataset includes information about the Borough and Neighborhood where each listing is located, providing a more detailed understanding of the geographic distribution of rentals across the city.

The number of reviews received by each listing serves as an indicator of its popularity, with Airbnb stating that approximately seventy percent of visits result in a review. Additionally, the Overall Satisfaction rating, based on the average rating given by reviewers, provides insight into the quality of service offered by each host.

Other essential details about each listing include the maximum number of guests it can accommodate, the number of bedrooms available, and the daily price quoted in US dollars. The Minimum Stay requirement, set by the host, is also included in the dataset. 

The geographic coordinates, namely Latitude and Longitude, provide the exact location of each listing on the map. Lastly, the Last Modified field indicates the date and time when the data was extracted from the Airbnb website.
