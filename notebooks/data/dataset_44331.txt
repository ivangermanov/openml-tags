The Meta-Album Dogs Dataset Extended 

The researchers from Stanford University created the original Dogs dataset, which contains more than twenty thousand images belonging to one hundred twenty breeds of dogs worldwide. The images and annotations came from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. The number of images per class and the resolution is not balanced. Each class can have a varying number of images with a resolution ranging from one hundred x one hundred five to two thousand four hundred forty-eight x three thousand two hundred sixty-four pixels. This dataset has a little inter-class variation and a large intra-class variation due to color, pose, and occlusion. Most of the images in this dataset are taken in man-made environments leading to a significant background variation.

The preprocessed version of this dataset is prepared from the original dataset by cropping the images from either side to make squared images. In case an image has a resolution lower than one hundred twenty-eight pixels, the squared images are done by either duplicating the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right most three columns based on the orientation of the original image. These square images are then resized into one hundred twenty-eight x one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
