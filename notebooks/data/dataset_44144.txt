House Sales

This dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same way. Specifically, it falls under the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

The original House Sales dataset contains information about house sale prices for King County, including Seattle. The data spans a period of one year, from May two thousand fourteen to May two thousand fifteen. There are nineteen house features, plus the price and identification columns, with a total of twenty-one thousand one hundred thirteen observations.

One of the key aspects of this dataset is that the date has been converted into year, month, and day numeric values. This makes it an ideal dataset for evaluating simple regression models.

Some of the notable features include the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage of living areas, lot size, grade level, square footage of areas above and below ground, year built, year renovated, latitude and longitude coordinates, and average square footage of living areas and lots within a fifteen-house radius.
