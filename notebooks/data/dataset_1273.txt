The QSAR-TID-101557 dataset is a collection of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data related to the biological target TID: 101557. This dataset consists of seven hundred thirty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 101557. The activity values are measured in units of pseudo-pCI50.

The biological target associated with this dataset is a single protein, specifically the serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk2, also known as serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase two. This enzyme is classified as an AGC protein kinase belonging to the AGC protein kinase Sgk family.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk2 is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of cell growth, protein phosphorylation, response to oxidative stress, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, positive regulation of transporter activity, intracellular signal transduction, and regulation of cell population proliferation.
