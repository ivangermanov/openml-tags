**Link Bayesian Network**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. It is a discrete-verylarge network with a large number of nodes and arcs.

The network has a total of seven hundred twenty-four nodes and one thousand one hundred twenty-five arcs. The number of parameters in the network is fourteen thousand two hundred eleven. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point eight, and the average degree is three point one one. The maximum in-degree of the network is three.

This network is a sample from a larger dataset and is used for linkage analysis in large pedigrees with many loops.

Features of this network include various node and arc properties, such as node degrees and Markov blanket sizes.
