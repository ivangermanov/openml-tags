This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete very large dataset.

The Link Bayesian Network has a total of nodes, with a significant number of arcs. The number of parameters is substantial, indicating a complex network structure. The average Markov blanket size is moderate, while the average degree is relatively low.

This network exhibits a maximum in-degree, which suggests that some nodes have a significant influence on others.

**Features:** 

This network includes various features such as Node Fourteen Alpha Male, Node Twenty Four Delta Female, Node Sixty Alpha Female, and many more.
