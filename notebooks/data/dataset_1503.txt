Spoken Arabic Digit Dataset

Tags: Spoken Arabic, Digit Recognition, Time Series, Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients

This dataset contains time series of mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) corresponding to spoken Arabic digits. It includes data from native Arabic speakers, equally divided between males and females. The data was collected by the Laboratory of Automatic and Signals at the University of Badji-Mokhtar Annaba in Algeria.

The dataset comprises time series of Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) taken from Arabic native speakers between the ages of eighteen and forty to represent ten spoken Arabic digits. Each speaker repeated each digit ten times, resulting in a comprehensive collection of spoken digit samples.

The data is presented in a format where each line represents thirteen MFCCs coefficients in ascending order, separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients were computed under specific conditions, including a sampling rate of hertz, bit depth, and the application of a Hamming window. A filter pre-emphasized was also applied to the data.

This dataset is particularly valuable for research in Arabic speech recognition and has been used in studies focusing on improved tree models for Arabic speech recognition and tree distribution classifiers for automatic spoken Arabic digit recognition.

The features of the dataset include various coefficients labeled as V followed by numbers, representing the different MFCCs. The final feature is the class, which likely corresponds to the spoken digit.

This resource is significant for researchers and practitioners working in the fields of speech recognition, particularly those focusing on Arabic language processing and digit recognition systems. It provides a robust foundation for developing and testing algorithms in these areas.
