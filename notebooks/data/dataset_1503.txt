The QSAR-TID-101299 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101299. This dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features represent fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it should be cited when used.

The target of this dataset is Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Eight, also known as c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase One, Jnk One, Mapk Eight, Map Kinase Eight. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group/cmGC protein kinase family/cmGC protein kinase JNK subfamily.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including ossification, neuron migration, positive regulation of neuroblast proliferation, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, response to oxidative stress, JNK cascade, JUN phosphorylation, response to UV, response to mechanical stimulus, regulation of gene expression, positive regulation of gene expression, positive regulation of cardiac muscle cell apoptotic process, and many others.

It is located in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, cytosol, axon, vesicle, dendrite cytoplasm, neuron projection, perikaryon, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, synapse, basal dendrite, Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse.

This protein has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, JUN kinase activity, MAP kinase activity, protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, enzyme activator activity, kinase activity, transferase activity, kinesin binding, enzyme binding, protein phosphatase binding, histone deacetylase regulator activity, histone deacetylase binding, protein serine kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase binding.

Keywords: QSAR, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Eight, JNK cascade, protein phosphorylation, response to oxidative stress, regulation of gene expression.
