Movinga Best Cities for Families 2019 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset was scraped from Movinga, the global moving company, and determines the top cities around the world that offer the best conditions to raise a family. The dataset was extended to add geographical location in terms of the latitude and longitude of the city. 

The original study began by selecting one hundred fifty international cities that have a reputation as attractive locations for raising a family. Then, the study was split into numerous factors across three categories that indicate how family-friendly a location is. These factors included essentials that affect city livability, such as housing, education, employment rates, and general affordability, as well as family legislation, including the amount of paid parental leave and whether a city is inclusive for same-sex parents. 

It was important to include the opinions of the families who experience these cities themselves, so two surveys of parents in each location were commissioned to gain a measurement of public sentiment towards them. The first survey asked parents to indicate how they felt about their children's safety in the community, and the second surveyed whether they believed that their city was a good place for families in general.

Last but not least, the study looked at the attractiveness and breadth of a city's family-oriented leisure activities. The final index combines all of these factors to determine the top cities around the world that offer the best conditions to raise a family.
