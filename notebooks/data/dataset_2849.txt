TuningSVMs 
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics, Study 

This is a meta-dataset describing the Support Vector Machine hyperparameter tuning problem. The target attribute indicates whether tuning is required or default hyperparameter values are sufficient for each dataset (row). Targets were defined using a statistical labeling rule comparing the predictive performance of models induced with default values and tuned ones. 

In this version of the dataset, the labeling rule was set with high confidence. Features characterizing the datasets include the number of classes, attributes, numeric and nominal variables, samples, dimensionality, and rates of numeric and nominal variables. Additionally, there are features related to symbols, class probabilities, skewness, kurtosis, correlation, entropy, joint entropy, mutual information, equivalent attributes, noise signal ratio, and nodes and leaves in decision trees.

Other features include leaf corroboration, level and branch characteristics, attribute statistics, and Naive Bayes and nearest neighbor performance metrics. There are also features related to density-based clustering, network characteristics such as edges, degree, density, maximum component size, closeness, betweenness, clustering coefficient, hubs, and average path length. The ultimate goal is to predict whether tuning is necessary or not.
