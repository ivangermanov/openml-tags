QSAR-TID-10526 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Delta Opioid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP features.
