Subsampling of the dataset KC One with seed equals zero, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in self, seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and stratified as parameters. It returns a dataset. It uses numpy's random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects the features and target from the dataset. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes using random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the features and target accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses train test split with stratification to sample the rows. Finally, it returns a new dataset with the subsampled features and target.
