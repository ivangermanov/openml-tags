QSAR-TID-10980 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10980. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 5766 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and lymph vessel development. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation.

The receptor is a key player in the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, which regulates angiogenesis, cell migration, and cell proliferation. It is also involved in the regulation of blood vessel development, hematopoiesis, and lung development.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2, which can aid in the discovery of new therapeutic compounds for various diseases.
