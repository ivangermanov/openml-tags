QSAR-TID-12895 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12895. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 547 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The dataset is related to the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is also known as GPRC1B, GRM2, mGluR2, and MGLUR2. The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including cell communication, signal transduction, and synaptic transmission.

The receptor is a target for various compounds, including DECOGLURANT, LY2979165, LY404039, POMAGLUMETAD METHIONIL, and JNJ-40411813. These compounds have different mechanisms of action, including modulators, agonists, and positive allosteric modulators.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is involved in various diseases, including neurological disorders.
