The QSAR-TID-12895 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12895. It has 547 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015. 

This dataset contains information about Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2, which is a single protein preferred name. It is also known as GPRC1B, GRM2, Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2, mGluR2, MGLUR2. 

It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under the category of 1. Membrane receptor/Family C G protein-coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family C GPCR)/Neurotransmitter receptor (family C GPCR)/Metabotropic glutamate receptor.

There are several synonyms associated with this receptor, including 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A/Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2.
