The QSAR-TID-20014 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 20014. It has 2625 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR models and datasets for various biological targets.

The drug target, TID 20014, is also known as Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase Aurora-A, which belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group. It plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis.

The compounds in this dataset have been tested for their inhibitory activity against Aurora-A, with activity values represented as pseudo-pCI50. The molecular fingerprints were generated using the FCFP 1024bit method, which captures structural information about each compound.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working on developing new inhibitors of Aurora-A, which has been implicated in various types of cancer.
