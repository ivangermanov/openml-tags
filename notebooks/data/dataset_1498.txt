South Africa Heart Disease Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

This dataset represents a retrospective sample of males in a high-risk region for heart disease in the Western Cape, South Africa. The sample consists of roughly two controls per case of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). It is important to note that many of the CHD-positive men had undergone blood pressure reduction treatment and other programs aimed at reducing their risk factors after their CHD event. In some instances, the measurements were taken after these treatments.

The attributes included in this dataset are:

* Systolic Blood Pressure
* Cumulative Tobacco Consumption (in kilograms)
* Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol
* Adiposity
* Family History of Heart Disease (present or absent)
* Type-A Behavior
* Obesity
* Current Alcohol Consumption
* Age at Onset
* Response, which indicates whether the individual has Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

This dataset was extracted from a larger dataset described in the South African Medical Journal.
