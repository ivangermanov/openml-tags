Title: South Africa Heart Disease Dataset

Description: This dataset comprises a retrospective sample of males from a heart disease high risk region in the Western Cape, South Africa. The data includes approximately two controls for each case of coronary heart disease (CHD). Many of the CHD positive individuals have undergone various treatments to reduce their risk factors, including blood pressure reduction programs, following their CHD event. In some instances, the measurements were taken after these interventions had been implemented. The dataset is a subset of a larger collection, which was originally detailed in the South African Medical Journal.
