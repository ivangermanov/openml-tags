MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Eighteen Thousand Thirteen, and it has thirty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints.
