The BNG (Tic-Tac-Toe) dataset is a collection of tic-tac-toe game states and their corresponding classifications. It is designed for artificial intelligence and machine learning studies, particularly in the areas of game theory and decision-making algorithms. The dataset includes various game board configurations, represented by the state of each square on the tic-tac-toe grid. These features allow for comprehensive analysis of game strategies and outcomes. The inclusion of mythbusting and study tags suggests that this dataset may be used to challenge common assumptions about tic-tac-toe gameplay and to conduct in-depth research on game dynamics.
