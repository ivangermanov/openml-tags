Name: QSAR Biodeg Seed One Subsample

Tags: Subsampling of the QSAR Biodeg dataset with seed one

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using uniform random sampling. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, selecting a specified number of columns from the filtered data. If the number of rows in the filtered data exceeds the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is maintained.

The resulting dataset is then returned with the selected features, target variable, and categorical mask.

Features: 

QSAR Biodeg dataset features are not human-readable and are skipped.
