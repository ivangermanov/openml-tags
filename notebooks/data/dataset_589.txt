This is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive and all others as negative. This conversion results in a binary classification problem where instances are labeled as either positive or negative. The original dataset has been modified to create this new version, which is suitable for binarized regression analysis.

The dataset consists of numerous features, including various chemical compounds and their properties. These features are essential in understanding the underlying relationships between the variables and the target outcome. Although the feature names may not be easily interpretable, they represent crucial aspects of the chemistry and life science domains.
