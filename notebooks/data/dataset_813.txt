Fri C Three Thousand Five Dataset: A Binarized Regression Problem

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification results in a binary class system where instances are categorized as either Positive or Negative.

The dataset is related to chemistry and life science studies, and is part of several studies including Myth Busting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, and Study Forty-One.

Features of this dataset include ozone related variables, although the exact meaning of these features is not clearly defined.
