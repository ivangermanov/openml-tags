Past Usage:

Predicted price of car using all numeric and Boolean attributes 
Method: an instance-based learning algorithm derived from a localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm 
Compared with a linear regression prediction so all instances with missing attribute values were discarded 
This resulted with a training set of instances, which was also used as a test set minus the actual instance during testing 

Results:

Percent Average Deviation Error of Prediction from Actual 
Instance-Based Learning Algorithm 
Linear Regression Equation

Description 

This data set consists of three types of entities: the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, its assigned insurance risk rating, and its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars 
The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates 
Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price 
Then, if it is more risky or less, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up or down the scale 
Actuarians call this process symboling 
A value of plus three indicates that the auto is risky, minus three that it is probably pretty safe 
The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year 
This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification, and represents the average loss per car per year 

Note:

Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a class attribute
