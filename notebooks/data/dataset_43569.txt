The 1985 Auto Imports Database is a comprehensive collection of information about various car models, including their specifications, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses in use.

Source Information

This database was created using multiple sources, including the 1985 Model Import Car and Truck Specifications from Ward's Automotive Yearbook, Personal Auto Manuals from the Insurance Services Office, and the Insurance Collision Report from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Past Usage

This dataset has been used in various studies, including instance-based prediction of real-valued attributes, where the goal was to predict the price of a car using all numeric and Boolean attributes. The method used was an instance-based learning algorithm derived from a localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which was compared to a linear regression prediction. The results showed a percent average deviation error of prediction from actual of 11.84 for the instance-based learning algorithm and 14.12 for the linear regression equation.

Relevant Information

This dataset consists of three types of entities: the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, its assigned insurance risk rating, and its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The insurance risk rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates, with a value of +3 indicating that the auto is risky and -3 indicating that it is probably pretty safe. The normalized losses in use represent the average loss per car per year, normalized for all autos within a particular size classification.

Number of Instances and Attributes

The dataset contains 205 instances and 26 attributes, including 15 continuous, 1 integer, and 10 nominal attributes.

Attribute Information

The attributes include symboling, normalized losses, make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak RPM, city MPG, highway MPG, and price.
