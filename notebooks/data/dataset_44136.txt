Wine Quality Dataset 

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. 

The original dataset was created by transforming the Wine Quality dataset, which consists of two datasets, one for red wine and another for white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests, such as pH values, and the output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert grades the wine quality between zero, very bad, and ten, very excellent.

Several data mining methods have been applied to model these datasets under a regression approach, with the support vector machine model achieving the best results. Various metrics were computed, including Mean Absolute Deviation and confusion matrices for a fixed error tolerance. Additionally, the relative importance of the input variables was plotted, as measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure.

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. Due to privacy and logistical issues, only physiochemical and sensory variables are available, excluding data about grape types, wine brands, wine selling prices, and so forth. These datasets can be viewed as either classification or regression tasks, with the classes being ordered and not balanced, meaning there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. 

Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. It would also be interesting to test feature selection methods, as it is unclear whether all input variables are relevant. Furthermore, several of the attributes may be correlated, making it sensible to apply some form of feature selection.

The dataset consists of eleven input variables based on physiochemical tests, and one output variable based on sensory data. The input variables include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The output variable is the quality of the wine, scored between zero and ten.
