The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

These datasets are named according to their characteristics, specifically their level of colinearity and sample size, as well as the number of features they contain. 

The Friedman function, which is widely used for generating data, includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

This function can be represented as an equation, where the output variable is determined by five input variables, with some interactions between them, plus an error term. 

To test the effects of unrelated features, additional features that do not affect the output are added to the datasets. Furthermore, to evaluate an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying levels of interdependence between features.

The parameters and values used to generate these Friedman datasets are as follows: the number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five are actually related to the output; the number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand; and the colinearity degree, which represents the number of features dependent on others, varies from zero to four.

As a result, a total of eighty artificial datasets were generated by combining different numbers of features, sample sizes, and colinearity degrees. 

In each file, the last attribute is the target variable.
