California Housing Classification Tags: Binarized version of the California Housing Dataset

This dataset was obtained from Luis Torgo's collection of regression datasets. It was binarized to serve as the original, unprocessed data for the California Housing dataset used in various studies.

Description:
This is a dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. The dataset contains information on various variables collected from all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. A block group, on average, includes a geographically compact area with a population of approximately 1425.5 individuals. The geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. Distances among the centroids of each block group were computed as measured in latitude and longitude. All block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables were excluded. The final data contained observations on nine variables. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the median house value.

The dataset includes variables such as median income, median age of housing, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude. The data were collected to study the relationship between these variables and the median house value.
