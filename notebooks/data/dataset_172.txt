Space Shuttle Autolanding Domain

Tags: mythbusting, study, uci

Past Usage: This dataset has been used in several studies, including a publication in The Universal Turing Machine: A Half-Century Survey by Oxford University Press.

Relevant Information: This is a small database focused on autolanding systems for spacecraft. The data was used to generate comprehensible rules for determining when automatic landing would be preferable to manual control of the spacecraft.

Number of Instances: Fifteen

Number of Attributes: Seven (including the class attribute)

Attribute Information:
- Class: Noauto, Auto (advising manual or automatic control)
- Stability: Stable, Extremely Stable
- Error: Extra Large, Large Extra, Medium Medium, Small Small
- Sign: Positive Positive, Negative Negative
- Wind: Headwind, Tailwind
- Magnitude: Low, Medium, Strong, Out of Range
- Visibility: Yes, No

Missing Attribute Values: None, but several "don't care" values are present, denoted by asterisks. These occur in various attributes, with different frequencies.

Class Distribution:
- Use manual control: Six instances
- Use automatic control: Nine instances

Information about the dataset:
Class type: Nominal
Class index: First

Features: Class, Stability, Error, Sign, Wind, Magnitude, Visibility

This dataset provides valuable insights into the decision-making process for spacecraft landing procedures, balancing the benefits of automatic systems against human control in various conditions. The attributes cover a range of factors that influence the choice between manual and automatic landing, including stability, error margins, wind conditions, and visibility. The presence of "don't care" values in certain attributes suggests that some factors may be less critical in specific scenarios, allowing for a nuanced approach to landing decisions.
