Wine Quality White Seed One Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Wine Quality White dataset, containing two thousand rows. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the resulting dataset has an equal distribution of classes. 

The dataset contains ten classes, which were chosen based on their value counts in the original dataset. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the instances that belong to these classes. 

Furthermore, the dataset underwent column sampling, where one hundred columns were randomly selected from the original dataset. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential characteristics.

The dataset is suitable for machine learning and mathematical modeling tasks, particularly those involving classification problems.
