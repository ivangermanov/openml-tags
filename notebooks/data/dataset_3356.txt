QSAR-TID-103910 Dataset: Machine Learning, Meteorology, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103910. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and consists of fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by a series of molecular fingerprint features.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred three thousand nine hundred ten. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and consists of fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.
