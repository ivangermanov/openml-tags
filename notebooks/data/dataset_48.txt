The 1984 United States Congressional Voting Records Database includes votes for each of the US House of Representatives congressmen on the sixteen key votes identified by the Congressional Quarterly Almanac. These votes were categorized into nine different types, including voted for, paired for, and announced for, which were simplified to "yes", voted against, paired against, and announced against, which were simplified to "no", voted present, voted present to avoid conflict of interest, and did not vote or otherwise make a position known, which were simplified to an unknown disposition.

This dataset has four hundred thirty-five instances, consisting of two hundred sixty-seven Democrats and one hundred sixty-eight Republicans. There are seventeen attributes, including the class name, which indicates whether the congressman is a Democrat or Republican. The other sixteen attributes represent the sixteen key votes, each having a value of either "yes" or "no".

The dataset has missing values, denoted by "?", which do not indicate that the value of the attribute is unknown, but rather that the value is not "yes" or "no". There are varying numbers of missing values for each attribute, ranging from zero to twenty-eight.

The class distribution is forty-five point two percent Democrats and fifty-four point eight percent Republicans. Each attribute has been analyzed for its predictiveness and predictability, providing insight into how well each attribute predicts the class and vice versa.

The dataset provides valuable information for studying congressional voting patterns and can be used to develop models that predict a congressman's party affiliation based on their voting record.
