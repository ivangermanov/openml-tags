The Teaching Assistant Evaluation dataset contains evaluations of teaching performance over three regular semesters and two summer semesters for teaching assistant assignments at the Statistics Department of the University of Wisconsin Madison. The scores were categorized into three roughly equal sized groups: low, medium, and high, which form the class variable.

The dataset consists of evaluations for teaching assistant assignments. It includes information on whether the teaching assistant is a native English speaker, the course instructor, the specific course, whether it was a summer or regular semester, the class size, and the overall evaluation category.

The data was collected and donated for research purposes. It has been used in studies comparing prediction accuracy, complexity, and training time of various classification algorithms. The dataset provides relevant information for analyzing factors that may influence teaching assistant performance evaluations.

There are no missing attribute values in this dataset. The class type is nominal, with the class index being the last attribute. The features include native English speaker status, course instructor, course, semester type, class size, and the final evaluation category.

This dataset offers opportunities to explore relationships between various factors and teaching performance ratings. It could be valuable for educational research, performance prediction, and understanding influences on student evaluations of teaching assistants in higher education settings.
