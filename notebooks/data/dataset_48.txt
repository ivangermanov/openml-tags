Teaching Assistant Evaluation

The data set consists of evaluations of teaching performance over three regular semesters and two summer semesters of one hundred fifty-one teaching assistant assignments at the Statistics Department of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The scores were divided into three roughly equal-sized categories, namely low, medium, and high, to form the class variable.

The sources of this data set include the collector and the donor. The collector was responsible for gathering the data, while the donor contributed to the data set by providing access to the necessary resources.

Past usage of this data set includes its application in several studies. One such study compared the prediction accuracy, complexity, and training time of thirty-three old and new classification algorithms. Another study used split selection methods for classification trees.

This data set contains one hundred fifty-one instances, each representing a unique teaching assistant assignment. There are six attributes in total, including the class attribute. The attributes include whether or not the teaching assistant is a native English speaker, course instructor, course, summer or regular semester, class size, and class attribute.

There are no missing attribute values in this data set. The class type is nominal, and the class index is the last feature. The features are an essential part of the data set, as they provide valuable information about each instance.

Additional information about the data set reveals that it has been used extensively in various studies. The data set has been cited in several publications, and its relevance is evident in the field of education.
