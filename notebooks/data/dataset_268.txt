This is one of forty-one drug design datasets. The datasets with eleven hundred forty-three features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. 

The original studies include Carbolenes, which examines the relationship between molecular descriptors and biological activity. Another study is MTP two, which investigates the influence of molecular descriptors on melting points and their role in classification of solid drugs.

Other datasets include Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama one, and Yokoyama two. These studies focus on various aspects of drug design, including molecular diversity, melting point prediction, and quantitative structure-activity relationships.

Additionally, there are datasets such as Benzo thirty-two, which explores the syntheses, pharmacological evaluation, and molecular modeling of substituted six-alkoxyimidazo one-two-b pyridazines as new ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor.

Phenetyle one examines the quantitative structure-activity relationships of Hansch analysis and related approaches. Pah investigates weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors and their application to modeling physicochemical properties of polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

Pdgfr develops linear, ensemble, and nonlinear models for the prediction and interpretation of biological activity of a set of platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors.

Phen examines interrelationships of regression models used for structure-activity analyses. Topo two-one and Yprop four-one predict toxicology through benchmarking molecular descriptors and statistical methods.

Qsabr one and Qsabr two compare quantitative structure-activity relationships models for toxicity and biodegradability of anilines and phenols. Qsartox develops quantitative structure-activity relationships for acute toxicity of saturated and unsaturated halogenated aliphatic compounds.

Qsbr Rw one examines structure-biodegradability relationships for chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. Qsbr Y two develops a mechanistic approach to deriving quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships. Qsbr Alks investigates mechanism-based quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships for hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro- and bromo-alkenes.

Qsfr Dhla examines quantitative structure-function relationships of single-point mutants of haloalkane dehalogenase. Qsfsr one and Qsfsr two develop quantitative structure-function and structure-stability relationships of purposely modified proteins.

Qspr Cmpx explores stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion through quantitative structure-property relationships. Selwood examines structure-activity relationships of antifilarial antimycin analogues through multivariate pattern recognition study.

Keywords: drug design, molecular descriptors, biological activity, quantitative structure-activity relationships, melting point prediction, biodegradability, toxicity, pharmacological evaluation, molecular modeling.
