The Solar Flare Database 

This database contains three potential classes, each representing the number of times a specific type of solar flare occurred in a twenty-four-hour period. Each instance represents captured features for one active region on the Sun.

The data is divided into two sections. The second section, which has undergone more error correction, is considered more reliable.

The database includes thirteen attributes, including three class attributes. 

Attribute information includes:

* Code for class, which is a modified Zurich class 
* Code for largest spot size 
* Code for spot distribution 
* Activity level, which is either reduced or unchanged 
* Evolution, which can be either decay, no growth, or growth 
* Previous twenty-four-hour flare activity code, which indicates whether there was nothing as big as an M1, one M1, or more activity than one M1 
* Whether the region is historically complex 
* Whether the region became historically complex on this pass across the Sun's disk 
* Area, which is either small or large 
* Area of the largest spot, which is either less than or equal to five or greater than five 

From these predictors, three classes of flares are predicted, which are represented in the last three columns. These classes include:

* C-class flares production by this region in the next twenty-four hours, which are common flares 
* M-class flares production by this region in the next twenty-four hours, which are moderate flares 
* X-class flares production by this region in the next twenty-four hours, which are severe flares
