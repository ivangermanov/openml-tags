Cardiac Arrhythmia Database 

The aim of this database is to determine the type of arrhythmia from electrocardiogram recordings. This database contains two hundred seventy-nine attributes, two hundred six of which are linear valued and the rest are nominal.

Concerning the study, the aim is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to classify it into one of sixteen groups. Class one refers to normal electrocardiogram classes, classes two to fifteen refer to different classes of arrhythmia, and class sixteen refers to the rest of unclassified ones.

For the time being, there exists a computer program that makes such a classification. However, there are differences between the cardiologist's and the program's classification. Taking the cardiologist's as a gold standard, we aim to minimize this difference by means of machine learning tools.

The database contains information about patients, including their age, sex, height, weight, QRS duration, P-R interval, Q-T interval, T interval, P interval, vector angles, and heart rate. Additionally, it includes information about the average width of various waves, including Q wave, R wave, S wave, R' wave, S' wave, and others, as well as the existence of certain characteristics, such as ragged R wave, diphasic derivation of R wave, and others.

There are also amplitude values for various waves, including JJ wave, Q wave, R wave, S wave, R' wave, S' wave, P wave, and T wave. Furthermore, the database includes information about the sum of areas of all segments divided by ten and other calculations related to wave forms.

Class labels include normal, ischemic changes, old anterior myocardial infarction, old inferior myocardial infarction, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, ventricular premature contraction, supraventricular premature contraction, left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, first-degree atrioventricular block, second-degree atrioventricular block, third-degree atrioventricular block, left ventricle hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and others.
