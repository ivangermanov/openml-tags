This dataset pertains to a chess endgame scenario involving King+Rook versus King+Pawn on a7 (commonly abbreviated as KRKPA7). The pawn's position on a7 indicates it is one square away from queening. It is White's turn to move, with White controlling the King+Rook.

The dataset was originally generated and described by an expert in the field. It has been used in various studies related to structured induction in expert systems, concept learning, and machine learning. The data has been utilized in academic publications and research papers focusing on knowledge structuring and problem-solving in artificial intelligence.

The dataset comprises board descriptions for this specific chess endgame. Each instance represents a unique board position, described by attributes that characterize the state of the game. The classification task is to determine whether White can win or cannot win from the given position.

There are two possible class labels: "won" (White can win) and "nowin" (White cannot win). It is believed that White is considered unable to win if the Black pawn can safely advance on the board.

The dataset contains instances, with each instance represented as a sequence of attribute values. The first attributes describe the board configuration, while the last attribute provides the classification. There are no missing values in the dataset.

The features in the dataset correspond to various aspects of the chess position, including piece placements, potential moves, and strategic considerations. These features are represented in a specific order within each instance.

In terms of class distribution, approximately of the positions allow White to win, while in the remaining positions, White cannot secure a victory. This relatively balanced distribution adds to the dataset's suitability for machine learning tasks.

The dataset has been formatted to align with other databases in the UCI repository of machine learning datasets, ensuring consistency and ease of use for researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
