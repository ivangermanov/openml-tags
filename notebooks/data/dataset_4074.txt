The QSAR-TID-11891 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11891. This dataset has 121 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The target classification is one point membrane receptor, family C G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, neurotransmitter receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor four, also known as mGluR four.

This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including cell communication, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled glutamate receptor signaling pathway, and synaptic transmission.

It is also involved in the regulation of cell population proliferation, learning, and neuronal apoptotic process. Additionally, it plays a role in the negative regulation of apoptotic process and positive regulation of MAPK cascade.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, metabotropic glutamate receptor, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, synaptic transmission, cell communication.
