The QSAR-TID-11249 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 11249. This dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It shows activity values, measured in pseudo-pCI fifty units, of several compounds on the drug target TID: 11249. The features of this dataset include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, followed by many FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The drug target TID: 11249 is also known as the serotonin four receptor, five hydroxytryptamine receptor four, or five-HT four R. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, monoamine receptor, and serotonin receptor. This receptor is involved in many biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of appetite, and G protein-coupled serotonin receptor signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, serotonin receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction, chemical synaptic transmission.
