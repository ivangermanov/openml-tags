QSAR-TID-11249 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11249. The dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11249. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Serotonin four receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as five-HT four receptor, five-hydroxytryptamine receptor four, and Serotonin receptor four. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of appetite, and G protein-coupled serotonin receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Serotonin four receptor. It can be used to develop and validate QSAR models, which can predict the activity of new compounds on the receptor.
