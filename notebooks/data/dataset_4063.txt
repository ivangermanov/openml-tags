Pol Dataset 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the "regression on numerical features" benchmark and has been transformed in the same manner as the other datasets in the tabular data benchmark. It originates from a commercial application described in an academic paper, specifically dealing with a telecommunications problem, but unfortunately, no further information is available regarding its context.

The dataset consists of a substantial number of cases, accompanied by forty-nine continuous attributes. It was sourced from a comprehensive collection of regression datasets compiled by Luis Torgo, accessible online.

For those interested in accessing the original data, it can be obtained from the original source website.
