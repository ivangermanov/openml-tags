QSAR-TID-245 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Renal Dipeptidase, and it has twenty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Renal Dipeptidase. Renal Dipeptidase is a single protein, also known as Beta-lactamase Dehydropeptidase-I, Dipeptidase one, and hRDP. It is an enzyme, a protease, a metallo protease, and a metallo protease M nineteen family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The features of the dataset include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and one thousand twenty-four FCFP six features, which are molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings. These features are used to describe the molecular structure of the compounds and are used as input for QSAR models.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in Renal Dipeptidase as a drug target.
