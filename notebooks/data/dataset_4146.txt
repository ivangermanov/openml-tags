Pol dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark and is part of the tabular data benchmark. The original dataset has been transformed in a specific way for this benchmark.

The Pol dataset is a binarized version of an original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean of the target values and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset contains a range of features, including several numerical features.

The Pol dataset is intended for use in machine learning applications and is particularly suited to regression tasks involving numerical features.
