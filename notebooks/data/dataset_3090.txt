QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is associated with the MetaQSAR project from September. It focuses on the Neurokinin receptor, also known as Neurokinin A receptor, NK R, NK receptor, SKR, and Substance K receptor. This protein target is found in Rattus norvegicus and is classified as a Membrane receptor/Family A G protein coupled receptor/Peptide receptor/Short peptide receptor/Neurokinin receptor.

The Neurokinin receptor is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, tachykinin receptor signaling pathway, regulation of acetylcholine secretion and neurotransmission, intestine smooth muscle contraction, regulation of luteinizing hormone secretion, operant conditioning, regulation of vascular permeability, regulation of monoatomic ion transport, response to electrical stimulus, prolactin secretion, regulation of uterine smooth muscle contraction, and regulation of flagellated sperm motility.

This receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane, sperm flagellum, sperm head, and sperm midpiece. Its functions include G protein coupled receptor activity, tachykinin receptor activity, and substance K receptor activity.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies related to this important drug target. It can be used to develop predictive models for compound activity and aid in drug discovery efforts targeting the Neurokinin receptor.
