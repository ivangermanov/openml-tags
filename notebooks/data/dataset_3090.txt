This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Neurokinin Two Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent Folded Chemical Functionality-Class Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, Folded Chemical Functionality-Class Fingerprints, and many more.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically from September Two Thousand Fifteen.
