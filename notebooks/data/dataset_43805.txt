Daily Electricity Price and Demand Data

Tags: Content

As of the current year, Victoria, Australia's second most populated state, is home to approximately six point seven million people. The majority of them, around five million, reside or work in Melbourne, the state's capital. During the pandemic, Australia was among the first countries to close international borders, followed by a closure of interstate borders. Victoria introduced some of the strictest pandemic-related restrictions on business activity, resulting in a significant portion of its population working from home.

The dataset covers a period of one thousand nine hundred and sixteen days between January first, two thousand and fifteen, and October sixth, two thousand and twenty. During some intraday intervals, the Recommended Retail Price was negative, meaning that energy producers were paying consumers rather than the other way around.

Below is a brief description of the data:

Date refers to the date of the recording. Demand represents the total daily electricity demand in megawatt-hours. Recommended Retail Price is the recommended retail price in Australian dollars per megawatt-hour. Demand at Positive Recommended Retail Price is the total daily demand at positive Recommended Retail Price in megawatt-hours. Average Positive Recommended Retail Price is the averaged positive Recommended Retail Price, weighted by the corresponding intraday demand in Australian dollars per megawatt-hour. Demand at Negative Recommended Retail Price is the total daily demand at negative Recommended Retail Price in megawatt-hours. Average Negative Recommended Retail Price is the average negative Recommended Retail Price, weighted by the corresponding intraday demand in Australian dollars per megawatt-hour. Fraction of the Day at Negative Recommended Retail Price is the fraction of the day when the demand was traded at negative Recommended Retail Price. Minimum Temperature is the minimum temperature during the day in Celsius. Maximum Temperature is the maximum temperature during the day in Celsius. Solar Exposure is the total daily sunlight energy in megajoules per square meter. Rainfall is the daily rainfall in millimeters. School Day is a boolean indicating whether students were at school on that day. Holiday is a boolean indicating whether the day was a state or national holiday.
