Daily Electricity Price and Demand Data

As of the current year, approximately six point seven million people reside in Victoria, Australia's second most populated state. A significant majority of them, roughly five million, live or work in Melbourne, the state's capital city. During the global health crisis, Australia was one of the first countries to implement strict measures, including closing international borders, followed by the closure of interstate borders. Victoria, in particular, introduced some of the strictest pandemic-related restrictions on business activity, resulting in a significant portion of its population being forced to work from home.

The dataset covers a period of one thousand nine hundred sixteen days, spanning from January First, Two Thousand Fifteen, to October Sixth, Two Thousand Twenty. Interestingly, during certain intraday intervals, the Recommended Retail Price was negative, meaning that energy producers were essentially paying consumers instead of the other way around.

Below is a brief description of the data:

Date represents the date of the recording. Demand refers to the total daily electricity demand in megawatt-hours. Recommended Retail Price represents the recommended retail price in Australian dollars per megawatt-hour. Demand at Positive Recommended Retail Price is the total daily demand at positive Recommended Retail Price in megawatt-hours. Average Positive Recommended Retail Price is the averaged positive Recommended Retail Price, weighted by the corresponding intraday demand in Australian dollars per megawatt-hour. Demand at Negative Recommended Retail Price represents the total daily demand at negative Recommended Retail Price in megawatt-hours. Average Negative Recommended Retail Price is the average negative Recommended Retail Price, weighted by the corresponding intraday demand in Australian dollars per megawatt-hour. Fraction of Day at Negative Recommended Retail Price is the fraction of the day when the demand was traded at negative Recommended Retail Price. Minimum Temperature represents the minimum temperature during the day in degrees Celsius. Maximum Temperature represents the maximum temperature during the day in degrees Celsius. Solar Exposure represents the total daily sunlight energy in megajoules per square meter. Rainfall represents the daily rainfall in millimeters. School Day is a boolean indicating whether students were at school on that day. Holiday is a boolean indicating whether the day was a state or national holiday.
