The Features and Price of Computer Components dataset provides information about various computer hardware components available on the Newegg website, a popular online marketplace for buying PC parts, laptops, electronics, and more. This dataset aims to help determine the best component with the best price.

To collect the data, web scraping was implemented using Python and Selenium, extracting information about central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), power supplies, random access memory (RAM), monitors, and storage devices. The extracted data includes:

* Brand name
* Item description
* Ratings
* Prices
* Category (such as CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, power supply, and storage)

This dataset can be useful for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and preprocess the data, followed by building predictive models for prices or assumption analysis.
