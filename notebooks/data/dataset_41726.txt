FOREX aud/usd Day High Dataset 

Tags: Finance, Forex, Forex Day, Forex High, Health, Statistics 

Data Description 

This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex Australian Dollar/United States Dollar exchange rate obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a single daily candlestick. The dataset spans a period from January to December, excluding weekends when the Forex market is closed. The timestamp feature adheres to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high bid and ask prices of the subsequent day relative to the mean high bid and ask prices of the current day. In other words, the class attribute assumes a true value when the mean high price is expected to increase the following day, and a false value when the mean high price is anticipated to decrease or remain stagnant.

Please note that this is a hypothetical task intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trading strategies should only be applied to predictions based on close attributes, which are also available in the dataset.
