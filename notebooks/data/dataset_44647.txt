Name: King-Rook versus King-Pawn Seed Four

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset King-Rook versus King-Pawn with seed equal to four

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes from the unique classes in the dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

The function then uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns randomly. It then filters the data to include only the selected columns.

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data accordingly. It concatenates the data and target, and then uses train test split to select the required number of rows. It then filters the data to include only the selected rows.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string for OpenML and returns a dataset with the filtered data, target, categorical mask, and columns.
