QSAR-TID-10209 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10209. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset contains a total of one thousand and twenty-six features, including the molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXC50.

The drug target TID: 10209 is a serotonin seven receptor, which is a type of G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and neurotransmitter receptor activity.

The serotonin seven receptor is a target for various small molecule antagonists, which are being developed as potential therapeutic agents. The receptor is also involved in various diseases, including circadian rhythm disorders and vasoconstriction.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It provides a comprehensive collection of activity data for various compounds on the serotonin seven receptor, which can be used to develop predictive models and identify potential lead compounds.
