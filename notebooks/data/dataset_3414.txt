This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10209, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically study three, and it should be cited accordingly. It provides valuable information for researchers studying the Serotonin seven receptor, also known as five-HT seven receptor, which is a single protein found in humans. This receptor is classified as a one membrane receptor and family A G protein-coupled receptor, specifically a small molecule receptor belonging to the monoamine receptor family.

The dataset includes multiple compounds with their corresponding activity values, as well as information about the target classification, description, and synonyms. It also provides links to other relevant datasets and resources, including ChEMBL, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro.
