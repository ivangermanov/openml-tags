Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers. The final feature is binaryClass.

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involved calculating the mean value of the target variable and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean threshold. This binarization approach allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset includes numerous features, each prefixed with "oz" and a number, suggesting they may represent different measurements or attributes related to the subject matter being studied. The final feature, labeled "binaryClass," likely represents the newly created binary target variable resulting from the binarization process.

This dataset appears to be intended for use in machine learning and data analysis tasks, particularly those involving binary classification problems. It may be useful for researchers and data scientists working on predictive modeling or pattern recognition in various fields of study.
