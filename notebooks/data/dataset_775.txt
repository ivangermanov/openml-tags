The SocMob dataset is a binarized regression problem related to Chemistry and Life Sciences, specifically focusing on debunking myths and conducting studies.

This dataset is a modified version of the original data, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The features of this dataset include Father's Occupation, Son's Occupation, Family Structure, Race, and Counts for Son's First Occupation, which are used to determine the binary classification.
