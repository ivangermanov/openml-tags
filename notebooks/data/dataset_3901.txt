QSAR-TID-30023 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor Protein Two. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Features:

* Molecule ChEMBL ID
* FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. The data was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen.

Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor Protein Two is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including ACK One, Activated CDC Forty-Two Kinase One, and TNK Two. It is an enzyme belonging to the protein kinase group and tyrosine protein kinase Ack family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, endocytosis, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, small GTPase mediated signal transduction, and phosphorylation. It is also involved in the regulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis.

Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor Protein Two is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, endosome, cytosol, plasma membrane, clathrin-coated pit, adherens junction, membrane, clathrin-coated vesicle, cytoplasmic vesicle membrane, cytoplasmic vesicle, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, anchoring junction, and Grb Two-EGFR complex.
