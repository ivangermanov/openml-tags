QSAR-TID-30023 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor Protein 2, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor Protein 2. This protein is also known as ACK1, Activated CDC42 Kinase 1, and TNK2. It is a single protein and its preferred name is Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor Protein 2. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, endocytosis, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and small GTPase mediated signal transduction. It is also involved in the regulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is a valuable resource for researchers studying the activity of compounds on Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor Protein 2.
