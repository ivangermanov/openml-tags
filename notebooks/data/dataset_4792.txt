This dataset provides a realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Puma 560 robot arm. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the angular acceleration of one of the robot arm's links, which is a highly nonlinear task with significant noise levels. The simulator takes into account various inputs, including the angular positions, velocities, and torques, as well as other dynamic parameters of the Puma arm.

The dataset consists of several attributes that describe the robot arm's dynamics. These include the angular positions of links one to six, represented by theta one through theta six; the angular velocities of links one to six, denoted by theta d one through theta d six; the torques applied at joints one to five, represented by tau one through tau five; and changes in mass, length, and viscous friction of links one to five, denoted by dm one through dm five, da one through da five, and db one through db five, respectively. The ultimate goal is to predict the acceleration of link six, represented by theta dd six.
