QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Serine/threonine protein kinase PAK, also known as KIAA, p activated kinase, p activated kinase, PAK, and PAK. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE family/STE protein kinase PAKB subfamily.

The protein is associated with various cellular components including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, cytosol, plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and synapse. Its functions involve nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine kinase activity.

The biological processes involving this protein include regulation of cell growth, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, cytoskeleton organization, signal transduction, learning, memory, locomotory behavior, cell population proliferation, phosphorylation, cell migration, intracellular signal transduction, regulation of MAPK cascade, and negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway.

The protein is referenced in various databases including Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is involved in several molecular processes such as Activation of RAC, CDC GTPase cycle, RAC GTPase cycle, RHOD GTPase cycle, and RHOH GTPase cycle.
