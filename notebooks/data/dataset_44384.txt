Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. 

First, it samples the classes uniformly, selecting the indices where one of the chosen classes is present. Then, it samples the columns uniformly if required. 

If the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly, using the target name and the random state from the seed. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string for OpenML and returns a new dataset with the sampled data, categorical mask, and columns.
