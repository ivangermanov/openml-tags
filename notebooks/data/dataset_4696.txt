The Adult Seed One Dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of arguments, resulting in a new dataset with distinct characteristics.

Tags: Subsampling of the Adult Dataset with Seed One

This dataset was generated using the following source code:

A function named subsample takes in several parameters, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification.

Within this function, a random number generator is created using the provided seed value. The input data is then split into features and targets. 

If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, a subset of classes is randomly selected, taking into account their frequencies in the original data. 

The function then selects the indices corresponding to these chosen classes and filters the input data accordingly. 

Next, if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of columns is made, ensuring that the resulting dataset meets the specified column limit.

Finally, if the resulting dataset still contains more rows than the maximum allowed, the function employs stratified sampling to reduce the number of rows while maintaining the original class distribution.

The resulting dataset consists of the following features: Age, Work Class, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship, Race, Sex, Capital Gain, Capital Loss, Hours per Week, Native Country, and Class.
