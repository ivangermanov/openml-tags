League of Legends Diamond Games (First Fifteen Minutes)

Tags: Context

Inspired by the following dataset, we have a collection of data on the first fifteen minutes of Diamond ranked League of Legends matches scraped using Riot's Application Programming Interface. Can we predict their outcomes?

Data
All matches were collected with the following parameters: Season, Server, and Rank. The server used was North America One, and the rank was Diamond Tier, specifically Tier One, Tier Two, Tier Three, and Tier Four.

Acknowledgements
We would like to extend our gratitude to Riot Games for allowing access to their Application Programming Interface.

Inspiration
When working on the linked dataset above, we noticed that classification accuracy peaked around a certain point. Given that we have a significantly larger amount of data, we wanted to explore how this would improve our results.

Features
The dataset includes information such as match identification, the outcome of the match in terms of which team won, gold earned by each team, minions killed by each team, jungle minions killed by each team, the average level of each team, champion kills, herald kills, dragon kills, and towers destroyed by each team.
