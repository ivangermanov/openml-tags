The Adoptable Dogs Dataset 

This dataset was created during a web scraping exercise. 

The data comprises a collection of information about dogs available for adoption on a specific date in the Hungarian Database of Homeless Pets. 

In total, the database contained information about a large number of dogs. 

It includes details about each dog's name, breed, color, age, gender, the date they were discovered, and various aspects of their personality.

I found it intriguing to create a dataset focused on the characteristics of adoptable dogs. While not ideal for predictive modeling, this dataset serves as an excellent practice resource for data visualization and handling categorical data.

Features include identification, name, age, gender, breed, discovery date, availability for adoption, posting date, color, coat type, size, spay/neuter status, housebreaking status, affinity for humans, affinity for children, compatibility with male dogs, compatibility with female dogs, tolerance for cats, and suitability for keeping indoors.
