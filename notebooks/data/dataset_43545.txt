Adoptable Dogs Tags: Context

This dataset was created as a result of practicing web scraping. The content of the dataset is a compilation of information on dogs that were available for adoption on a specific date. The dataset contains information on a wide range of characteristics of these dogs, including their physical appearance, personality traits, and background.

The inspiration behind creating this dataset was to have a collection of data that explores the characteristics of adoptable dogs. While it may not be suitable for making predictions, it can be a valuable resource for practicing data visualization and working with categorical data.

The dataset features a range of characteristics, including the dog's name, age, sex, breed, and the date it was found. It also includes information on the dog's physical appearance, such as its color, coat type, and size. Additionally, the dataset provides information on the dog's personality, including whether it is neutered, housebroken, and its ability to get along with people, children, and other animals.
