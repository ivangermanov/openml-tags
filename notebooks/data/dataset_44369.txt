Name: Wine Seed Two Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Wine with seed equals two, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, arguments ncols max equals one hundred, arguments nclasses max equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the dataset. It first samples the classes uniformly, selecting the indices where one of the chosen classes is present. Then, it samples the columns uniformly if required. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, it stratifies the data accordingly and samples the rows. Finally, it returns a new dataset with the sampled data.

The dataset Wine has been subsampled with a seed of two, resulting in a dataset with two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The stratify parameter is set to false.

Features: acidity, acidity, acid, sugar, chlorides, sulfur dioxide, sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.
