QSAR-TID-100429 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100429. The dataset has forty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor two. The Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor two is a single protein, also known as Gpr one hundred nine, Gpr one hundred nine A, and Gpr one hundred nine B. It is a G-protein coupled receptor one hundred nine, and is involved in various biological processes, including apoptotic process, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and is available for further analysis and research.
