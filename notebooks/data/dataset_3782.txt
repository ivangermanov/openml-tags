This dataset, named QSAR-TID-100429, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor Two, with forty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty. The features represent Fingerprints of six bits, one thousand twenty-four molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings, and they were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, dated back to September two thousand fifteen, and it has forty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features. 

The description of the target is as follows: Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor Two is a single protein, also known as Gpr one hundred nine, Gpr one hundred nine a, Gpr one hundred nine b, G-protein coupled receptor one hundred nine, G-protein coupled receptor one hundred nine A, and other synonyms, which belongs to the species Mus musculus, classified under the group of one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, carboxylic acid receptor, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor.

The dataset is tagged with Economics, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, and study three.
