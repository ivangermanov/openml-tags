This binarized version of the original dataset converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

Features include various ozone levels. The binary classification system assigns a Positive label to instances with lower ozone levels and a Negative label to those with higher levels.
