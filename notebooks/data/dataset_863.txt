Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This binarization technique simplifies the original numeric target into a more straightforward two-class problem, potentially making it more suitable for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks.

The dataset includes several features, labeled as "oz" followed by numbers, suggesting they might represent different measurements or attributes. The final feature, "binary Class," likely represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process. This dataset could be valuable for researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems or those studying the effects of data transformation on model performance.
