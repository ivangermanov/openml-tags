Abstract:
The QSAR Biodegradation dataset contains values for forty-one molecular descriptors used to classify one thousand fifty-five chemicals into two classes: ready biodegradable and not ready biodegradable.

Data Set Information:
This dataset was built in the Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group at the University of Milan-Bicocca, Italy. The research leading to these results received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under the Marie Curie ITN Environmental Chemoinformatics project. The data were used to develop Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships models for studying the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules. Biodegradation experimental values of one thousand fifty-five chemicals were collected from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan webpage. Classification models were developed to discriminate ready and not ready biodegradable molecules using three different modeling methods: k Nearest Neighbors, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes forty-one molecular descriptors and one experimental class. These molecular descriptors include various physicochemical properties, topological indices, and electronic descriptors, which are commonly used in QSAR studies. The experimental class categorizes the chemicals into two categories: ready biodegradable and not ready biodegradable.
