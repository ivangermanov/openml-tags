The QSAR-TID-100956 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100956. This dataset has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100956. The data has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The preferred name of the target is G-Protein Coupled Receptor one hundred twenty, also known as Free Fatty Acid Receptor four. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under one point Membrane receptor, Family A G protein-coupled receptor, Small molecule receptor, Lipid-like ligand receptor.

The target is described as a Free Fatty Acid Receptor four, which is responsible for various biological processes, including negative regulation of cytokine production, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
