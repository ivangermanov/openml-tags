QSAR biodegradation Data Set

Abstract: This dataset contains values for forty-one attributes (molecular descriptors) used to classify one thousand and fifty-five chemicals into two classes: ready and not ready biodegradable.

Data Set Information: The QSAR biodegradation dataset was constructed by the Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group at the Università degli Studi Milano – Bicocca in Milano, Italy. The research leading to these results received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under a Marie Curie ITN Environmental Chemoinformatics (ECO) project grant agreement. The data have been utilized to develop Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) models for studying the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules. Biodegradation experimental values of over a thousand chemicals were collected from the webpage of the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan (NITE). Classification models were developed to discriminate between ready (three hundred and fifty-six) and not ready (six hundred and ninety-nine) biodegradable molecules using three different modeling methods: k Nearest Neighbors, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines.

Attribute Information: The dataset includes forty-one molecular descriptors and one experimental class. These descriptors encompass various chemical properties such as eigenvalues from Laplace and Burden matrices, frequencies of atomic pairs at different topological distances, counts of specific atom types, percentages of certain elements, and various chemical indices. The experimental class categorizes chemicals as either ready biodegradable (RB) or not ready biodegradable (NRB).

Relevant Papers: The primary reference for this dataset is a paper published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, which details the Quantitative Structure - Activity Relationship models for ready biodegradability of chemicals.

Features: The dataset includes forty-one features labeled V1 through V41, representing various molecular descriptors, and a Class feature indicating biodegradability.
