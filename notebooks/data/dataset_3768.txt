This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10323, is tagged with Government, MTLQSAR, Social Media, and study_3. It was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10323. There are ninety-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature called MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation because all bits are generated.

The dataset has many features, including MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

The compound being studied is Carboxypeptidase B two isoform A, also known as Carboxypeptidase B two, Carboxypeptidase U, CPB two, CPU, and pCPB. It is a single protein found in humans and belongs to the enzyme/protease/metallo protease/metallo protease MC clan/metallo protease M fourteen A subfamily classification.

Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, and other databases provide more information about this protein, including its function, process, and relationships.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, Carboxypeptidase B2, metallo protease, Gene Ontology.
