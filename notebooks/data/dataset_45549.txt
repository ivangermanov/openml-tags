This dataset comes from the Atlas Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge, a competition held in the field of chemistry and life science.

The data was downloaded from the Cern website, which also hosts the documentation of the data. Further information about the challenge can be found on Kaggle, the challenge website, and the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research competition proceedings.

The dataset contains various features, including event identification, mass measurements, particle properties, and weight labels. These features include event ID, mass measurements, particle transverse momentum, visible mass, particle production angle, total transverse momentum, and other relevant quantities.

Additionally, the dataset includes weights and labels for each event, as well as information on whether the event belongs to the Kaggle set and its corresponding weight.
