This is the dataset from the Atlas Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014. The data was downloaded from the Cern website, which also hosts the documentation of the data. Further information about the challenge can be found on Kaggle, the challenge website, and the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research competition proceedings.

The dataset features a range of variables, including the event ID, mass measurements, transverse momentum, and angular variables. It also includes variables related to the properties of jets, leptons, and missing transverse energy, as well as weights and labels for the events.

The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, with the training set including weights and labels for the events. The dataset is designed to challenge machine learning algorithms to distinguish between signal and background events in the search for the Higgs boson.
