MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase YES, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase YES. The dataset has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase YES is also known as Proto-Oncogene c-YES, Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Yes, and YES. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase superfamily, and it plays an important role in various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, cell survival, and cell migration.
