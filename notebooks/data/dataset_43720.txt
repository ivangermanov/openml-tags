Moneyball
Context
In the early two thousand era, the Oakland Athletics were facing a significant challenge. They were expected to compete with teams that had much deeper pockets, but they didn't have the luxury of a large budget. This is where statistics came to the rescue, providing a way for the team to level the playing field.

This dataset contains some of the information that was available during that time, and it can be used to better understand the methods that were employed to overcome the financial constraints. The dataset focuses on variables that were deemed crucial in scoring runs, such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage. These statistics were undervalued by most scouts at the time, which made them a goldmine for the Athletics.

The variables in the dataset include team, league, year, runs scored, runs allowed, wins, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, batting average, playoffs, rank in season, rank in playoffs, games played, opponent on-base percentage, and opponent slugging percentage.

The ability to uncover the truth hidden in a dataset is a vital skill in today's world. This is exactly what was achieved with this dataset, and it had a profound impact on the entire system of baseball recruitment. The goal was to make it to the playoffs, and with that in mind, it's essential to explore questions such as how a team makes the playoffs, how a team wins more games, and how a team scores more runs. These are simple questions with simple answers, but it's time to use the data to find the truth hidden in the numbers.
