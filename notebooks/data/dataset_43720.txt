In the early years of the twenty-first century, the Oakland Athletics faced a significant challenge. Despite being expected to compete with teams having much deeper pockets, they lacked sufficient financial resources. This is where statistics played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the game of baseball.

This data set contains crucial information that was available at that time, providing valuable insights into the methods employed. The key variables included in this data set are those that were heavily focused upon. It was determined that statistics like on-base percentage and slugging percentage were vital in scoring runs, yet they were undervalued by most scouts. This oversight presented a golden opportunity for the Athletics, as they could recruit these players without breaking the bank.

The variables included are:

Team

This data set is referenced in The Analytics Edge course, which explores the story of Moneyball. The data itself has been gathered from the comprehensive sports statistics resource, baseball-reference.com.

It is essential to possess the ability to uncover the truth hidden within a data set, which is precisely what was achieved. By defining their seasonal goal as making it to the playoffs, the Athletics posed several fundamental questions: What factors contribute to a team's success in reaching the playoffs? What elements lead to a team winning more games? How do teams manage to score more runs? These questions may seem straightforward, but they require careful analysis of the data to uncover the underlying truths.
