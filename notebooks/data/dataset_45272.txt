Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 9.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a discrete massive network.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes indicate a moderate level of connectivity.

The Munin dataset is an expert EMG assistant, designed to provide assistance in electromyography.

Features of this network include muscle activity, electromyography signals, and muscle denervation. Other features relate to muscle size, muscle pathology, and muscle regeneration.

The network also includes features related to nerve activity, nerve conduction, and nerve denervation. Additionally, there are features related to muscle contraction, muscle relaxation, and muscle fatigue.

The Munin dataset is a comprehensive network that captures various aspects of muscle and nerve physiology.

Keywords: electromyography, muscle activity, nerve conduction, muscle denervation, muscle regeneration.
