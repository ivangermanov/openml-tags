Subsampling of the dataset Guillermo with seed equal to three. Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Guillermo.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. The subsample is generated by uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The number of classes, columns, and rows to sample is specified by the user.

The function first samples the classes by selecting a specified number of unique classes from the original dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

Next, the function samples the columns by selecting a specified number of columns from the original dataset. It then uses these columns to subset the dataset.

Finally, the function samples the rows by selecting a specified number of rows from the dataset. It uses stratified sampling to ensure that the sample is representative of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset is then returned.
