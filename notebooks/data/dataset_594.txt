The Servo dataset has been converted into a binarized version, which transforms the numerical target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process involves calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This dataset is particularly useful for studies in Chemistry and Life Sciences, and has also been utilized in myth-busting and various research studies.

Features included in this dataset are Motor, Screw, Proportional Gain, and Velocity Gain, as well as the Binary Class.
