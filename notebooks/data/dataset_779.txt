The rewritten text:

This dataset has been binarized, which means it has converted the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. The dataset contains various features, including River, Country, Discharge, Runoff, Area, Density, Nitrate, Export, Deposition, and Nitrogen Precipitation. The binary classification system allows for easier analysis and comparison of the different instances within the dataset.

Keywords: dataset, binarization, nominal target feature, classification, chemistry, life science, nitrogen precipitation.
