Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset includes twenty-five features labeled as oz followed by numbers one through twenty-five, as well as a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target has been transformed into a binary classification task. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. This approach allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem, potentially offering new insights or analytical approaches.

The dataset's association with multiple studies suggests it has been utilized in various research contexts, possibly exploring different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, or statistical modeling. The "mythbusting" tag implies that the dataset may have been used to challenge or verify certain assumptions or claims in the field.
