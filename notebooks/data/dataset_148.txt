The Two D Planes dataset is a machine learning and statistics dataset, specifically designed for regression analysis, belonging to the OpenML-Reg nineteen collection and study one thirty.

This artificial dataset is described in a research paper, with variance one instead of two. The ten attributes are generated independently using specific probability distributions. The first attribute has a fifty percent chance of being minus one or one. The remaining nine attributes have a one-third probability of being minus one, zero, or one.

The target variable Y is obtained using a predefined rule based on the value of the first attribute. If the first attribute is one, then Y is calculated as three plus three times the second attribute, plus two times the third attribute, plus the fourth attribute, plus a random error term with a standard deviation of one. If the first attribute is minus one, then Y is calculated as minus three plus three times the fifth attribute, plus two times the sixth attribute, plus the seventh attribute, plus a random error term with a standard deviation of one.

This dataset consists of forty thousand seven hundred sixty-eight cases, each with eleven continuous attributes. It is part of a collection of regression datasets available online.
