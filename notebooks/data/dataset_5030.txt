Pathfinder Bayesian Network Sample One 

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository provides access to this network, which is categorized under discrete very large networks.

This network has a total of one hundred nine nodes and one hundred ninety five arcs, resulting in seventy two thousand seventy nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point eight two, while the average degree is around three point five eight. The maximum in-degree of any node is five.

The Pathfinder project aims to develop normative expert systems, focusing on the development of probabilistic models for decision support systems in medicine. This network represents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and health informatics.

Features include fault diagnosis and various other medical diagnostic categories.
