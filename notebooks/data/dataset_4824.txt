Elevators 
Tags: Earth Science, Machine Learning 

This dataset is part of the regression on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed in a similar manner to other datasets in this category. The original dataset is available online.

The Elevators dataset is derived from the task of controlling an F sixteen aircraft, although the target variable and attributes differ significantly from those found in the ailerons domain. In this particular case, the goal variable is closely tied to an action performed on the elevators of the aircraft. 

Several key features were identified and recorded during the process, including climb rate, speed, pitch, yaw, current roll, absolute roll, differential climb rate, differential roll rate, and differential climb acceleration. Additionally, several time-based variables were recorded, such as system activity times one through four, as well as their respective differences. Finally, the system activity metric itself was also included, along with its associated goal value.
