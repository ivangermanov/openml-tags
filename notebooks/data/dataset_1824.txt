QSAR-TID-103095 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103095. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It should be cited accordingly.

The drug target is a single protein known as Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase thirty-eight, also referred to as NDR one protein kinase or Nuclear Dbf-two-related kinase one. It belongs to the AGC protein kinase group and NDR family.

The target protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, protein modification process, negative regulation of MAP kinase activity, and postsynapse organization. It is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, and glutamatergic synapse.
