The QSAR-TID-102849 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102849. This dataset has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102849.

The preferred name for this target is Purinergic Receptor P two Y two. It also has synonyms such as ATP Receptor P two ru one, P two ry two, P two U one, and P two U Purinoceptor one.

This protein target belongs to the species Mus musculus, and its classification is one Membrane Receptor, Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor, Small Molecule Receptor, Nucleotide-Like Receptor.

It has component relationships with early endosome, plasma membrane, membrane, basolateral plasma membrane, apical plasma membrane, presynaptic active zone membrane, and glutamatergic synapse.

Its function includes G protein-coupled receptor activity, ATP binding, A one Adenosine Receptor binding, G protein-coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor activity, and G protein-coupled UTP receptor activity.
