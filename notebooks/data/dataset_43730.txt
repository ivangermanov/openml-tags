This work focuses on creating a dataset on Pandas Questions and Answers over Stack Overflow. Currently, there are numerous questions available on Stack Overflow that have been asked under the Pandas section. Many questions on Stack Overflow have poor quality or are duplicates of already answered questions. A new Stack Overflow user can ask a question that falls into any of these sections, such as low-quality, duplicate, spam, and so forth. Similarly, a new Stack Overflow user may not flag a question if it does not abide by Stack Overflow guidelines due to a lack of experience.

Therefore, users who have spent considerable time on Stack Overflow are the ones who provide high-quality answers, classify a question as a duplicate, can close them, downvote, and so on. We focus on expert users who have earned the Pandas Gold Tag on their profile, which means they have answered enough questions to at least evaluate an upcoming question's quality and decide whether to answer accordingly.

To create this dataset, we did not feel the need to perform web scraping to extract Stack Overflow data. Stack Overflow provides an online API where one can simply run SQL queries to obtain a downloadable CSV file.

With the given dataset, various tasks can be performed. Since all the questions and answers given by expert users have been extracted in the dataset, we can investigate what makes an answer acceptable when one of the associated tags is "Pandas". Additionally, we can explore reputation calculations.

The dataset features include post link, type, title, markdown, tags, created date, last edit date, edited by, score, favorites, views, answers, accepted status, community wiki status, and closed status.
