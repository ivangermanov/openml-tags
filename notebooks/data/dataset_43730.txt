This work focuses on creating a dataset on Pandas Questions and Answers over Stack Overflow. Presently, there are a large number of questions available on Stack Overflow that have been asked under the Pandas section. Many questions on Stack Overflow have bad quality or are duplicates of already answered questions. A new Stack Overflow user can ask a question that can fall into any of these sections, such as low quality, duplicate, spam, and so on. Similarly, a new Stack Overflow user might not flag a question if it does not abide by Stack Overflow guidelines due to a lack of experience. Therefore, users who have spent a long time on Stack Overflow are the ones who provide quality answers, classify a question as a duplicate, can close them, downvote, and so on.

We focus on a group of users who have earned the Pandas gold tag on their profile, which means they have answered enough questions to at least evaluate an upcoming question's quality and answer or not answer accordingly.

To create this dataset, I did not feel the need to perform any web scraping to extract Stack Overflow data. Stack Overflow provides an online API where one can simply run a SQL query to get a downloadable CSV file.

All thanks to the Stack Overflow data API. All copyrights to Stack Overflow and its network sites are licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.

So, what can be performed with the given dataset? Since all the questions and answers given by these users have been extracted in the dataset, a suggestion is to analyze what it takes for an answer to be accepted when one of the associated tags is "pandas". Reputation calculation can also be explored.

The dataset features include Post Link, Type, Title, Markdown, Tags, Created, Last Edit, Edited By, Score, Favorites, Views, Answers, Accepted, CW, and Closed.

Keywords: Pandas, Stack Overflow, dataset, questions, answers, gold tag, API, CSV, reputation calculation.
