This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase Alpha Four, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identification, fingerprint information, and other molecular properties.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset is related to economics and machine learning, specifically multi-task learning QSAR.

The target classification is an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, belonging to the CAMK protein kinase group and RSKb family.

It is involved in various biological processes including negative regulation of cytokine production, chromatin remodeling, and regulation of DNA-templated transcription.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, multi-task learning, economics, kinase, protein kinase, ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha four.
