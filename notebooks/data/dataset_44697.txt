Name: Satellite Seed Four Rows Two Thousand NC Classes Ten NC Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Satellite with seed equal to four, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters. If the number of classes is greater than nclasses max, it selects a subset of classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than ncols max, it uniformly samples columns. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, it stratifies the data and selects a subset of rows. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subset of data, categorical mask, and columns.
