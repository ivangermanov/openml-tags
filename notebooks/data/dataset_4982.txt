Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample 8.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository provides access to this network, which is characterized by its large number of nodes and arcs.

This network consists of seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, resulting in a substantial number of parameters, totaling fourteen fifty-three.

On average, each node has a Markov blanket size of four point five one, indicating a moderate level of complexity, while the average degree of three point five one suggests a relatively dense network structure.

Notably, some nodes have a maximum in-degree of six, implying a significant amount of influence from other variables.

The Hepar2 Bayesian Network is particularly useful for modeling complex medical relationships, particularly in the diagnosis of liver disorders.

Features of this network include an array of symptoms and medical conditions, such as anorexia, consciousness, and jaundice, as well as laboratory test results, including triglyceride levels and platelet counts.

Additionally, demographic information, such as age and sex, is also incorporated into the model.
