Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

The dataset contains various features related to banking and financial metrics. These features include geographical coordinates, population statistics, temperature measurements, and other relevant parameters. The final feature, binary class, represents the transformed target variable.

This binarized version of the dataset provides researchers and data scientists with a simplified classification problem, allowing for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques. The transformation from a continuous target variable to a binary outcome enables the exploration of threshold-based decision-making in financial contexts.

The original source and date of creation for this dataset are unknown. Researchers using this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately in their work, acknowledging its binarized nature and the modifications made to the original data.
