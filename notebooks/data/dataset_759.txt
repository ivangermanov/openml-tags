Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on Olympic performance metrics and related country-specific factors. It includes information about medal counts (gold, silver, bronze) for different countries, along with population statistics, number of athletes, and economic indicators such as GDP. The data has been processed to create a binary classification based on a threshold derived from the mean of a target feature. This binarization allows for a simplified analysis of Olympic success factors. The dataset incorporates both raw values and logarithmic transformations of certain variables, potentially to address skewed distributions or to linearize relationships between variables.
