The Kin Eight NM dataset is concerned with the forward kinematics of an eight-link robot arm. Among the existing variants of this dataset, we have used the Eight NM variant, which is known to be highly nonlinear and moderately noisy. The original source of this dataset is the DELVE repository of data. It is also part of a collection of regression datasets.

This dataset has several characteristics that make it useful for machine learning and mathematical modeling. It contains eight thousand one hundred ninety-two cases, each described by nine attributes. These attributes are all continuous, with no nominal attributes present.

The features of this dataset include angles and positions of the robot arm links, which are essential for predicting its movement and behavior. Understanding these relationships is crucial for developing accurate models of robot motion.
