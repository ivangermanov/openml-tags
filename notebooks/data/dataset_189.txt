This dataset is concerned with the forward kinematics of an link robot arm. Among the existing variants of this dataset, the variant nm has been used, which is known to be highly non-linear and moderately noisy. The original source of this data comes from the DELVE repository. It is part of a collection of regression datasets available online.

The dataset characteristics include numerous cases and attributes, all of which are continuous with no nominal attributes. The features of the dataset represent various theta values, presumably corresponding to different joint angles or positions of the robot arm, along with a target variable y.

This kinematic dataset likely serves as a benchmark for machine learning algorithms, particularly in the domain of robotic control and forward kinematics prediction. The non-linear and noisy nature of the data presents a challenging task for regression models, making it valuable for testing and comparing different approaches in robotics and machine learning research.
