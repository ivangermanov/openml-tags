QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Purinergic receptor PY, also known as GPR, G protein coupled receptor, KIAA, PRY, and PY. This receptor is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the small molecule receptor and nucleotide like receptor subfamilies within the purine receptor classification.

The PY purinoceptor is part of the PY receptor protein family. It is expressed in the plasma membrane and has G protein coupled receptor activity, including G protein coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor activity and G protein coupled UDP receptor activity. The receptor is involved in signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, and G protein coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor signaling pathways.

This target is associated with various databases and resources, including ExpressionAtlas, GO Component, GO Function, GO Process, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. These resources provide additional information on the receptor's structure, function, and interactions.

The dataset aims to facilitate quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies for this important drug target, potentially aiding in the discovery and development of new therapeutic compounds targeting the PY receptor.
