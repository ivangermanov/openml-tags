Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample One.

The Alarm Bayesian network repository reference can be found online.

This network consists of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in five hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, while the average degree is around two point four nine. The maximum in-degree is four.

This network is a case study featuring two probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. It showcases the Alarm monitoring system, which is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between various medical parameters.

Some of the key features of this network include Disconnect, Insufficient Anesthesia, Pulmonary Artery Pressure, History, Arterial Carbon Dioxide, Error Caused by Autoregulation, Heart Rate Blood Pressure, Press, Fraction of Inspired Oxygen, Blood Pressure, Ventilator Machine, Ventilator Tube, Catecholamine, Cardiac Output, Intubation, Error Low Output, Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure, Minimum Volume Set, Total Peripheral Resistance, Central Venous Pressure, Ventilator Lung, Anaphylaxis, Pulse Saturation, Minimum Volume, Expected Carbon Dioxide, Heart Rate Saturation, Left Ventricular Failure, Hypovolemia, Heart Rate Electrocardiogram, Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume, Arterial Oxygen Saturation, Pulmonary Embolus, Heart Rate, Ventilator Alveolar, Stroke Volume, Kinked Tube, and Shunt.
