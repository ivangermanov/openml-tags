Planning-Relax Dataset
Tags: mf_less_than, study, study, study

The Planning-Relax Dataset is designed for the automatic classification of EEG signals. It focuses on distinguishing between two mental states: planning (during imagination of motor acts) and relaxation. This univariate dataset contains instances with real-valued attributes and is associated with classification tasks. There are no missing values in the dataset.

The dataset comprises EEG recordings collected from a healthy right-handed subject over multiple sessions. The data was recorded using a Medelec Profile Digital EEG machine with specific settings for signal processing. Eight EEG electrodes were placed according to the international standard system of electrode placement, including bipolar and unipolar recordings. Reference electrodes were positioned on the ears, with a ground electrode on the forehead. Electrooculogram (EOG) signals were also recorded to detect and eliminate eye movement artifacts.

During data collection, the subject was instructed to lie down comfortably in a relaxed position with closed eyes, minimizing eye movements. The experiment involved recording EEG data for both relaxed states and movement imagery states. For the latter, the subject was cued with an audio beep to mentally plan lifting their right hand thumb without performing any actual movement. The experiment consisted of multiple trials for each state, with each trial lasting five seconds.

The dataset utilizes wavelet packet analysis for feature extraction, which allows for signal decomposition with equal frequency bandwidth at each level. This approach was chosen to identify the most discriminating frequency band (seven to thirteen Hz) in conjunction with the Daubechies wavelet. The resulting features represent wavelet coefficients obtained from the reconstructed signal at a specific node of decomposition.

This dataset is valuable for researchers studying EEG signal classification, particularly in the context of motor imagery and relaxation states. It provides a foundation for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms for brain-computer interfaces and neurological state detection.
