QSAR-TID-11637 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11637. The dataset has ninety-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the protein kinase N1, which is a single protein target. The protein kinase N1 is also known as PAK1, PAK-1, PKN, PKN1, PRK1, and has several synonyms. It is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, cell growth, and cell differentiation.

The dataset provides information about the expression of protein kinase N1 in different tissues and cells, including its subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications. It also includes data on the enzyme activity, substrate specificity, and inhibitor binding of protein kinase N1.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of inhibitors and activators of protein kinase N1, as well as for those studying the role of this enzyme in various diseases and disorders.
