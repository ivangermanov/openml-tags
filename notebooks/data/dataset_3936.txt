Acknowledgments

This dataset was scraped from http://house.speakingsame.com/, comprising data from various Perth suburbs, resulting in a comprehensive collection of information.

Content

I firmly believe that the columns chosen to represent this dataset are the most crucial in predicting house prices. A preliminary analysis I conducted revealed a significant correlation between each of these columns and the response variable, namely the price. 

Data Obtained from Other Sources 

Longitude and latitude data were obtained from data.gov.au, ensuring accuracy and reliability. School ranking data was sourced from Better Education, providing valuable insights into the educational landscape. The nearest schools to each address selected in this dataset are schools that offer an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) program, which is a scoring system used to assess a student's cumulative academic results and is employed for university admissions in Australia. Consequently, schools that do not provide an ATAR program, such as primary schools, vocational schools, and special needs schools, are not considered in determining the nearest school. It is worth noting that under the Nearest School Rank column, there are some missing values, as certain schools are unranked according to this criterion by Better Education.
