Experiment data was obtained by running random configurations of a Support Vector Machine through Machine Learning R on a diverse range of Classification Tasks from OpenML. These tasks were carefully selected to represent a broad spectrum of challenges and opportunities in machine learning.

The data includes information about each task, including the Task ID and the corresponding Dataset. Additionally, details about the Learner used, specifically the type of Support Vector Machine employed, are also included.

Performance metrics for each configuration are also recorded, including the Mean Misclassification Error and Log Loss. Furthermore, the time taken for training and prediction are noted, providing valuable insights into the computational efficiency of each approach.

A range of hyperparameters were tuned for each Support Vector Machine, including the Kernel function used, the Cost parameter, Gamma value, Tolerance level, and whether Shrinking was enabled. The number of imputed values selected using Conditional Parameter Optimization is also documented.

Finally, the Fitted model and Degree of the polynomial kernel are included, providing a comprehensive understanding of each configuration.
