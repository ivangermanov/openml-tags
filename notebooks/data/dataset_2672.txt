**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex EUR/NOK currency pair, obtained from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a single candlestick of one minute duration. The dataset covers a specific time period, excluding weekends when the Forex market is closed.

The timestamp feature is based on the Europe/Amsterdam time zone. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean close price of the subsequent minute, relative to the mean close price of the current minute.
