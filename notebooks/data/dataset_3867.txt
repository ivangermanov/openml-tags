QSAR-TID-11562 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11562. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the drug target TID: 11562. It can be used to develop predictive models of compound activity and to identify potential lead compounds for further optimization.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The target is a single protein, specifically a membrane receptor, and is classified as a family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The dataset also contains information about the expression of the target, including its subcellular localization and biological processes it is involved in. The target is expressed in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and postsynapse, and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and metabolic process regulation.
