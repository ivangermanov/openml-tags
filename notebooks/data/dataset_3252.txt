QSAR-TID-100858 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred and eight thousand five hundred and fifty-eight, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred and twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand and fifteen. It is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery.

The dataset contains a range of features that are used to describe the molecular structure and properties of the compounds. These features are used to build predictive models that can identify potential drug candidates and optimize their activity.

The dataset is a result of a comprehensive study that aimed to develop a robust QSAR model for the drug target TID: one hundred and eight thousand five hundred and fifty-eight. The study involved the collection and analysis of a large dataset of compounds with known activity values.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It provides a comprehensive set of features and activity values that can be used to build predictive models and identify potential drug candidates.
