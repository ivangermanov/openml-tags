This dataset, named QSAR-TID-100858, is tagged with Images, Life Science, and MTLQSAR, and belongs to the study three category. It was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 100858. There are twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset includes molecule identifiers, median pxc fifty, and various fingerprint features. 

Keywords: QSAR data, molecular fingerprints, drug target, MetaQSAR project.
