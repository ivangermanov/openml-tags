The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used for evaluating classification methodologies. It represents one of the earliest datasets utilized in the literature on classification methods and is widely employed in statistics and machine learning.

Each instance in the dataset corresponds to a specific plant. The dataset comprises three classes, each containing fifty instances, where each class refers to a distinct type of iris plant. Notably, one class is linearly separable from the other two, whereas the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

The predicted attribute in this dataset is the class of the iris plant. This domain is remarkably simple, making it an ideal choice for testing and evaluating various classification algorithms.

It is essential to note that the dataset has undergone revisions since its initial publication. Specifically, corrections have been made to certain samples to ensure accuracy.

This dataset does not contain any missing values, which makes it suitable for analysis and modeling purposes.

Keywords: Iris dataset, classification methodologies, statistics, machine learning, plants, taxonomy, classification algorithms.
