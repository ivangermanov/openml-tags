The MLL dataset is a machine learning dataset related to microarray analysis and social media. It is characterized by its unique gene expression profile that distinguishes a specific type of leukemia.

This dataset has been widely used in research studies to identify genetic markers associated with this particular form of cancer. The dataset consists of a large number of features, including genes and their corresponding expressions.

Some examples of these features include Murine Interleukin Two, Murine Interleukin Ten, Murine Interleukin Four, Fas Antigen, Human Alu Sequence, and many others.

The MLL dataset has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of cancer biology and has paved the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
