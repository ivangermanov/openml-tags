Name: Click Prediction Small

Tags: Modified Version of Subsampled Dataset

This dataset is a modified version of a subsampled dataset, carefully curated to provide a more refined and efficient data analysis experience. To achieve this, duplicate rows were meticulously dropped to eliminate redundancy and ensure data consistency. Furthermore, columns with an excessively high ratio of unique values were deliberately dropped to prevent data noise and improve model performance.

Additionally, certain columns were cast to factor to enable more effective data manipulation and analysis. The resulting dataset features a range of variables, including click, impression, URL hash, ad identifier, advertiser identifier, depth, position, keyword identifier, and description identifier.

Keywords: click prediction, subsampled dataset, data refinement, duplicate removal, data consistency, model performance.
