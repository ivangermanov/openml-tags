Miami Housing 2016 
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

This dataset is part of the classification on numerical features benchmark and was transformed in the same way as the other datasets in this benchmark. 

The Miami Housing 2016 dataset contains information on single-family homes sold in Miami in 2016. In addition to publicly available information, this dataset includes distance variables, aviation noise, as well as latitude and longitude. 

The dataset consists of several columns, including a unique identifier for each property, the sale price, land area, floor area, value of special features, distance to the nearest rail line, distance to the ocean, distance to the nearest body of water, distance to the Miami central business district, distance to the nearest subcenter, distance to the nearest highway, age of the structure, a dummy variable indicating whether airplane noise exceeds an acceptable level, quality of the structure, and the month in which the sale took place. 

A typical model would attempt to predict the logarithm of the sale price based on all variables except the unique parcel number. 

Features include Latitude, Longitude, Land Square Footage, Total Living Area, Value of Special Features, Rail Distance, Ocean Distance, Water Distance, Central Business District Distance, Subcenter Distance, Highway Distance, Age, Month Sold, and Sale Price.
