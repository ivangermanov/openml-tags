QSAR-TID-11602 Tags: Chemistry, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11602, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
