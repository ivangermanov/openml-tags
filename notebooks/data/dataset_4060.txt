QSAR-TID-11602 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11602. The dataset has fifty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11602. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the drug target TID: 11602, which is a single protein target.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The preferred name of the drug target is Calpain one, and it is also known as Calcium-activated neutral proteinase one, Calpain-one catalytic subunit, and Calpain-one large subunit.

The dataset also contains information about the expression of the drug target, including its subcellular localization, molecular function, and biological process. The drug target is localized in the cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and membrane, and it has molecular functions such as calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.
