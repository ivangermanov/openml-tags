QSAR-TID-12971 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12971. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to Cytochrome P450 17A1, a protein target that plays a crucial role in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including organic acid metabolic process, lipid metabolic process, and steroid biosynthetic process.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and machine learning applications, such as predicting the activity of compounds on Cytochrome P450 17A1.
