The original dataset, Depression, is involved in the analysis of depression. The data consists of a study about the life conditions of people who live in rural zones. Due to the lack of explanation for all the columns, some of them were deleted or ignored. The final features or columns that were retained are: Content, Survey ID, City ID, Sex, Age, Marital Status, Number of Children, Education Level, Total Family Members, Gained Assets, Durable Assets, Saved Assets, Living Expenses, Other Expenses, Income from Salary, Income from Own Farm, Income from Business, Income from No Business, Income from Agriculture, Farm Expenses, Primary Labor, Lasting Investment, and No Lasting Investment. The target class is Depression, which is a binary variable where Zero indicates No Depression and One indicates Depression.

The main objective is to show statistical analysis and some data mining techniques. The dataset has a total of twenty-three columns or dimensions.
