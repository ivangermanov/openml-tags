The Original Dataset is involved in the analysis of Depression, specifically focusing on the life conditions of individuals residing in rural areas.

The dataset consisted of various columns, however, due to the lack of explanation, certain columns were deleted or ignored. The remaining features include Content, Survey Identification, City Identification, Sex, Age, Marital Status, Number of Children, Education Level, Total Family Members, Gained Assets, Durable Assets, Saved Assets, Living Expenses, Other Expenses, Income Salary, Income from Own Farm, Income from Business, Income from No Business, Income from Agriculture, Farm Expenses, Primary Labor, Lasting Investment, and No Lasting Investment.

The primary objective is to conduct statistical analysis and apply data mining techniques. The dataset comprises twenty-three columns and a substantial number of rows.

The main goal is to identify the correlation between these factors and Depression, which is represented as a binary target class where zero indicates no Depression and one indicates Depression.
