The NYC Taxi Green December 2016 dataset is a collection of trip record data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. This dataset includes trips of the green line in December 2016 and was downloaded on a specific date. For a detailed description of all variables in the dataset, please refer to the Taxi and Limousine Commission's homepage.

The target variable chosen for this dataset is the tip amount. The total amount variable is ignored by default to prevent deterministic prediction. The date variables, including pickup and drop-off dates and times, could be used to compute additional time features. However, in this version, only trips with a payment type of credit card are included, as tips are not included for most other payment types.

Additionally, the variables trip distance and fare amount were removed to increase the importance of the categorical features pickup location ID and drop-off location ID. The remaining features include vendor ID, store and forward flag, rate code ID, pickup location ID, drop-off location ID, passenger count, extra, MTA tax, tip amount, tolls amount, improvement surcharge, trip type, pickup date, pickup hour, pickup minute, drop-off date, drop-off hour, and drop-off minute.
