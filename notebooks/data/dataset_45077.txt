The QSAR Biodegradation dataset was built in the Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group. The research leading to these results received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under the Marie Curie ITN Environmental Chemoinformatics project. The data were used to develop Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships models for the study of the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules. Biodegradation experimental values of chemicals were collected from the webpage of the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan. Classification models were developed in order to discriminate ready and not ready biodegradable molecules by means of three different modeling methods: k Nearest Neighbors, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines. Details on attributes selected in each model can be found in the reference. The models were developed to study the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules, with the goal of predicting whether a molecule is ready or not ready to biodegrade.
