QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target protein is the Neurokinin receptor, also known as NKR, NK receptor, SPR, and Substance P receptor. It is classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein coupled receptor category, specifically a peptide receptor and short peptide receptor within the neurokinin receptor subfamily. The protein is found in humans and is located in cellular components including the plasma membrane, cell surface, dendrites, sperm flagellum, cell body, and sperm head.

The Neurokinin receptor has several molecular functions, including G protein coupled receptor activity, tachykinin receptor activity, protein binding, and substance P receptor activity. It is involved in numerous biological processes such as aggressive behavior, leukocyte migration, inflammatory response, signal transduction, learning and memory, blood pressure regulation, and responses to various stimuli including hormones, organic compounds, and pain.

Several small molecule antagonists targeting this receptor have been developed, including netupitant, vofopitant, tradipitant, aprepitant, and elinzanetant. These compounds are in various phases of drug development, with some already approved for clinical use.

The receptor plays roles in multiple signaling pathways, including G protein coupled receptor signaling, tachykinin receptor signaling, and regulation of smooth muscle contraction. It is also involved in processes like sperm motility, eating behavior, and vascular permeability regulation.
