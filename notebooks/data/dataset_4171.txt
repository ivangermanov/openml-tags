This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of a large number of diamonds. It is a great dataset for beginners who are learning to work with data analysis and visualization because it provides a wealth of information about these precious stones.

The dataset includes a range of variables related to the characteristics of each diamond, including its price in United States dollars. The carat weight of each diamond is also included, which ranges from very small to quite large. In addition, the dataset includes information about the quality of the cut of each diamond, which can be classified as Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, or Ideal. 

Another important variable in the dataset is the color of each diamond, which is graded on a scale from J, which is the worst, to D, which is the best. The clarity of each diamond is also measured, with grades ranging from I1, which is the worst, to IF, which is the best. 

In terms of physical dimensions, the dataset includes the length, width, and depth of each diamond in millimeters. It also includes a calculated variable called depth percentage, which represents the total depth percentage of each diamond. Finally, the dataset includes a variable called table, which refers to the width of the top of each diamond relative to its widest point.
