QSAR-TID-10674 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10674. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systèmes biovia.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero six seven four. 

The dataset has five hundred eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty. The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systèmes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to health and medicine, particularly qsar tid one zero six seven four, mtlqsar, and study three. It is a part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset provides information about beta secretase two, which is a single protein preferred name. It has synonyms such as aeplc alp fifty-six asp one asp twenty-one, and others. The dataset also includes information about the organism, species group, protein target classification, and description relationship accession.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about go component, go function, go process, wikipedia, cansar-target, guide to pharmacology, intact, pharmgkb, pharos, tchem uniprot, interpro, pfam, and pdb e. 

Keywords: QSAR, TID 10674, MetaQSAR, health, medicine, beta secretase, protein target classification, go component, go function, go process.
