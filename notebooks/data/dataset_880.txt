Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset represents a binarized adaptation of an original dataset, focusing on mythbusting and study-related topics. The conversion process involves transforming a numeric target feature into a binary classification system. This is achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The resulting dataset maintains the original structure while providing a simplified binary classification framework for analysis and study purposes.
