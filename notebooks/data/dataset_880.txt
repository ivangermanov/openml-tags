This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The features included in this dataset are Label and Binary Class.
