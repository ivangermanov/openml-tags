Title: USP zero five: Software Effort Estimation at Project, Feature, and Requirement Levels

Source Information: Computer Science Department, University of Calgary, Canada

Past Usage: This data set has been used in various studies, including a flexible method for effort estimation by analogy and a comparative study of attribute weighting heuristics for effort estimation by analogy.

Relevant Information: This data set was split into USP zero five RQ and USP zero five FT for requirements and features, respectively. It was collected from university student projects, and the detailed description of the whole data set can be found in the referenced study.

Number of Instances: Two hundred three instances, comprising six projects, one hundred twenty-one requirements, and seventy-six features.

Number of Attributes: Seventeen attributes, including ID, Object Type, Effort, and other relevant characteristics.

Attribute Information: 

* ID represents a unique three-digit object identifier.
* Object Type indicates whether the instance is a project, feature, or requirement.
* Effort represents the actual effort in hours expended on tasks related to implementing the object by all participating individuals.
* Functionality Percentage describes the percentage of functionality of features or requirements, categorized into seven types: internal process, data entry/modification/deletion, output form/screen, data query from database/file, printing, report, and other.
* Internal Calculation Complexity measures the complexity of internal calculation, ranging from very low to very high.
* Data File represents the number of data files/database tables accessed, which is a positive integer value.
* Data Entry and Data Output items represent the number of data entry and output items, respectively, which are also positive integer values.
* Unadjusted Function Point Count measures the unadjusted function point count, which is a positive integer value.
* Language Used indicates the programming language employed, such as C++, Java, or Visual Basic.
* Development Tools and Platforms describe the development tools and platforms utilized, such as VJ++, VB, or Delphi.
* Language and Tool Experience Level represents the range of months of experience with the language and tool, ranging from a minimum of two months to a maximum of five months.
* Applications Experience Level measures the applications experience level, categorized into five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high.
* Team Size represents the team size for implementing the object, ranging from a minimum of two individuals to a maximum of five individuals.
* Database Systems describe the database systems employed, such as Oracle, Access, or SQL Server.
* Methodology indicates the methodology used, such as object-oriented, structured analysis, or rapid application development.
* Application/System Architecture categorizes the application/system architecture into four types: browser/server, client/server, browser/client/server, or centered architecture.

Missing Attribute Values: Eighty-three missing attribute values exist within the data set.

Keywords: software engineering, effort estimation, project management, feature extraction, requirement analysis, data mining.
