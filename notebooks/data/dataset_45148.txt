Insurance Bayesian Network. Sample Six.

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, which can be accessed at the provided URL. The network consists of twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with a total of one thousand and eight parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point one nine, and the average degree is approximately three point eight five. The maximum in-degree is three.

The Insurance Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium network that represents a complex system. It is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing uncertain relationships between variables.

The network features a range of variables, including driving history, driving skill, age, ruggedness of the automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft devices, driving quality, risk aversion, good student discounts, other cars, make and model, accidents, socioeconomic status, home base, property cost, car value, anti-lock brakes, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft, airbags, medical costs, senior training, and cushioning.
