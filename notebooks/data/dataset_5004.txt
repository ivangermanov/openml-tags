Andes Bayesian Network. Sample Eight.

The Andes Bayesian network is a repository of discrete very large networks, specifically designed for machine learning and human activities modeling. This network has two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, resulting in one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is five point six one, while the average degree is three point zero three, with a maximum in-degree of six.

This network is particularly useful for modeling complex systems and relationships between variables. It can be used to identify patterns and dependencies within large datasets, making it an essential tool for data analysts and researchers.

Features of this network include Goal Setting, Problem Solving, Knowledge Representation, and Student Modeling, among others. These features enable the network to capture nuanced relationships between variables, providing insights into human behavior and decision-making processes.
