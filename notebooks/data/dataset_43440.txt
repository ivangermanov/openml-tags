The Forest Fire Area dataset contains information about five hundred seventeen fires that occurred in the Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal. For each fire incident, the data includes details about the day of the week and the month it took place, along with the geographical coordinates of the location and the total area affected by the fire. Additionally, various meteorological factors are also recorded, including rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

This dataset is used to train a machine learning model that predicts the total area burned based on these spatial, temporal, and weather-related variables. By analyzing these factors, the model aims to identify patterns and relationships that can help forecast the severity of forest fires.

The Forest Fire Area dataset has been widely cited and has contributed significantly to research in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
