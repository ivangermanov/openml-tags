Forest Fire Area Tags: Content

The dataset contains fires from the Montesinho natural park in Portugal. For each incident, the day of the week, month, coordinates, and the area burned are recorded, as well as several meteorological data such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The workflow reads the data and trains a regression model based on the spatial, temporal, and weather variables to predict the area burned.
