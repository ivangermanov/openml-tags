The Semeion Handwritten Digit Data Set is a collection of one thousand five hundred ninety-three handwritten digits from approximately eighty individuals who were asked to write each digit from zero to nine twice, once normally and once quickly. The dataset was created by scanning these handwritten digits and documenting them.

The dataset was created by Tactile Srl, Brescia, Italy, and donated in nineteen ninety-four to the Semeion Research Center of Sciences of Communication, Rome, Italy, for machine learning research.

A total of one thousand five hundred ninety-three handwritten digits from around eighty persons were scanned, stretched in a rectangular box sixteen by sixteen in a grayscale of two hundred fifty-six values. Then each pixel of each image was scaled into a Boolean value using a fixed threshold. 

This dataset consists of one thousand five hundred ninety-three records and two hundred fifty-six attributes. Each record represents a handwritten digit, originally scanned with a resolution of two hundred fifty-six grayscale. Each pixel of the each original scanned image was first stretched, and after scaled between zero and one.

The best validation protocol for this dataset seems to be a five-by-two cross-validation, with fifty percent tune and completely blind fifty percent validation.
