The QSAR-TID-30041 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand forty-one. This dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID three thousand forty-one. The features in this dataset represent fingerprints that were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program.

The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features are fingerprints that do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset is suitable for machine learning and earth science applications.

The dataset is related to the serine threonine protein kinase thirty-six, also known as fused homolog serine threonine protein kinase thirty-six. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including epithelial cilium movement, protein phosphorylation, and brain development.
