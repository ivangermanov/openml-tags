This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous others.

Scraped data includes information about Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M one, also known as Single Protein. It has preferred name Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M one, and synonyms such as Muscarinic Receptor M one. It belongs to species group Bos Taurus, and its protein target classification is One Point Membrane Receptor Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor Small Molecule Receptor Family A GPCR Monoamine Receptor Acetylcholine Receptor.

Description relationship accession includes Muscarinic Receptor M one Single Protein. Rows per page include fifty-one minus one of one go component, which includes GO terms for plasma membrane, postsynaptic membrane, and synaptic membrane.

Go function includes two GO terms, one for G Protein-Coupled Receptor Activity and another for G Protein-Coupled Acetylcholine Receptor Activity.
