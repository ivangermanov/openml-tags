Background

The popular television show Shark Tank, which originated in Japan in two thousand nine, has become a household name in the United States. The show provides a platform for entrepreneurs across the country to present their innovative ideas to a panel of billionaire investors.

For this comprehensive study, it was intriguing to examine the performance of companies featured on the show, particularly those that secured deals with at least one investor. By analyzing the data, we aimed to identify trends and patterns among these successful companies.

Data
