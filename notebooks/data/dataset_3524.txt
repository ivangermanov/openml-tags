This dataset contains Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: One Zero Two Seven Three Four, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (FCFP) six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE ChEMBL ID and numerous FCFP six one zero two four fingerprints. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project. 

It is related to the field of economics and machine learning QSAR.
