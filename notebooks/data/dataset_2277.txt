This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Ecdysone Receptor, and it has eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, tagged as Demographics, MTLQSAR, and study three.

The ecdysone receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as twenty hydroxy ecdysone receptor, ecdysone receptor, ecdysteroid receptor, EcR, and EcRH. It is found in the species Choristoneura fumiferana, and is classified as a transcription factor, nuclear receptor, nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one, nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group H, and nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group H member one.

The ecdysone receptor is involved in many biological processes, including DNA templated transcription, regulation of DNA templated transcription, and ecdysone receptor mediated signaling pathway. It has many molecular functions, including DNA binding, DNA binding transcription factor activity, nuclear receptor activity, zinc ion binding, ecdysone binding, sequence specific DNA binding, and metal ion binding.
