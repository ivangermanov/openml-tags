Amazon Ratings for Beauty Products

Tags: Context, Amazon.com, Beauty Products

Amazon.com is one of the largest electronic commerce and cloud computing companies in the world. Just a few interesting facts about Amazon: when their website went down for a short period of time, they lost a significant amount of money. They hold the patent on One-Click buying and license it to other companies, including Apple. Their fulfillment centers are massive, with one of their centers covering an area of over a million square feet.

This dataset is related to over two million customer reviews and ratings of beauty-related products sold on their website. It contains the unique User Identification, the product identification code, ratings based on customer satisfaction, and the timestamp of the rating. 

Acknowledgments: This dataset is a part of a larger dataset that contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including reviews, product metadata, and links. For the complete dataset, please check out the Amazon Product Data.
