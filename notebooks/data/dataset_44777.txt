Name: sf-police-incidents Seed Four with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset sf-police-incidents

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean parameter. It uses a random number generator to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable and selects a specified number of classes based on their frequency. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, and if the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it stratifies the data and selects a subset using train test split.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
