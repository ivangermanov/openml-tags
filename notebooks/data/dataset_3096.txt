QSAR-TID-52 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Alpha-2A Adrenergic Receptor.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has 877 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

Scraped Data:

The Alpha-2A Adrenergic Receptor is a single protein, also known as ADRA2A, ADRA2R, ADRAR, Alpha-2A Adrenergic Receptor, and Alpha-2A Adrenoceptor.

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor/family A G protein-coupled receptor/small molecule receptor family A GPCR/monoamine receptor/adrenergic receptor.

Description:
The Alpha-2A Adrenergic Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of cytokine production, DNA replication, regulation of smooth muscle contraction, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

It is also involved in adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, Ras protein signal transduction, Rho protein signal transduction, female pregnancy, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, and negative regulation of norepinephrine secretion.

Additionally, it plays a role in regulation of vasoconstriction, actin cytoskeleton organization, platelet activation, positive regulation of cell migration, activation of protein kinase activity, activation of protein kinase B activity, negative regulation of epinephrine secretion, and cellular response to hormone stimulus.
