Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 3.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has been designed to model complex relationships between various variables related to astronomy, earth science, and other fields.

The Munin network consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, which are used to represent conditional dependencies between variables. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes provide insights into the structure of the network.

The network has been designed to be highly interconnected, with many nodes having multiple parents and children. This allows for the modeling of complex relationships between variables.

The Munin network has a wide range of applications, including expert systems, electromyography, and computer-aided diagnosis.

Features of the network include muscle activity, electromyographic signals, nerve conduction velocities, and other physiological and anatomical variables.
