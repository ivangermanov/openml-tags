This dataset contains information on NASA software projects for cost estimation purposes. It includes data from various NASA centers spanning multiple years. The COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) software cost model is used, which measures effort in calendar months of 152 hours, including both development and management time.

The COCOMO model assumes that effort grows more than linearly with software size, following the formula: months = a * KSLOC^b * c, where 'a' and 'b' are domain-specific parameters, 'KSLOC' is thousand source lines of code, and 'c' is the product of several effort multipliers.

Effort multipliers include factors such as analyst capability, programmer capability, application experience, use of modern programming practices, software tools, virtual machine experience, language experience, schedule constraints, memory constraints, database size, time constraints, turnaround time, machine volatility, process complexity, and required software reliability.

The dataset contains 93 instances with 24 attributes, including 15 standard COCOMO-I discrete attributes ranging from Very Low to Extra High, 7 project descriptors, a lines of code measure, and the actual effort in person months as the goal field.

The COCOMO model has evolved from COCOMO I to COCOMO II, with changes in how the exponent and effort multipliers are calculated. COCOMO II introduced scale factors and modified some of the effort multipliers.

The effectiveness of effort predictors can be measured using metrics such as MMRE (Mean Magnitude of Relative Error) and PRED(N) (Percentage of Predictions within N% of actual values). These metrics help assess the accuracy of cost estimation models.

The dataset has no missing attributes and includes a distribution of class values showing the range of development months for the projects.

This data is part of the PROMISE Software Engineering Repository, made available to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and improvable predictive models of software engineering. Users of this data are encouraged to follow the acknowledgment guidelines posted on the PROMISE repository web page.
