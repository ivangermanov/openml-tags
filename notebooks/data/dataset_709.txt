Fri C Two is a binarized regression problem dataset in the field of Chemistry, which involves machine learning techniques to analyze chemical compounds. This dataset is part of various studies, including Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, and Study Forty-One. 

The dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset consists of fifty features, although they are not easily interpretable due to their notation. The resulting binary class feature is the primary focus of this dataset.
