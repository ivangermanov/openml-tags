Dataset Information

This dataset contains examples of poker hands consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of fifty-two cards. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), resulting in a total of ten predictive attributes. There is one Class attribute that describes the "Poker Hand". The order of cards is important, which is why there are many possible Royal Flush hands compared to one for each suit.

Additional Information

Each record represents a hand of five playing cards. The suits are represented as ordinal values from one to four, corresponding to Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs. The ranks are represented numerically from one to thirteen, representing Ace, two, three, and so on up to Queen and King.

The Class attribute is ordinal, ranging from zero to nine, representing different poker hands:

- Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand
- One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards
- Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards
- Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards
- Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps
- Flush; five cards with the same suit
- Full house; pair plus different rank three of a kind
- Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards
- Straight flush; straight plus flush
- Royal flush; Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten plus flush

This dataset does not contain any missing values. The original source of this dataset is unknown, but it appears to be a normalized version of a poker hand dataset.
