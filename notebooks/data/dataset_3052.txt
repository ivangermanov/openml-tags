QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Platelet derived growth factor receptor beta, also known as Beta platelet derived growth factor receptor, Beta type platelet derived growth factor receptor, CD antigen like family member B, and CD antigen CD. This protein is found in Mus musculus and is classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase PDGFR family.

The protein is involved in various cellular processes and pathways, including blood vessel development, kidney development, tissue homeostasis, glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic process, protein phosphorylation, chemotaxis, signal transduction, cell population proliferation, cell migration, and many more. It is found in multiple cellular components such as ruffles, nucleus, cytoplasm, lysosome, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and cell surface.

The protein has numerous molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, platelet derived growth factor receptor activity, ATP binding, and various binding activities with other proteins and molecules.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is sourced from ChEMBL. It provides valuable information for studying the activity of compounds on the Platelet derived growth factor receptor beta, which plays crucial roles in various biological processes and could be a potential target for drug development.
