The Sulfur dataset is used in the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. The sulfur recovery unit removes environmental pollutants from acid gas streams before they are released into the atmosphere, and furthermore, elemental sulfur is recovered as a valuable by-product. The dataset consists of five input variables, which are gas and air flows, and two output variables to predict, which are Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide concentrations. For more information, refer to the appendix of "Soft Sensors for Monitoring and Control of Industrial Processes". The dataset features include air flow and gas flow variables.

Keywords: sulfur recovery, acid gas streams, environmental pollutants, elemental sulfur, by-product, gas flows, air flows, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide concentrations.
