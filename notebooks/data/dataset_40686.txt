Solar Flare Database

The Solar Flare database contains three potential classes, one for the number of times a certain type of solar flare occurred in a twenty-four hour period. Each instance represents captured features for one active region on the sun. The data are divided into two sections. The second section has had much more error correction applied to it, and has consequently been treated as more reliable.

Attribute Information

The database includes thirteen attributes, including three class attributes. The attributes are as follows: Code for Class, which is a modified Zurich class; Code for Largest Spot Size; Code for Spot Distribution; Activity, which indicates whether the activity is reduced or unchanged; Evolution, which indicates whether the region is decaying, not growing, or growing; Previous Twenty-Four Hour Flare Activity Code, which indicates the level of flare activity in the previous twenty-four hours; Historically Complex, which indicates whether the region is historically complex or not; Did Region Become Historically Complex, which indicates whether the region became historically complex on this pass across the sun's disk; Area, which indicates whether the region is small or large; Area of the Largest Spot, which indicates whether the area of the largest spot is less than or equal to five or greater than five. From these predictors, three classes of flares are predicted, which are represented in the last three columns: C-Class Flares Production, M-Class Flares Production, and X-Class Flares Production.
