The Solar Flare database contains three potential classes, each representing the number of times a specific type of solar flare occurred in a twenty-four-hour period. Each instance in the database represents captured features for one active region on the Sun.

The data are divided into two sections. The second section, which has undergone extensive error correction, is considered more reliable. 

Attribute information includes:

Code for Class, which represents the modified Zurich classification; 
Code for Largest Spot Size; 
Code for Spot Distribution; 
Activity, indicating whether it was reduced or unchanged;
Evolution, denoting whether there was decay, no growth, or growth;
Previous Twenty-Four Hour Flare Activity Code;
Historically Complex, indicating whether the region became historically complex on its pass across the Sun's disk;
Area, classified as either small or large;
Area of the Largest Spot, categorized as less than or equal to five or greater than five;

From these predictors, three classes of flares are predicted, represented in the last three columns:

C-Class Flares Production by this Region, indicating the number of common flares produced in the next twenty-four hours;
M-Class Flares Production by this Region, representing the number of moderate flares produced in the next twenty-four hours;
X-Class Flares Production by this Region, indicating the number of severe flares produced in the next twenty-four hours;
