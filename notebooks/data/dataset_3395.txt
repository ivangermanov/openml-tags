QSAR-TID-13024 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 13024. The dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Somatostatin Receptor Two. This receptor is a single protein, also known as Smstr Two, Somatostatin Receptor Type Two, SRIF-One, SS Two R, and SS-Two-R. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor family, and short peptide receptor family.

The receptor is found in the cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and membrane, and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, spermatogenesis, cerebellum development, peristalsis, forebrain development, somatostatin signaling pathway, response to starvation, cellular response to glucocorticoid stimulus, and cellular response to estradiol stimulus.
