The ACS Income dataset is one of five datasets created as an improved alternative to the popular UCI Adult dataset. The dataset was compiled from data obtained from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample. The data provides information for all fifty states and Puerto Rico. This particular upload represents the raw data from a specific year.

The dataset contains a significant amount of data, with each entry consisting of ten features and one target variable. Additionally, a column for the state code has been included for convenience. Each of these columns is thoroughly described in the original publication and in the Public Use Microdata Sample Data Dictionary.

Further details about the dataset can also be found through the accompanying online repository.
