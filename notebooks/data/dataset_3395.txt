The QSAR-TID-13024 dataset, tagged with Machine Learning, Meteorology, and MTLQSAR, is part of the MetaQSAR project. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 13024.

This dataset has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty features.

This dataset is related to somatostatin receptor two, also known as smstr two, somatostatin receptor type two, SRIF-one, SS two R, and SS-two-R. It is a single protein preferred name and belongs to the species group Mus musculus.

The protein target classification is one point membrane receptor slash family A G protein-coupled receptor slash peptide receptor, and it is classified under short peptide receptor family A GPCR.

The description of this protein target is that it is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, spermatogenesis, cerebellum development, peristalsis, forebrain development, somatostatin signaling pathway, response to starvation, cellular response to glucocorticoid stimulus, and cellular response to estradiol stimulus.
