This function subsamples the dataset by uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows. It starts by selecting classes, ensuring the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns if required, ensuring the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. Finally, it stratifies the data according to the target variable and selects the required number of rows.
