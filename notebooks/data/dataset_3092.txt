QSAR-TID-10009 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Orexin Receptor One, and it has seven hundred fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other features representing FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

Orexin Receptor One is a Single Protein, also known as Hypocretin Receptor Type One, Orexin/Hypocretin Receptor Type One, Orexin Receptor Type One, Ox One R. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens, and its protein target classification is One, Membrane Receptor/Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor/Peptide Receptor family A GPCR/Short Peptide Receptor family A GPCR/Orexin Receptor.

It is described as Orexin/Hypocretin Receptor Type One, and it has relationships with Cannabinoid CB One receptor/orexin receptor one complex, and Orexin Receptor family.

Some parent molecules include Daridorexant, Lemboorexant, and SB-Six Four Nine Eight Sixty-Eight, which are small molecules acting as orexin receptor one antagonists.
