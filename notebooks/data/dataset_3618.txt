QSAR-TID-12512 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12512. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The Adenosine A1 receptor, also known as Adora1, is a single protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is primarily found in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes, including temperature homeostasis, response to hypoxia, and regulation of respiratory gaseous exchange by nervous system process.

The receptor is also associated with several diseases and disorders, including acute inflammatory response, leukocyte migration, and cardiovascular disease. It has been shown to play a role in the regulation of cell communication, lipid catabolic process, and synaptic transmission.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the Adenosine A1 receptor, and can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of various diseases and disorders.
