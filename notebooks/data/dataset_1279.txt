The QSAR-TID-102421 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102421. This dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features represent fingerprints of molecular structures, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. The data shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102421.

The target is a single protein, specifically serine/threonine-protein kinase Nek three, also known as HSPK thirty-six or Never in Mitosis A-related Kinase three. It belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/other protein kinase group, specifically the Nek family.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including the mitotic cell cycle, protein phosphorylation, and cell division. It is expressed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, axon, and cell projections, and its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, and metal ion binding.
