QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Matrix metalloproteinase, also known as Matrix metalloproteinase, Membrane type matrix metalloproteinase, MMP, and MMP. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAM clan/Metallo protease MA subfamily.

The protein is associated with various cellular components including the extracellular region, extracellular space, Golgi lumen, plasma membrane, cell surface, and extracellular matrix. Its functions include metalloendopeptidase activity, enzyme activator activity, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.

The protein is involved in numerous biological processes such as skeletal system development, ossification, endochondral ossification, proteolysis, protein processing, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, chondrocyte proliferation, embryonic cranial skeleton morphogenesis, bone development, and craniofacial suture morphogenesis.

Additional information about this protein can be found in various databases including ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, GoProcess, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
