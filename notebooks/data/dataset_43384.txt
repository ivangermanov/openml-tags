Diabetes Data Set 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict, based on various diagnostic measurements, whether a patient has diabetes or not. 

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. Specifically, all patients included in this dataset are female, at least twenty-one years old, and of Pima Indian heritage. 

The dataset includes several variables, including the number of times a woman has been pregnant, her plasma glucose concentration after a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test, her diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, two-hour serum insulin level, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, age, and outcome, which is the class variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.

Past research using this dataset includes a study that employed the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus. The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated in this study is whether the patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization criteria. The population studied lives near Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America.

The results of the study showed that the ADAP algorithm made a real-valued prediction between zero and one, which was then transformed into a binary decision using a certain cutoff value. Using a large number of training instances, the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were found to be relatively high on the remaining instances.

It is worth noting that several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. Specifically, all patients included in this dataset are female, at least twenty-one years old, and of Pima Indian heritage. The ADAP algorithm is an adaptive learning routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like devices, making it a unique algorithm.
