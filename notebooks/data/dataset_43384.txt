Diabetes Data Set
Tags: Context

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict, based on diagnostic measurements, whether a patient has diabetes.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least twenty-one years old of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes several diagnostic measurements, including the number of times pregnant, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, two-hour serum insulin, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

The dataset was previously used to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus using the ADAP learning algorithm. The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization criteria. The population lives near Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

The ADAP algorithm makes a real-valued prediction between zero and one. This was transformed into a binary decision using a cutoff. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were evaluated using a training set and a test set.

Relevant information about the dataset includes the fact that several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least twenty-one years old of Pima Indian heritage. The ADAP algorithm is an adaptive learning routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like devices.
