Electricity Load Diagrams Dataset

The dataset has no missing values. The values are in kilowatts for each fifteen-minute interval. To convert the values to kilowatt-hours, they must be divided by four. Each column represents one client. Some clients were created after 2011, and in these cases, their consumption was considered zero. All time labels report to Portuguese hour. However, all days present ninety-six measures (twenty-four hours multiplied by four). Every year, on the March time change day, which has only twenty-three hours, the values between one am and two am are zero for all points. Every year, on the October time change day, which has twenty-five hours, the values between one am and two am aggregate the consumption of two hours.

The dataset was saved as a text file using a comma-separated values format, with a semi-colon as the separator. The first column presents the date and time as a string in the format 'year-month-day hour:minute:second'. The other columns present float values with consumption in kilowatts.

Preprocessing steps included renaming the first column to 'date', dropping rows with the year less than or equal to 2011, and dropping columns where the percentage of zero entries was greater than ten percent. This effectively dropped fifty-four columns.

The dataset features include the date and time, as well as various client identifiers.
