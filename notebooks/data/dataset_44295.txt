**Meta-Album Airplanes Dataset (Mini)**

The original Airplanes dataset comprises a large collection of remote sensing images acquired from Google Earth satellite imagery, including twenty-one different types of aircraft from around thirty-six airports. All the images were carefully labeled by specialists in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. Each class can have a varying number of images, where each image contains only one complete aircraft, and they have variable resolutions. To preprocess this dataset, we cropped the images from either side to make them square, and then we resized them into a uniform size using an anti-aliasing filter.
