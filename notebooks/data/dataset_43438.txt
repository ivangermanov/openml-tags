The Goodreads Books dataset is a collection of information scraped from the popular book review website Goodreads. Due to the limitations of the official Goodreads API, this dataset was created by scraping the actual HTTP pages to gather additional details on each book.

The books in this dataset were scraped from the list titled "Best Books Ever", which can be found on the Goodreads website. This list is a curated collection of highly rated and popular books.

The dataset contains a wide range of features, including the book's title, link, series information, cover link, rating count, review count, average rating, and rating distribution. It also includes information about the book's publication, such as the number of pages, publication date, and publisher. Additionally, the dataset contains information about the book's genre, awards, and settings, as well as links to related books and authors.

The dataset also includes a description of each book, which provides a brief summary of the book's plot and themes.
