This dataset, referred to as Chaos Detection in Duffing System, is categorized under the domains of Economics and Government. It consists of an artificial simulation of the Duffing system, which undergoes random transitions between chaotic and non-chaotic regimes at varying noise levels.

The dataset comprises various features, including the Index, Time, Y coordinate, X coordinate, Coordinate One, Maximum values over ten, twenty, and fifty intervals, Mean values over ten, twenty, and fifty intervals, Minimum values over ten, twenty, and fifty intervals, Fourier Wave One, Fourier Wave Two, Number of Holes, Average Lifetime, Betti Numbers Zero, One, Two, Betti Argument Maximum One, Betti Argument Maximum Two, Amplitude, Noise Level, and Test Set.

Keywords: Chaos Detection, Duffing System, Artificial Simulation, Noise Levels, Economics, Government.
