The sulfur recovery unit removes environmental pollutants from acid gas streams before they are released into the atmosphere, thereby minimizing the negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, elemental sulfur is recovered as a valuable by-product, which can be utilized in various industrial applications.

The sulfur recovery unit process involves five input variables, namely gas flow and air flow, which are crucial in determining the efficiency of the unit. The primary objective of the unit is to predict two output variables, specifically the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide.
