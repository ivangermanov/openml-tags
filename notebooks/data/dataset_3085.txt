QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a single protein target, namely Myosin light chain kinase, smooth muscle. This protein is also known as Kinase related protein KRP MLCK MLCK MYLK. It is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase MLCK family classification.

The target protein is associated with various cellular components, including stress fibers, cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, actin cytoskeleton, lamellipodium, cleavage furrow, and cell projections. Its functions encompass nucleotide binding, actin binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, myosin light chain kinase activity, protein binding, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding.

The protein is involved in numerous biological processes, such as protein phosphorylation, smooth muscle contraction, tonic smooth muscle contraction, phosphorylation, positive regulation of cell migration, bleb assembly, positive regulation of calcium ion transport, aorta smooth muscle tissue morphogenesis, cellular hypotonic response, and positive regulation of wound healing.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is valuable for researchers studying drug target interactions, molecular fingerprints, and quantitative structure activity relationships in pharmaceutical research and development.
