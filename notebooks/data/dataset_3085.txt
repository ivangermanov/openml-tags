QSAR-TID-10250 Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10250. It consists of one hundred twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is essential to cite this source when utilizing the dataset.

The features included in this dataset are molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each compound, while the median pXC fifty represents the activity value of each compound.

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. 

Scraped Data:

The target protein is myosin light chain kinase, smooth muscle. It belongs to the enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CAMK protein kinase group, CAMK protein kinase MLCK family. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including stress fiber, cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, actin cytoskeleton, lamellipodium, cleavage furrow, and cell projection.

It has been found to be associated with nucleotide binding, actin binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, myosin light chain kinase activity, protein binding, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding.

In terms of its role in biological processes, it participates in protein phosphorylation, smooth muscle contraction, tonic smooth muscle contraction, phosphorylation, positive regulation of cell migration, bleb assembly, positive regulation of calcium ion transport, aorta smooth muscle tissue morphogenesis, cellular hypotonic response, and positive regulation of wound healing.
