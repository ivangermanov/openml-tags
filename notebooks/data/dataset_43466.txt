Bank Note Authentication UCI 

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged bank note-like specimens. To facilitate this process, an industrial camera typically employed for print inspection was utilized. The resulting images possess a high level of detail, with a pixel count of four hundred by four hundred. Furthermore, due to the characteristics of the object lens and the distance to the investigated object, grayscale pictures with an exceptionally high resolution were obtained. 

In order to extract relevant features from these images, a Wavelet Transform tool was employed. This feature extraction process yielded several important characteristics, including variance and entropy, which served to distinguish between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.
