Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera, typically used for print inspection, was utilized. The final images have a high resolution. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object, gray-scale pictures with a high level of detail were obtained. A Wavelet Transform tool was used to extract features from the images. The features extracted include variance, skewness, and entropy, which are used to classify the images into their respective classes.
