The QSAR-TID-12807 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One A Angiotensin Two Receptor. This dataset has one hundred forty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Fingerprints six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The preferred name of this target is Type One A Angiotensin Two Receptor. It also has synonyms such as Agtr One, Agtr One A, Angiotensin Two Type-One Receptor A, At One A, and AT One Receptor A.

This target belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified as a single protein. It is a membrane receptor belonging to family A G protein coupled receptor, peptide receptor family A GPCR, and short peptide receptor family A GPCR.

This target has relationships with other targets such as Angiotensin Two Receptor and Angiotensin Two Type-One Receptor.

It is involved in various biological processes such as blood vessel development, positive regulation of cytokine production, kidney development, and regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by circulatory renin-angiotensin.

It is also involved in various cellular components such as cytoplasm, endosome, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and basolateral plasma membrane.
