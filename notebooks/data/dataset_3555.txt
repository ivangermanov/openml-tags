CERN Electron Collision Data

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Context:
This dataset contains one hundred thousand dielectron events in the invariant mass range of two to one hundred ten gigaelectronvolts for use in outreach and education. These data were carefully selected for educational and outreach purposes and contain a subset of the total event information. It is important to note that the selection criteria used in this dataset may differ from those employed in CMS physics results.

Content:

The dataset includes various features that describe the properties of the electrons and their interactions. Each event is identified by a unique run number and event number. The total energy of each electron is recorded, as well as its momentum components, including the x, y, and z axes. Additionally, the transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and phi angle of each electron are included. The charge of each electron is also recorded. Finally, the invariant mass of the two electrons is calculated.

Acknowledgements:
The data were obtained from the CERN Open Data Portal, which provides access to a wide range of datasets from high-energy physics experiments. The open data are released under the Creative Commons CC0 waiver, which allows users to freely access and utilize the data without restrictions. It is essential to cite the dataset using its unique digital object identifier (DOI) in any applications or publications that utilize the data.
