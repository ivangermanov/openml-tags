This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex Australian Dollar versus Canadian Dollar (AUDCAD) exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one daily candlestick. The dataset spans from January to December and excludes weekends, as Forex markets are closed during these periods. The timestamp feature is based on the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The dataset is designed for hypothetical scientific analysis, and realistic trading strategies should only be applied to predictions based on closing prices. The class attribute indicates whether the mean high price will increase or decrease (or remain the same) in the following day compared to the current day.
