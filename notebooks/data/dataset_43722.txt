Gen-1 Pokémon Dataset Tags: Economics, Machine Learning

This dataset consists of the original 151 Pokémon with statistics only from Generation 1. The data was scraped from Serebii.net.

The dataset contains information about each Pokémon, including its Pokédex index, name, types, primary type, secondary type (if applicable), height in meters, weight in kilograms, probability of encountering a male or female in percentage, capture rate (which measures how difficult it is to capture the Pokémon), experience points needed to fully level up, experience speed (which determines how fast a Pokémon fully levels up), and the sum of all its base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special, and Speed).

Additionally, the dataset includes each Pokémon's base stats, such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special, and Speed, as well as the multiplicative damage it takes from certain types (Normal, Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, and Dragon).

The dataset also provides information on the number of evolutions each base Pokémon has and whether it is legendary or not.
