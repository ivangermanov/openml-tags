**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex CHF/SGD currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price of the following day, relative to the mean high price of the current day. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean high price is expected to increase the following day, and false if the mean high price is expected to decrease or remain the same the following day.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended for scientific research purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should only be applied to predictions based on close attributes (which are also available).**
