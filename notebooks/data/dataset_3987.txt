QSAR-TID-11871 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Twelve, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Twelve. Matrix Metalloproteinase Twelve is a single protein, also known as Macrophage Elastase, Macrophage Metalloelastase, and Matrix Metalloproteinase Twelve. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M ten A subfamily.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project involves the collection and curation of QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL, and the generation of molecular fingerprints using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Twelve is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including proteolysis, extracellular matrix disassembly, and wound healing. It is also involved in the regulation of defense response to virus by host and the response to amyloid-beta.
