QSAR-TID-18046 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 18046. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 18046. The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50, which are used to represent the compounds and their activities.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is related to Plasmepsin 2, a single protein target that is also known as Aspartic Hemoglobinase II, PfAPD, PfPM1, and Plasmepsin II. It is an enzyme that belongs to the Aspartic Protease family and is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and acquisition of nutrients from host.

The dataset is annotated with various Gene Ontology terms, including vacuole, vacuolar membrane, vacuolar lumen, membrane, food vacuole, and cytostome. It is also annotated with UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam IDs, which provide additional information about the protein target.
