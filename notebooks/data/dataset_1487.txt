Abstract: This collection includes two ground ozone level data sets. The first is the eight-hour peak set (eighthr.data), and the second is the one-hour peak set (onehr.data). The data were collected from 1998 to 2004 in the Houston, Galveston, and Brazoria area.

Data Set Information: The attributes beginning with T represent temperature measurements taken at various times throughout the day, while those starting with WS indicate wind speed at different times. Some key attributes include:

WSR_PK: Continuous. Peak wind speed (resultant, average of wind vector)
WSR_AV: Continuous. Average wind speed
T_PK: Continuous. Peak temperature
T_AV: Continuous. Average temperature
T85: Continuous. Temperature at 850 hPa level (approximately 1500 m height)
RH85: Continuous. Relative Humidity at 850 hPa
U85: Continuous. U wind (east-west direction wind at 850 hPa)
V85: Continuous. V wind (north-south direction wind at 850 hPa)
HT85: Continuous. Geopotential height at 850 hPa (similar to height at low altitude)

The dataset also includes measurements at 700 hPa (roughly 3100 m height) and 500 hPa (roughly 5500 m height) levels, as well as other meteorological indices such as K-Index, T-Totals, Sea Level Pressure, and precipitation.

Attribute Information: Several important attributes highly valued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) are specified, including:

O3: Local ozone peak prediction
Upwind: Upwind ozone background level
EmFactor: Precursor emissions related factor
Tmax: Maximum temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
Tb: Base temperature where net ozone production begins (50Â°F)
SRd: Solar radiation total for the day
WSa: Wind speed near sunrise (using 09-12 UTC forecast mode)
WSp: Wind speed mid-day (using 15-21 UTC forecast mode)

Relevant Papers: The dataset is discussed in detail in "Forecasting skewed biased stochastic ozone days: analyses, solutions and beyond" (Knowledge and Information Systems, Vol. 14, No. 3, 2008). This paper covers the dataset's use and various experiments using state-of-the-art methods, including cross-validation and streaming approaches. A shorter version of the paper, focusing on analyses and solutions, was presented at ICDM 2006.
