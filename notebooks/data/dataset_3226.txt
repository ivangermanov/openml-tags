The QSAR-TID-103452 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103452. It has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide high-quality QSAR datasets for machine learning and mathematical modeling. The dataset is suitable for machine learning and mathematical modeling studies, particularly those focused on multi-target QSAR modeling.

The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Six enzyme is the target of interest in this dataset. It is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase Two, ASK Two, MAP Three Kinase Six, MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase Six, and MEK Kinase Six. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group.
