QSAR-TID-103452 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Six, and it has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and one thousand twenty-four FCFP Six features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September Two Thousand Fifteen.

The target protein is Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Six, also known as Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase Two, MAP Three Kinase Six, MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase Six, and MEK Kinase Six. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, specifically a STE protein kinase, STE Eleven family, and STE protein kinase ASK.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and phosphorylation. It has nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase kinase kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding functions.
