This dataset contains information on peptides annotated for their one-letter amino acid code and their anticancer activity on breast cancer cell lines. Membranolytic anticancer peptides are drawing increasing attention as potential future therapeutics against cancer, due to their ability to hinder the development of cellular resistance and their potential to overcome common hurdles of chemotherapy, such as side effects and cytotoxicity.

The dataset contains three attributes: peptide identification number, one-letter amino acid sequence, and class. The class attribute has four categories: active, moderately active, experimentally inactive, and virtually inactive.

The peptides in this dataset were curated manually from CancerPPD, a database of anticancer peptides. The dataset includes information on the peptides' anticancer activity, including EC50, IC50, LD50, and LC50 values, which were converted from milligrams per milliliter to micromolar units. Only linear and L-chiral peptides were included, while cyclic, mixed, or D-chiral peptides were excluded.

In cases where there were multiple values for the same sequence, only the value referred to the amidated peptide was retained. Peptides were then classified into three categories based on their anticancer activity: very active, moderately active, and inactive. Duplicates with conflicting class annotations were manually reviewed and corrected.

To address the bias towards active peptides in CancerPPD, a set of presumably inactive peptides was generated by randomly extracting alpha-helical sequences from crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. These peptides were added to the dataset to provide a more balanced representation of active and inactive peptides.
