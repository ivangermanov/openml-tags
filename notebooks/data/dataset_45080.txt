This dataset consists of three types of entities: the specification of an automobile in terms of various characteristics, its assigned insurance risk rating, and its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the automobile is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky or less, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up or down the scale. This process is called symboling. A high value indicates that the automobile is risky, while a low value indicates that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all automobiles within a particular size classification, such as two-door small, station wagons, sports/specialty, and so on, and represents the average loss per car per year.

Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a class attribute.

The Automobile Dataset features a range of characteristics, including the automobile's physical dimensions, engine specifications, fuel type, and other relevant details.
