Fri C Three Five Hundred Twenty-Five is a binarized regression problem dataset that originates from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is a part of several studies, including Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, Study Seven, and Study Eighty-Eight.

The dataset has undergone a transformation where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'.

The features included in this dataset are numerous, but unfortunately, they consist of unreadable codes, namely oz one through oz twenty-five, which cannot be converted into human-readable format.

Binary Class is also a notable aspect of this dataset.
