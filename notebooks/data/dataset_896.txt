**AR6 / Software Defect Prediction**

The dataset was created on an unspecified date and contains data from a Turkish white goods manufacturer. It was donated by the Software Research Laboratory (SoftLab) at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey. The laboratory's website is located at http://softlab.boun.edu.tr.

**Description**

The dataset consists of embedded software in a white goods product implemented in the C programming language. It comprises one hundred and one modules, fifteen of which are defective and eighty-six of which are defect-free. There are twenty-nine static code attributes, including McCabe, Halstead, and Lines of Code measures, as well as one defect information attribute indicating whether each module is defective or not. These function or method-level static code attributes were collected using the Prest Metrics Extraction and Analysis Tool.

**Features**

The dataset includes various features such as total lines of code, blank lines of code, comment lines of code, code and comment lines of code, executable lines of code, and several Halstead and McCabe complexity measures.
