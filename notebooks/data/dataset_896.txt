Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: [omitted due to being human unreadable]

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification task. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean threshold, respectively.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies and appears to be part of a larger collection of datasets used for various research purposes, including mythbusting and regression analysis. While the original source and date of creation are unknown, it is clear that this version is derived from an earlier dataset and has been specifically processed for binary classification tasks.

The features of the dataset are not easily interpretable by humans, suggesting they may be anonymized or represent complex measurements or calculations. The binary class serves as the target variable for classification tasks using this dataset.
