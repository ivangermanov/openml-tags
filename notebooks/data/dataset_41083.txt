The Olivetti Faces dataset contains a collection of face images taken between April nineteen ninety-two and April nineteen ninety-four at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. 

There are multiple images of each of forty distinct subjects, with variations including different lighting conditions, facial expressions, and facial details. The images feature a dark, homogeneous background, with the subjects positioned upright and facing forward, allowing for some degree of side movement.

Each image has been quantized to two hundred fifty-six grey levels and stored as unsigned eight-bit integers. These values are then converted to floating-point values within the interval zero to one, making them more suitable for use with various machine learning algorithms.

This dataset is particularly intriguing when approached from an unsupervised or semi-supervised perspective, given the limited number of examples available for each class.

When utilizing these images, please provide credit to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.
