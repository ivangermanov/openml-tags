Olivetti Faces Tags: Vision

This dataset contains a set of face images taken at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge between April 1992 and April 1994. There are ten different images of each of forty distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions, such as open or closed eyes, smiling or not smiling, and facial details, such as glasses or no glasses. All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position, with tolerance for some side movement.

The image is quantized to 256 grey levels and stored as unsigned eight-bit integers; the loader will convert these to floating point values on the interval from zero to one, which are easier to work with for many algorithms. The target for this database is an integer indicating the identity of the person pictured; however, with only ten examples per class, this relatively small dataset is more interesting from an unsupervised or semi-supervised perspective.

The original dataset consisted of images with a resolution of ninety-two by one hundred twelve, while the version available here consists of sixty-four by sixty-four images. When using these images, please give credit to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.
