AutoUniv Dataset 

Dataset Title: AutoUniv Dataset 

Abstract: 
The AutoUniv dataset is an advanced data generator designed for classification tasks, aiming to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real-world data. This dataset can be generated in various formats, including comma-separated values, ARFF, or C4.5.

Data Set Information: 
To utilize this dataset, users must first create a classification model and then generate classified examples from it. In creating a model, users specify the number of attributes, which can be either discrete or continuous, the number of classes, the complexity of the underlying rules, and the desired noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy the user's requirements.

The resulting model can have multiple rules, and rare class models can be designed. Additionally, a sequence of models can be created to reflect concept drift or population drift over time. AutoUniv generates three text files for each model: a Prolog specification of the model, a user-friendly statement of the classification rules, and a statistical summary of the model's main properties.

Attribute Information: 
Attributes within the dataset may be either discrete or continuous. Discrete attributes can be further categorized as nominal or integer values.
