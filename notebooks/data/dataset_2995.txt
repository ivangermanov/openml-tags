Multiclass from Binary: Expanding One versus All, One versus One and Error Correcting Output Codes-Based Approaches 

The dataset used for this study was obtained from LIBSVM, a library for support vector machines, which provides a wide range of datasets for multiclass classification problems. The specific dataset used has a fixed target attribute, which is given as a nominal feature.

This dataset contains a large number of features, many of which are not easily readable by humans. However, it is worth noting that these features are an essential part of the dataset and play a crucial role in the multiclass classification problem being addressed.

The study expands on three different approaches to multiclass classification, namely, one versus all, one versus one, and error correcting output codes-based approaches. These approaches have been widely used in machine learning and have shown promising results in various applications.
