QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is associated with the MetaQSAR project from September. It focuses on the Ghrelin receptor, also known as GH releasing peptide receptor, GHRP, Ghsr, and GHS R. This is a single protein target found in Rattus norvegicus. The receptor belongs to the membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the peptide receptor and short peptide receptor subgroups. It is classified as a GRP related receptor.

The Ghrelin receptor is involved in numerous biological processes and functions. It is found in various cellular components including the plasma membrane, cell surface, neuron projections, membrane rafts, synaptic membranes, and glutamatergic synapses. Its functions include growth hormone secretagogue receptor activity, G protein coupled receptor activity, hormone binding, and peptide hormone binding.

Key biological processes involving this receptor include signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling, spermatogenesis, feeding behavior, hormone response, appetite regulation, growth regulation, insulin signaling, ghrelin secretion, fatty acid metabolism, synapse assembly, and various other physiological and cellular responses. The receptor plays important roles in growth, metabolism, and neurological functions.
