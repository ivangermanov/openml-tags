Dataset: BME Dataset
Tags: Dataset for Biomedical Engineering

This dataset features a range of exciting variables, including the Exciting Force, which measures the energy exerted on an object, and the Peak of the Glottal Flow, which represents the maximum flow rate of air through the glottis. Another important feature is the Excitation Moment, which captures the instant when the excitation force is applied. The Peak Moment, on the other hand, represents the maximum moment of the excitation force.

In addition to these features, the dataset also includes the Closed Quotient, which is a measure of the proportion of time the glottis is closed. The Total Energy Discrete and Total Energy ESD features provide information about the overall energy of the system. The Mean, Variance, Skewness, and Kurtosis features offer statistical insights into the distribution of the data.

The dataset is categorized into different classes, which are not specified.
