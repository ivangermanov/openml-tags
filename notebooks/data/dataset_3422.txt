The QSAR-TID-12593 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Ten, also known as Stromelysin Two. This dataset has twenty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule Chembl IDs and class feature Median Px C Fifty.

Features include molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project and was sourced from Chembl version seventeen.
