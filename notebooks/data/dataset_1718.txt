QSAR-TID-12910 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12910. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
