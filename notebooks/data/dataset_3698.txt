The QSAR-TID-12793 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 12793. This dataset has eighty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.

The compound activity values are represented in units of pseudo-pCI50. The dataset provides information about the molecular structure of the compounds, which can be used to predict their biological activities.

The dataset is related to the Retinoid X Receptor Gamma, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Three, Rxrg, or Nr2b3. It is a protein that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor family and plays an important role in various biological processes, including gene expression, cell differentiation, and tissue development.

The protein target classification of this dataset is Transcription Factor/Nuclear Receptor/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B/Nuclear Hormone Receptor Subfamily Two Group B Member Three.
