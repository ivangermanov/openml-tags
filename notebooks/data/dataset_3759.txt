QSAR-TID-69 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme is a single protein with the preferred name Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, and it has synonyms such as ACE, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, soluble form, CD antigen equals CD one forty-three, and DCP. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and has a protein target classification of one point Enzyme, Protease, Metallo protease, Metallo protease MAE clan, Metallo protease M two family.

The dataset has multiple features, including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one zero two four features. The features are human unreadable, but they represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme is involved in multiple biological processes, including response to hypoxia, kidney development, blood vessel remodeling, angiotensin maturation, regulation of renal output by angiotensin, neutrophil mediated immunity, antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class one, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by renin-angiotensin, positive regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, proteolysis, peptide metabolic process, spermatogenesis, female pregnancy, regulation of blood pressure, male gonad development, response to xenobiotic stimulus, embryo development ending in birth or egg hatching, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of gene expression, substance P catabolic process, bradykinin catabolic process, regulation of smooth muscle cell migration, regulation of vasoconstriction, lung development, animal organ regeneration, response to nutrient levels, negative regulation of protein binding, positive regulation of protein binding, response to lipopolysaccharide, mononuclear cell proliferation, response to laminar fluid shear stress, vasoconstriction, hormone metabolic process, hormone catabolic process, eating behavior, positive regulation of apoptotic process, peptide catabolic process, positive regulation of blood pressure, positive regulation of vasoconstriction, negative regulation of glucose import, regulation of synaptic plasticity, lung alveolus development, amyloid-beta metabolic process, arachidonic acid secretion, positive regulation of neurogenesis, heart contraction, regulation of angiotensin metabolic process, hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, angiogenesis involved in coronary vascular morphogenesis, positive regulation of protein tyrosine kinase activity, cellular response to glucose stimulus, response to dexamethasone, cell proliferation in bone marrow, negative regulation of calcium ion import, response to thyroid hormone, blood vessel diameter maintenance, positive regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation, regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, negative regulation of gap junction assembly, cellular response to aldosterone, positive regulation of peptidyl-cysteine S-nitrosylation.
