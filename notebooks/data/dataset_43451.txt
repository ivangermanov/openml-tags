Context: I am currently writing a seminar paper about Content Summarization in Twitter Networks. One of the frameworks I read about uses a Peak Detection Algorithm to cluster tweets by topic-aware peak times. I started wondering if there are any interesting peak detection approaches. Feel free to play around with the data and provide your peak detection algorithms! They don't necessarily have to be machine learning algorithms.

The Peak-Detection-Dataset features a series of signal data points, which can be analyzed to identify patterns and trends. 

The target of this dataset is to identify peaks in the signal data.
