Peak Detection Dataset
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

I am currently writing a seminar paper about Content Summarization in Twitter Networks. One of the frameworks I read about utilizes a peak detection algorithm to cluster tweets by topic-aware peak times. This sparked my curiosity, and I began to wonder whether there exist other fascinating peak detection approaches. I invite you to explore this dataset and propose innovative peak detection algorithms, which do not necessarily need to be machine learning-based.

The dataset features a series of signals across multiple days, ideal for identifying patterns and anomalies.
