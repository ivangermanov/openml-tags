TVS Loan Default Dataset: Demographics, Health

The Personal Loan product is an unsecured loan, and therefore, it is essential to assess the risk of customers by evaluating their creditworthiness. This assessment is critical to prevent loan defaults. 

The primary objective is to develop a Risk Model using this dataset, which will evaluate the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their loan payments after cross-selling the Personal Loan.

This dataset comprises various attributes that provide insights into the customers' behavior, financial history, and demographic characteristics. 

These attributes include Customer Identification, Bouncing History, Credit Profile, Loan Details, Employment Information, Residential Status, Date of Birth, Age, Loan Sanctioned Amount, and Geographical Location.

By analyzing these attributes, the Risk Model aims to identify high-risk customers who may default on their loan payments, enabling the lending institution to take necessary measures to mitigate potential losses.
