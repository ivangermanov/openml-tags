Thyroid disease records were supplied by the Garavan Institute, New South Wales Institute, Sydney, Australia.

The dataset consists of thirty attributes, including age, which is a continuous variable, and sex, which is an enumerated value. There are twenty-three discrete attributes, seven of which are continuous, and five percent of the values are missing.

The attributes include information about the patient's medical history, such as whether they are taking thyroxine, have had thyroid surgery, or have been treated with I131. The dataset also includes measurements of various thyroid hormones, such as TSH, T3, TT4, T4U, FTI, and TBG.

The referral source of the patients is also included, with six possible sources listed. The class attribute indicates whether the patient has hypothyroidism, primary hypothyroidism, compensated hypothyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism, or is negative for hypothyroidism.

The dataset was scraped from unknown sources and has undergone some processing to remove unnecessary information.
