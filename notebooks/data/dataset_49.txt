This file describes the contents of the heart disease directory. This directory contains four databases concerning heart disease diagnosis. All attributes are numeric valued. The data was collected from the following locations: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, and University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

Each database has the same instance format. While the databases have seventy six raw attributes, only fourteen of them are actually used. Thus two copies of each database have been made: one with all the attributes and one with the fourteen attributes actually used in past experiments.

The databases contain information on heart disease diagnosis. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from zero (no presence) to four. Experiments have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values one, two, three, four) from absence (value zero).

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been processed, containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

The databases include information such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

Past usage of this data includes international probability analysis for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, instance based prediction of heart disease presence, and conceptual clustering systems. Various machine learning techniques have been applied to this data, achieving accuracy rates between seventy four and eighty one percent.

This dataset contains missing attribute values, which are distinguished with the value negative nine point zero. The class distribution varies across the different databases, with the Cleveland database having the most balanced distribution.
