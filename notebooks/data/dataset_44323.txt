**The Meta Album Cars Dataset Extended**

The original Cars dataset was collected in two thousand thirteen and contains more than sixteen thousand images from one hundred ninety-six classes of cars. Most images are taken on the road, but some have different backgrounds, and each image has only one car. Each class can have a varying number of images of variable resolutions.
