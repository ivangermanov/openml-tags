Pol Dataset belongs to the Regression on Numerical Features benchmark. This dataset has been transformed in the same way as the one used in the Tabular Data Benchmark.

Original Description:
This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset consists of various features including several numerical attributes.
