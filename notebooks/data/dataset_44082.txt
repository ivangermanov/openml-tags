Pol Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "Regression on Numerical Features" benchmark. 

Original description: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive and all others as negative. 

The dataset features a range of variables, including several numerical features that are used to predict the target variable. 

Please cite the original source of the dataset when using it for research or other purposes.
