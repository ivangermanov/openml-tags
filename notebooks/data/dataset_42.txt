Soybean Dataset
Tags: OpenML, study, uci

This large soybean database from the UCI repository combines training and test data into a single file. It contains nineteen classes, though only the first fifteen have been commonly used in prior research. The last four classes are considered potentially unjustified due to having very few examples. The dataset includes thirty-five categorical attributes, both nominal and ordered. "Does not apply" is represented by "dna". Attribute values are numerically encoded, with the first value as "zero", the second as "one", and so on. Unknown values are denoted by a question mark.

Attribute Information:
The attributes cover various aspects of soybean plants and their environment, including planting date, plant stand, precipitation, temperature, hail occurrence, crop history, area damaged, severity of damage, seed treatment, germination rate, plant growth, leaf characteristics, stem conditions, fruiting bodies, decay, mycelium presence, internal discoloration, sclerotia, fruit pods, fruit spots, seed condition, mold growth, seed discoloration, seed size, shriveling, and root health.

Classes:
The dataset includes nineteen classes representing various soybean diseases and conditions, such as diaporthe stem canker, charcoal rot, rhizoctonia root rot, phytophthora rot, brown stem rot, powdery mildew, downy mildew, brown spot, bacterial blight, bacterial pustule, purple seed stain, anthracnose, phyllosticta leaf spot, alternaria leaf spot, frog eye leaf spot, diaporthe pod and stem blight, cyst nematode, two four d injury, and herbicide injury.

Relevant Research:
Previous studies have utilized this dataset for classification knowledge representation in noisy domains and concept simplification with predictive accuracy. The dataset has been widely used in machine learning research, particularly for developing and testing classification algorithms.

Missing Values:
The dataset contains missing values, which are represented by question marks in the attribute listings.

This comprehensive soybean disease dataset provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners in agriculture and plant pathology, enabling the development of diagnostic tools and predictive models for soybean diseases.
