QSAR-TID-249 Dataset

Tags: Economics, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 249.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, MEDIAN_PXC50 are included in the dataset.
