Name: QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and numerous FCFP fingerprint features.

The dataset relates to a serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR, also known as FK binding protein rapamycin complex associated protein, Frap, mammalian target of rapamycin, and mechanistic target of rapamycin. This protein is found in Rattus norvegicus and belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/atypical protein kinase group/atypical protein kinase PIKK family/atypical protein kinase FRAP subfamily.

The protein is involved in numerous biological processes including regulation of cell growth, protein phosphorylation, autophagy, cellular response to nutrients and starvation, neuronal development, muscle tissue development, and various signaling pathways. It is found in multiple cellular components including the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus.

The protein has various molecular functions such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and transcription factor binding. It is involved in several signaling pathways including TOR signaling, insulin response, and regulation of circadian rhythms.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains valuable information for quantitative structure-activity relationship studies related to the mTOR protein target.
