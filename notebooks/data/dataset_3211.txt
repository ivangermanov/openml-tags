QSAR-TID-20157 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20157. The dataset has sixty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20157. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor one, which is a single protein target.

The Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor one is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. It is a promising drug target for the treatment of obesity and related disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of novel therapeutic compounds targeting the Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor one.
