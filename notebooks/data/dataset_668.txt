This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification results in a more straightforward and interpretable outcome. The dataset consists of various features that are relevant to chemistry and life science studies. These features are crucial in understanding the relationships between different variables and their impact on the target outcome.
