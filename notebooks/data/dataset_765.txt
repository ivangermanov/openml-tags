Human Development Dataset has been converted into a binarized version, which involves transforming the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process involves calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The resulting dataset consists of several features, including Rank, Country, and Human Development Index.
