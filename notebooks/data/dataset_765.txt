The Anal Cat Data Apnea dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset, which involves converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This is achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

This dataset is relevant to various fields including Chemistry and Life Science, and is particularly useful for Mythbusting and Study purposes.

Features included in this dataset are Automatic and Subject.
