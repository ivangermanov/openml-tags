Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Automatic, Scorer, Subject, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Apnea, is a modified version of an original dataset focused on sleep apnea analysis. The primary modification involves binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a nominal classification with two distinct categories. This conversion process utilizes the mean value as a threshold, designating instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset is associated with mythbusting and various study-related tags, suggesting its potential use in scientific research and hypothesis testing. While the original source and date of creation remain unknown, users are encouraged to cite this binarized version when referencing the dataset in their work. The features included in this dataset provide information on automatic measurements, scorer evaluations, subject data, and the newly created binary classification.
