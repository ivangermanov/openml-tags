Dataset from the First ChaLearn Automated Machine Learning Challenge in Two Thousand Fourteen. 
Only the training data is included, as there were no labels available for the validation and test sets.

This dataset consists of various chemical compounds, each described by a large number of features, which represent different chemical properties and characteristics of these molecules.

Features include chemical properties such as molecular weight, atom counts, bond counts, and other chemical descriptors, among many others.
