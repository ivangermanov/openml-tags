QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Botulinum neurotoxin type A, a single protein target. Synonyms include atx bna bonT BoNT/A bonT GN. The organism is Clostridium botulinum. The protein target classification is Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAE clan/Metallo protease M family.

Gene Ontology annotations include extracellular region, membrane, host cell plasma membrane, host cell cytoplasm, host cell membrane, host cell cytoplasmic vesicle, host cell cytosol, host cell synapse, and host cell presynaptic membrane for cellular components. Molecular functions include metalloendopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, lipid binding, protein transmembrane transporter activity, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, toxin activity, and ganglioside GTb binding. Biological processes involve proteolysis, modulation of process of another organism, negative regulation of neurotransmitter secretion, and protein transmembrane transport.

The dataset contains information on related molecules, including antibodies that act as Botulinum neurotoxin type A inhibitors. It also includes references to various databases and resources such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe with associated identifiers and structural information.
