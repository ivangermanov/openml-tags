QSAR-TID-101110 Dataset: Machine Learning, Medicine, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101110. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset includes information about molecules, their chemical structures, and properties. It provides a comprehensive collection of data points for machine learning models to learn from and make predictions about the activity of various compounds.

The molecules in this dataset have been tested against a specific protein target, and their activity values have been recorded. These activity values can be used to train machine learning models to predict the activity of new, untested compounds.

The features in this dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing the chemical structure of a molecule as a binary string. These fingerprints can be used as input features for machine learning models.

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset provides a rich source of information for machine learning models to learn from and make predictions about the activity of various compounds.
