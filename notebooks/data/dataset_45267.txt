Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 4.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - Munin is a massive discrete Bayesian network.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex and challenging model to work with. The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes are relatively small, indicating that the network is sparse and has a relatively simple structure. However, the maximum in-degree of the nodes is three, which suggests that there are some nodes with a higher number of parents.

The Munin network is an expert EMG assistant, designed to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of muscle disorders. It is a powerful tool for medical professionals, providing a comprehensive and accurate model of the relationships between different muscle and nerve disorders.

Features of the Munin network include muscle and nerve characteristics, such as muscle size, muscle denervation, and nerve conduction velocity. The network also includes features related to muscle disorders, such as muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and muscle pain.
