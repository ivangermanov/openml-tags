Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 4.

This network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, a collection of Bayesian networks for research and education.

The Munin network is a discrete massive Bayesian network consisting of nodes representing various electromyographic findings and clinical variables. It was developed as an expert system for electromyographic diagnosis and has been used in medical research.

Features of this network include muscle activity, nerve conduction, and electromyographic signals, as well as variables related to muscle denervation and reinnervation.

Average Markov blanket size and average degree are important metrics describing the structure of the network.

Maximum in-degree is another key characteristic of the network.

Please cite the original publication when using this network.

Features include muscle activity measures, nerve conduction velocities, electromyographic signal patterns, and clinical findings related to muscle denervation and reinnervation, among others.

Keywords: Bayesian network, electromyography, medical diagnosis, muscle activity, nerve conduction.
