Uber and Lyft Dataset Boston MA Tags: Uber versus Lyft

This is a very beginner-friendly dataset, making it an excellent choice for those new to data analysis. Although it does contain a significant amount of missing values, it is still a valuable resource for exploring the relationships between various predictors and the price of rides. A linear regression model can be applied to identify patterns between factors such as the hour of the day and the price of a ride.

One of the most fascinating aspects of this dataset is the inclusion of corresponding weather data for each hour, providing a brief summary of the weather conditions. Other essential factors that can influence the price of a ride include temperature, wind speed, and the time of sunset.

The dataset features a range of variables, including the timestamp, hour, day, month, and datetime, as well as the source and destination of the ride, the type of cab, and the product ID. Additionally, it includes information about the price, distance, and surge multiplier, along with the latitude and longitude of the pickup location.

Weather-related variables are also included, such as the temperature, apparent temperature, and short and long summaries of the weather. Other weather factors include precipitation intensity, probability, and humidity, as well as wind speed, wind gust, and visibility.
