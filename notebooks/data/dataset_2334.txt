QSAR-TID-10962 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10962. It has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Demographic information includes the molecule ChEMBL ID, which serves as an identifier for each compound. 

Study three is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive QSAR dataset for various drug targets. 

The drug target TID: 10962 corresponds to Prolyl Endopeptidase, also known as Post-Proline Cleaving Enzyme or PREP. It belongs to the species Bos Taurus and is classified under the enzyme/protease/serine protease category.

Prolyl Endopeptidase is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis. It has serine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and oligopeptidase activity.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, prolyl endopeptidase, proteolysis, serine-type endopeptidase activity.
