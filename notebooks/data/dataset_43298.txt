Cause-Effect is a growing database with two-variable cause-effect pairs created at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in TÃ¼bingen, Germany.

Some pairs are high-dimensional, and for machine readability, the relevant information about this is coded in metadata. Metadata contains the following information: number of pair, first column of cause, last column of cause, first column of effect, last column of effect, and dataset weight. The dataset weight should be used for calculating average performance of causal inference methods to avoid a bias introduced by having multiple copies of essentially the same data.

When you use this dataset in a publication, please cite the paper that contains much more detailed information regarding this dataset in the supplement.

Overview of all data pairs:

Variable One    Variable Two    Dataset    Ground Truth
Altitude        Temperature    DWD        ->
Altitude        Precipitation    DWD        ->
Longitude        Temperature    DWD        ->
Altitude        Sunshine Hours    DWD        ->

Information for pair four: DWD data, taken from the German Weather Service, was taken at three hundred forty-nine stations. The data was taken from the website, and more recent links are also provided.

The dataset contains yearly values averaged over nineteen sixty-one to nineteen ninety. The ground truth is that altitude causes sunshine hours.
