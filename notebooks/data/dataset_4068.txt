Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

Original Description:

This dataset was collected from all the block groups in California from the nineteen ninety census. A block group, on average, includes individuals living in a geographically compact area. The geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. Distances among the centroids of each block group were computed as measured in latitude and longitude. All block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables were excluded. The final data contained observations on nine variables. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the median house value.

The variables were found to be significant in the following ways: Median Income has a positive effect; Median Income squared has a negative effect; Median Income cubed has a slight negative effect; the natural logarithm of Median Age has a positive effect; the natural logarithm of Total Rooms per Population has a strong negative effect; the natural logarithm of Bedrooms per Population has a strong positive effect; the natural logarithm of Population per Households has a moderate negative effect; and the natural logarithm of Households has a slight positive effect.
