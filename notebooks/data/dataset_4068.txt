QSAR-TID-100990 Tags: Health, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety, and it has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four one, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four two, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four three, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four four, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four five, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four six, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four seven, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four eight, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four nine, and many more.
