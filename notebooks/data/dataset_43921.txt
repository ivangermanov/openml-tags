Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of expert systems for decision making. This version drops duplicate rows.

The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure: Car Acceptability, which is influenced by Price, Technical Characteristics, and Comfort. 

Price is comprised of Buying Price and Maintenance Cost. Technical Characteristics encompass Comfort, which is further divided into Number of Doors, Capacity in Terms of Persons to Carry, Size of Luggage Boot, and Estimated Safety of the Car.

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept, the model includes three intermediate concepts: Price, Technical Characteristics, and Comfort. Every concept is related to its lower-level descendants by a set of examples. 

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, directly relating Car Acceptability to the six input attributes: Buying Price, Maintenance Cost, Number of Doors, Capacity in Terms of Persons to Carry, Size of Luggage Boot, and Estimated Safety of the Car.

Because of the known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.
