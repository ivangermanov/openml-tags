Name: KDD IPUMS LA Ninety Seven Small Seed Three

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset KDD IPUMS LA Ninety Seven Small with seed equal to three, arguments number of rows equal to two thousand, arguments number of columns equal to one hundred, arguments number of classes equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows. Finally, it returns a new dataset with the sampled data and the corresponding categorical mask and column names.

Features: value, rent, family size, number of children, elderly children, young children, number of siblings, age, occupation score, socioeconomic index, total income, wage income, business income, farm income, social security income, welfare income, other income, poverty, and binary class.
