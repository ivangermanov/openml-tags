The Emotions dataset is a multi-label audio dataset consisting of 593 musical files with six clustered emotional labels and seventy-two predictors. Each song can be labeled with one or more of the following emotions: Amazed-Surprised, Happy-Pleased, Relaxing-Calm, Quiet-Still, Sad-Lonely, and Angry-Aggressive.

This dataset contains various acoustic features that describe the audio files, including mean and standard deviation of acceleration, centroid, rolloff, flux, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).

Additionally, the dataset includes features related to beat histogram, such as low peak amplitude, high peak amplitude, high-low ratio, and sum of beat histogram values.

The Emotions dataset is suitable for training machine learning models to recognize and classify emotions in music.
