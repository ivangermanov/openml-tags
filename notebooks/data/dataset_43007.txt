The analysis is performed for different sets of input values using a methodology similar to that described in a research paper on taming instabilities in power grid networks by decentralized control. Several input values are kept the same, including an averaging time of two seconds, a coupling strength of eight per second squared, and damping of point one per second.

The dataset contains eleven predictive attributes and one non-predictive attribute, as well as two goal fields. The predictive attributes include reaction times of participants, nominal power consumed or produced, and coefficients proportional to price elasticity. The reaction times, denoted by tau, are real values ranging from point five to ten seconds, with tau one being the value for the electricity producer. The nominal power values, denoted by p, are real values, with p one being the absolute value of the sum of p two, p three, and p four. The coefficients, denoted by g, are real values ranging from point zero five to one per second, with g one being the value for the electricity producer.

The two goal fields are the maximal real part of the characteristic equation root, denoted by stab, which determines the linear stability of the system, and the stability label of the system, denoted by stabf, which is a categorical value indicating whether the system is stable or unstable.
