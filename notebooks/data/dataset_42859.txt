Segment Tags: Label Ranking

Features:

* Region Centroid Column: the column of the center pixel of the region
* Region Centroid Row: the row of the center pixel of the region
* Region Pixel Count: the number of pixels in a region, which is always nine
* Short Line Density Five: the results of a line extraction algorithm that counts how many lines of length five with low contrast, less than or equal to five, go through the region
* Short Line Density Two: same as Short Line Density Five but counts lines of high contrast, greater than five
* Vertical Edge Mean: measures the contrast of horizontally adjacent pixels in the region, used as a vertical edge detector
* Vertical Edge Standard Deviation: (see Vertical Edge Mean)
* Horizontal Edge Mean: measures the contrast of vertically adjacent pixels, used for horizontal line detection
* Horizontal Edge Standard Deviation: (see Horizontal Edge Mean)
* Intensity Mean: the average over the region of the sum of red, green, and blue values divided by three
* Raw Red Mean: the average over the region of the red value
* Raw Blue Mean: the average over the region of the blue value
* Raw Green Mean: the average over the region of the green value
* Excess Red Mean: measures the excess red, calculated as two times the red value minus the sum of green and blue values
* Excess Blue Mean: measures the excess blue, calculated as two times the blue value minus the sum of red and green values
* Excess Green Mean: measures the excess green, calculated as two times the green value minus the sum of red and blue values
* Value Mean: a three-dimensional nonlinear transformation of red, green, and blue values
* Saturation Mean: (see Value Mean)
* Hue Mean: (see Value Mean)

Scraped Data: Dataset Information

The instances were drawn randomly from a database of seven outdoor images. The images were hand-segmented to create a classification for every pixel. Each instance is a three-by-three region.
