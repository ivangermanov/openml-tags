Phishing Websites Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Phishing Websites dataset, generated with a seed of four. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its representative characteristics.

The dataset was subsampled to have a maximum of ten classes, one hundred columns, and two thousand rows. The subsampling process was stratified to ensure that the resulting dataset retained the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The dataset features include various characteristics of websites, such as the presence of IP addresses, URL length, and the use of shortening services. It also includes features related to website security, such as the presence of SSL certificates and domain registration length. Additionally, the dataset includes features related to website content, such as the presence of favicons, ports, and HTTPS tokens.

The dataset was generated using a Python script that utilized the NumPy and Pandas libraries. The script employed a random number generator to select the classes, columns, and rows to include in the subsampled dataset.
