The Solar Flare dataset has three target variables that correspond to the number of times three types of solar flare, namely common, moderate, and severe, are observed within a twenty-four hour period. There are two versions of this dataset, with one containing data from a specific year and the other from a different year. The dataset in question, referred to as SF2, contains data from a particular year. This multivariate regression dataset has a range of features, including the Zurich class, the size of the largest spot, the distribution of spots, the level of activity, the evolution of the activity, the activity of the previous day, the complexity of the history, whether the history became complex, the area, the area of the largest spot, the C class, the M class, and the X class.
