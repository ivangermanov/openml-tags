**Data Description**
This dataset contains drugs and their potency. The features of the drug are Fingerprint Molecular Descriptors which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

**Attribute Description**
1. Median PXc50 - target feature
2. Molecule ChEMBL ID - identifier

The dataset includes molecular fingerprints as features, which are a series of binary vectors that describe the molecular structure of the drugs. These features are used to predict the potency of the drugs.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug potency, Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System, Pipeline Pilot program.
