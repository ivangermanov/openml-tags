The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

These datasets include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function includes five features for input and is defined as y equals ten times sine of pi times x one times x two plus twenty times x three minus point five squared equals ten times X four plus five times X five plus e. 

To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 

These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 

Colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values are given below. 

The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, where only the first five features are related to the output and the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand. 

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with colinearity degree four, the numbers of features are generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. 

The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
