Game of Thrones Script All Seasons

This dataset has been generated through an intricate and time-consuming process. It begins with scraping entire URLs provided on Genius.com for the Game of Thrones series. The process of scraping and cleaning the dataset required an enormous amount of time and effort, during which I utilized a wide range of packages available for collecting and compiling data scattered all over the internet.

This dataset has been inspired by a previously published similar dataset, and I was awaiting its update to conduct some analysis. Unfortunately, it had been a long time since the last update, and therefore, following some of the practices employed, I generated this dataset, hoping it would be useful for anyone, or at least for my personal analysis.

The content within consists of a comprehensive set of Game of Thrones scripts for all seasons in the form of a table containing six columns with diverse data types used for various purposes. A detailed description of each column is provided in the data description section.

I would like to extend great credit to Genius.com for publishing the entire script of the Game of Thrones series completely. Additionally, kudos are due to all open-source packages and their contributors, allowing us to utilize these packages as we please.

There is only one question I aim to answer using this dataset: Who is the true hero or heroine in the entire series?
