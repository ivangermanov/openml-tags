Game of Thrones Script All Seasons

This dataset is generated through a long and complex process, starting from scraping the entire URLs provided on Genius.com for the Game of Thrones series. The process of scraping and cleaning the dataset required a significant amount of time and effort, in which I utilized a wide range of packages available for collecting and compiling data scattered all over the internet.

This dataset is inspired by a previous similar dataset published, in which I was waiting for an update to do some analysis. Unfortunately, it had been a long time since the last update, and therefore, following some of the same practices, I generated this dataset, and hopefully, it will be of good use for anyone or at least for my personal analysis.

The content inside is a complete set of Game of Thrones script for all seasons in the form of a table containing six columns with different data types used for various purposes. A description of each column is provided in the data description part.

Great credit is due to Genius.com for publishing the entire script of the Game of Thrones series completely. Also, kudos to all of the open-source packages out there, as well as the people who contribute to them, so we can utilize those packages as we please.

There is only one question that I want to find an answer to using this dataset: Who is the true hero or heroine in the whole series?
