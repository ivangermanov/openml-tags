Additional Information:

This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and has been widely utilized in statistics and machine learning. The dataset comprises three classes, each containing fifty instances, where each class corresponds to a specific type of iris plant. Notably, one class is linearly separable from the other two, whereas the latter two are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of the iris plant. This is an extremely simple domain.
