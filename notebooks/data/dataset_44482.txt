Amazon Commerce Reviews Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the original Amazon Commerce Reviews dataset, with a seed of four. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The dataset was generated using a Python function that takes in several parameters, including the seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratification flag. The function uses the NumPy random default generator to ensure reproducibility.

The subsampling process first selects a subset of classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the specified maximum. The selected classes are then used to filter the data, retaining only the rows that correspond to these classes.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns, selecting a subset of columns that does not exceed the specified maximum. The selected columns are then used to filter the data, retaining only the columns that correspond to these features.

Finally, the function stratifies the data, ensuring that the number of rows does not exceed the specified maximum. The stratification process involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, using the target variable to maintain the class balance.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, with a reduced number of rows, columns, and classes. The dataset is suitable for machine learning experiments, particularly those that require a smaller dataset size.
