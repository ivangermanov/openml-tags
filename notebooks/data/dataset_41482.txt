This is a pre-processed version of the Online Product Sales dataset, which was used in the Kaggle Online Product Sales competition. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a different product that is described by various product features as well as features of an advertising campaign. There are twelve target variables corresponding to the monthly sales for the first twelve months after the product launches. For the purposes of this study, we removed examples with missing values in any target variable and attributes with one distinct value. 

The dataset features include categorical and quantitative variables, such as product categories, dates, and quantities. These features provide a comprehensive description of the products and their advertising campaigns. 

The Online Product Sales dataset is a multivariate regression dataset, which makes it suitable for predicting multiple target variables simultaneously. This dataset is particularly useful for businesses that want to predict the sales of their products over a period of time.
