Visualizing Ethanol Dataset 

Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The resulting classes are represented as 'Positive' and 'Negative'. 

Features: Nitrogen Oxide Concentration, Carbon Concentration, Binary Class
