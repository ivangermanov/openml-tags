This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification system allows for easier analysis and comparison of the data. The features included in this dataset are State, Percentage of Population Over Sixty Five, Median Age, Per Capita Income, and Percentage of College Educated Individuals, as well as a Binary Class designation.
