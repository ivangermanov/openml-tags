PC1 Software Defect Prediction 

One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, this dataset contains data from flight software for Earth orbiting satellites. The data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code, which were defined in the seventies in an attempt to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Attribute Information 

The dataset consists of twenty-three attributes, including McCabe's line count of code, cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, design complexity, and Halstead measures such as total operators plus operands, volume, program length, difficulty, intelligence, effort, and others. It also includes counts of lines of code, comments, and blank lines, as well as unique operators, unique operands, total operators, and total operands. Additionally, the dataset contains the number of branches in the flow graph and whether each module has one or more reported defects.

Relevant Papers 

Several studies have used this dataset, including an analysis of data quality in the NASA Software Defect Datasets and assessments of predictors of software defects.
