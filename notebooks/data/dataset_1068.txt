This dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, containing information from flight software for an earth-orbiting satellite. The data is derived from McCabe and Halstead feature extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 1970s as an attempt to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes various metrics such as McCabe's line count of code, cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, design complexity, Halstead metrics (total operators and operands, volume, program length, difficulty, intelligence, effort, time estimator), line counts (code, comments, blank lines), unique operators and operands, total operators and operands, and branch count of the flow graph. The target variable indicates whether a module has one or more reported defects.

Relevant Papers:
Several studies have been conducted using this dataset, including analyses of data quality in NASA software defect datasets, evaluations of blind spot sampling policies in software engineering, and assessments of software defect predictors. These studies have contributed to the field of software quality assurance and defect prediction.

The PC1 Software Defect Prediction dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between various code metrics and the presence of software defects. It has been widely used in research to develop and evaluate predictive models for identifying potentially defective software modules. The dataset's inclusion of both structural and complexity metrics makes it a comprehensive resource for studying software quality and reliability.
