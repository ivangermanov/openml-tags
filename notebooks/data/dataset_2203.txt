QSAR-TID-11430 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11430. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015.

It is related to images, medicine, and MTLQSAR, and is a study on drug targets.

The target is the Dopamine D3 Receptor, also known as D(3) Dopamine Receptor or Drd3. It is a single protein and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, response to amphetamine, regulation of blood volume, and autophagy.

It is also associated with various diseases, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and addiction.

The dataset provides information on the relationship between the chemical structure of compounds and their activity on the Dopamine D3 Receptor.
