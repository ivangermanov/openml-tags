Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup Nine Upselling with a specified seed value. This dataset has been generated using the following source code.

The subsample function takes in several parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification or not. It first uniformly samples the classes, selecting a specified number of unique classes based on their frequency distribution. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples the columns, selecting a specified number of columns randomly. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data, ensuring that the class distribution is maintained.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string format and returns a new dataset object with the sampled data, column names, and categorical mask.

Features include various variables such as those related to customer demographics, transaction history, and product information. These features have been carefully selected to represent a diverse range of characteristics relevant to the upselling task.
