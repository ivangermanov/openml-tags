This dataset is one of several drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The datasets cover various aspects of drug design and molecular modeling, including melting point prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), and biodegradability prediction. They encompass a wide range of chemical compounds such as carbolenes, benzodiazepines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and protein inhibitors.

Many of the datasets are derived from published studies in medicinal chemistry and computational biology journals. They explore topics like molecular diversity, pharmacological evaluation, and the development of predictive models for biological activity and physicochemical properties.

The features in these datasets are typically molecular descriptors, which are numerical values that characterize the structure and properties of chemical compounds. These descriptors are used to build predictive models and analyze structure-activity relationships.

Some datasets focus on specific chemical classes or biological targets, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitors or haloalkane dehalogenase mutants. Others investigate broader concepts like toxicity prediction or the relationship between chemical structure and biodegradability.

The collection includes both regression and classification problems, with targets ranging from continuous values (e.g., melting points) to categorical outcomes (e.g., toxicity classifications).
