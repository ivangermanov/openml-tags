This dataset, named QSAR-TID-11780, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11780. It has fifty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M1, also known as Chrm1 or Chrm-one. It is a single protein preferred name, and its synonyms include Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M1. The organism associated with this receptor is Mus musculus, and it belongs to the species group.

This receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor. Its description relates to the asymmetric synapse, dendrite, plasma membrane, and presynaptic membrane.

The dataset also includes information about the expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process related to this receptor.

Keywords: QSAR, Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M1, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, membrane receptor, asymmetric synapse.
