This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Epoxide Hydratase, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identification, fingerprint bits, and median pseudo-pCI50.
