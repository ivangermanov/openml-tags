Subsampling of the dataset Albert with parameters generated using the following source code:

This function subsamples the dataset according to specified parameters. The function takes in several parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling.

First, the function selects a uniform sample of classes from the available classes in the dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, the function randomly selects the specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, the function randomly selects the specified number of columns.

Then, the function stratifies the sampling of rows according to the selected classes. This ensures that the sampled rows represent the distribution of classes in the original dataset.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset consisting of the subsampled data, along with metadata including the categorical mask and column names.

Features: Several numeric features have been omitted for brevity.
