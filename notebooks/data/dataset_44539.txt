Subsampling of the dataset Albert with a random seed, resulting in a dataset with a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to achieve the desired dataset size.

The subsampling function takes in several parameters, including the random seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. The function first samples classes uniformly, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, the function samples columns uniformly, selecting a specified number of columns randomly. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed, the function stratifies the sampling based on the target variable, ensuring that the sampled data maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset is a subset of the original Albert dataset, with a reduced number of rows, columns, and classes. The dataset includes a categorical mask, indicating which columns contain categorical variables, and a list of column names.
