Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This conversion was originally performed by an unnamed individual.

Features: height, length, area, eccentricity, percentage of black pixels, percentage of black and white pixels, mean of transitions, black pixels, black and white pixels, white to black transitions, binary class

This dataset represents a binarized adaptation of an original multi-class dataset. The transformation process involved converting the target feature from multiple classes to a binary classification. In this new format, the majority class is designated as positive ('P'), while all other classes are collectively labeled as negative ('N'). The dataset includes various features related to page block characteristics, such as dimensional attributes, pixel distributions, and transitional properties. These features are utilized to predict the binary classification of page blocks.
