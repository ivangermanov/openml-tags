Federal Election Dataset: General Description

The categorization of contributions from individuals is based on the amount contributed, with different thresholds applied over time. From 2015 to the present, the Federal Election Commission categorizes contributions as greater than two hundred dollars, using the calendar year-to-date amount for political action committee and party committee receipts, and the election-cycle-to-date amount for candidate receipts.

Prior to 2015, the threshold amounts were different. From 1989 to 2014, contributions of two hundred dollars and above were categorized, with the Commission using the reporting period amount to determine whether a contribution met the threshold. From 1975 to 1988, the threshold was even higher, with contributions of five hundred dollars and above being categorized, again using the reporting period amount.

The dataset includes information on various aspects of these contributions, including the committee identification, amendment indicator, report type, transaction primary general indicator, image number, transaction type, entity type, contributor name, city, state, zip code, employer, occupation, transaction date, transaction amount, and other identification numbers.
