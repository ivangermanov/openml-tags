QSAR-TID-11692 Dataset Description:

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11692. It has ninety-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.
