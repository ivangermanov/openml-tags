**Meta Album PlantNet Dataset (Extended)**

The Meta Album PlantNet dataset is created by sampling the Pl@ntNet-300k dataset, itself a sampling of the Pl@ntNet Project's repository. The images and labels that enter this database are sourced by citizen botanists from around the world, then confirmed using a weighted reliability score from other users, such that each image has been reviewed by an average of citizen botanists. Of the classes in the original Pl@ntNet-300k dataset, PLT_NET retains the most populous classes, belonging to genera, for a total of images, with a minimum and maximum image distribution per class. Each image contains a colored image of a plant or a piece of a plant from the corresponding class, scaled from the initial variable width using the INTER_AREA anti-aliasing filter from Open-CV. Almost all images were initially square; cropping by taking the largest possible square with center at the middle of the initial image was applied otherwise.
