**Meta Album PlantNet Dataset (Extended)**

The Meta Album PlantNet dataset is created by sampling the Pl@ntNet-300k dataset, itself a sampling of the Pl@ntNet Project's repository. The images and labels which enter this database are sourced by citizen botanists from around the world, then confirmed using a weighted reliability score from other users.

Of the numerous classes in the original Pl@ntNet-300k dataset, this dataset retains the most populous classes, belonging to various genera, for a total of many images. Each image contains a colored image of a plant or a piece of a plant from the corresponding class, scaled from the initial variable width using an anti-aliasing filter.

Almost all images were initially square; cropping by taking the largest possible square with center at the middle of the initial image was applied otherwise.
