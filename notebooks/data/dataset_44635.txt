Segment Seed Two N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

This is a subsampling of the dataset segment with a seed of two. The subsampling was done with the following arguments: the maximum number of rows is two thousand, the maximum number of columns is one hundred, the maximum number of classes is ten, and stratification is true.

The subsampling was generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes in the dataset. If there are more classes than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes using a random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is more than the maximum number of columns, it selects the maximum number of columns using a random choice.

Finally, the function stratifies the data accordingly. If the number of rows is more than the maximum number of rows, it uses train test split to get a subset of the data with the maximum number of rows, stratifying by the target name.

The resulting dataset has the same dataset name, but with the subsampled x, y, categorical mask, and columns.

Features: short line density, vertical edge mean, vertical edge standard deviation, horizontal edge mean, horizontal edge standard deviation, intensity mean, raw red mean, raw blue mean, raw green mean, excess red mean, excess blue mean, excess green mean, value mean, saturation mean, hue mean, class.

Keywords: dataset subsampling, stratification, random sampling, feature selection.
