STL-10 Tags: AzurePilot, Vision

The STL-10 dataset is a modification of the CIFAR-10 dataset, with some key differences. Each class has fewer labeled training examples than in CIFAR-10, but a very large set of unlabeled examples is provided to learn image models prior to supervised training. The primary challenge of this dataset is to make use of the unlabeled data, which comes from a similar but different distribution from the labeled data, to build a useful prior.

The dataset consists of ten classes: airplane, bird, car, cat, deer, dog, horse, monkey, ship, and truck. The images are in color and have a higher resolution of ninety-six by ninety-six pixels. There are multiple folds of training images, with a large set of test images per class. Additionally, there is a massive set of unlabeled images for unsupervised learning, which are extracted from a similar but broader distribution of images. For instance, it contains other types of animals and vehicles in addition to the ones in the labeled set. These images were acquired from labeled examples on ImageNet.

The dataset is designed to be a challenging benchmark for developing more scalable unsupervised learning methods, particularly with the higher resolution of the images.
