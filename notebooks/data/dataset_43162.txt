Height, which represents the perch height, is a two-level factor with levels High and Low, where High refers to perches greater than four point seven five feet and Low refers to perches lesser or equal to four point seven five feet. Diameter, which represents the perch diameter, is a two-level factor with levels Narrow and Wide, where Narrow refers to perches greater than four inches and Wide refers to perches lesser or equal to four inches.

Source
The dataset is sourced from various publications that focus on graphical modeling and the analysis of cross-classified categorical data.
