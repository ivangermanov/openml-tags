QSAR-TID-57 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, embryonic development, and tissue homeostasis. It is a nuclear receptor that binds to retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, and regulates gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences.
