Chennai Zomato Restaurants Data 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Context 
This dataset is a tribute to the rich food scene of my favorite city, entirely derived from web scraping the Zomato Chennai webpage. 

Content 
The data includes essential columns such as the price for two people, top selling dishes, and cuisines served by each restaurant. Additionally, it features Zomato-given ratings and the number of votes used to determine those ratings. Any fields that could not be scraped are marked as invalid.

Acknowledgments 
All of the data belongs exclusively to Zomato. I extend my gratitude to Zomato for their consistently helpful website. This data should be utilized solely for academic purposes.

Inspiration 
I am particularly interested in exploring how prices vary across different areas of Chennai and which cuisines are most popular in specific locations. Furthermore, I aim to investigate whether the data verifies the gentrification of certain areas in Chennai. These topics fascinate me, and I believe this dataset provides an excellent opportunity to delve into them.
