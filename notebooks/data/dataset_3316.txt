QSAR-TID-12476 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12476. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5, which is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is activated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter that is involved in many neurological processes.

The dataset provides a detailed description of the receptor, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The receptor is also associated with various gene ontology terms, including cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and neuron projection.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs that target the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5. The data can be used to develop predictive models that can identify potential drug candidates and optimize their activity.
