**Geographical Origin of Music**

**Data Description**

This dataset contains audio features extracted from one thousand and fifty-nine wave files. The task associated with the data is to predict the geographical origin of music. The dataset was built from a personal collection of tracks covering thirty-three countries or areas. The music used is traditional, ethnic, or world music only, as classified by the publishers of the product on which it appears. Any Western music is not included because its influence is global - what we seek are the aspects of music that most influence location. Thus, being able to specify a location with strong influence on the music is central.

The geographical location of origin was manually collected from the CD sleeve notes, and when this information was inadequate, we searched other information sources. The location data is limited in precision to the country of origin. The country of origin was determined by the artist's or artists' main country or area of residence. Any track that had ambiguous origin is not included. We have taken the position of each country's capital city or the province of the area by latitude and longitude as the absolute point of origin.

The program MARSYAS was used to extract audio features from the wave files. We used the default MARSYAS settings in single vector format to estimate the performance with basic timbral information covering the entire length of each track. No feature weighting or pre-filtering was applied. All features were transformed to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. We also investigated the utility of adding chromatic attributes. These describe the notes of the scale being used. This is especially important as a distinguishing feature in geographical ethnomusicology. The chromatic features provided by MARSYAS are especially important in distinguishing between different types of music.

**Attribute Description**

The dataset contains audio features of the track, and the origin of the music. The features are extracted from the wave files using the MARSYAS program. The last two columns are the origin of the music, represented by latitude and longitude.
