This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand thirty-seven, and it has seven hundred eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other features representing FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.

QSAR-TID-three thousand thirty-seven dataset contains information about a single protein preferred name map kinase signal integrating kinase two, also known as GPRK seven, Map kinase interacting serine threonine protein kinase two, Map kinase signal integrating kinase two, Mapk signal integrating kinase two, Mknk two.

Organism is Homo sapiens, species group is no protein target classification, and description relationship accession is map kinase interacting serine threonine protein kinase two single protein Q nine HBH nine.

There is also information about expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, Wikipedia, canSAR-target, guide to pharmacology, int act, pharm GKB, pharos, tchem, uniprot, inter pro, pfam, and pdbe.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, map kinase signal integrating kinase two, homo sapiens.
