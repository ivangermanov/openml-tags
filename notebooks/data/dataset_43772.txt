Context: People Love Movies Because

Movies have a unique ability to transport us to a different world, providing an escape from reality. As a vivid movie watcher, I have always been fascinated by how streaming services like Netflix and Hotstar seem to magically suggest the next movie I had been planning to watch. This sparked my curiosity, and I decided to embark on a project to create a similar system. To begin, I needed to extract a massive dataset of movies that people love to watch and apply analysis to it.

The dataset, Top-10000-Movies-Based-On-Ratings, contains the following information:

* Popularity: A measure of how well-liked a movie is.
* Vote Count: The number of people who have voted for a movie.
* Title: The name of the movie.
* Vote Average: The average rating given to a movie by its viewers.
* Overview: A brief summary of the movie's storyline.
* Release Date: The date when the movie was released.

Inspiration

I would love to uncover the answers to the following questions: What is the relationship between a movie's popularity and its average vote count? Which machine learning algorithm would be most effective in finding relationships between movies?
