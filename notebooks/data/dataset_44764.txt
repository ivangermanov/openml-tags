Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses a random number generator to select a specified number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The selection of classes is done using a stratified sampling approach, where the probability of selecting a class is proportional to its frequency in the original dataset. The selection of columns is done uniformly at random. If the number of rows in the resulting dataset is still larger than the specified maximum, the function uses a stratified train test split to further reduce the number of rows.

The resulting dataset has the same characteristics as the original dataset, but with a reduced number of classes, columns, and rows. The categorical mask is also updated to reflect the new column selection.
