QSAR-TID-101548 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101548. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Seprase is a single protein with multiple synonyms, including Antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme FAP, soluble form APCE, Dipeptidyl peptidase FAP, and FAP alpha. It belongs to the species group Mus musculus and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, and serine protease SC clan.

Seprase is primarily located in the extracellular region, extracellular space, plasma membrane, cell surface, and membrane. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, proteolysis, apoptotic process, cell adhesion, and regulation of collagen catabolic process.

Seprase exhibits multiple functions, such as protease binding, endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, integrin binding, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It also interacts with other proteins through identical protein binding and protein homodimerization activity.
