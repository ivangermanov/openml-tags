This dataset, named BNG (lymph), is tagged as artificial and BNG. It contains various features related to the lymphatic system and its components. These features include characteristics of lymphatics, blockages in the afferent lymphatic vessels, lymph cells, and the overall lymph system. The dataset also covers aspects such as bypass mechanisms, extravasation processes, and regeneration within the lymphatic system. It examines early uptake patterns, changes in lymph node size (both diminished and enlarged), and various alterations in lymph composition and node structure. Special forms of lymphatic abnormalities, node dislocations, and exclusions are also considered. The dataset includes information on the number of nodes involved in different conditions and provides a classification system for these lymphatic features and abnormalities.
