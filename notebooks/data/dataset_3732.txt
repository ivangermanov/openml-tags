Risk of Being Drawn into Online Sex Work Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset is the resulting cleaned version of the Risk of Being Drawn into Online Sex Work dataset.

Context:
This database was used in a research paper titled "Covert Online Ethnography and Machine Learning for Detecting Individuals at Risk of Being Drawn into Online Sex Work." The study focused on identifying individuals who may be vulnerable to engaging in online sex work.

Content:
The database comprises data scraped from a European online adult forum. Through covert online ethnography, researchers conducted interviews with a select group of participants to determine their likelihood of supplying or demanding sex services via the forum. This dataset is particularly suited for semi-supervised learning.

Acknowledgments:
The dataset was initially made publicly available.

Inspiration:
How can we identify individuals at risk of being drawn into online sex work? The proliferation of online social media has led to an increase in the number of people involved in online sex trade. However, detecting deviant behaviors online is hindered by the limited availability of data. To address this challenge, researchers combined covert online ethnography with semi-supervised learning using data from a popular European adult forum.
