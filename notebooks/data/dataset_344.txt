This is an artificial data set with complex dependencies between the attribute values. The cases are generated using a specific method, which involves the creation of ten attributes and one target variable.

The first attribute, X One, is uniformly distributed over the range from negative five to five. The second attribute, X Two, is uniformly distributed over the range from negative fifteen to negative ten. 

The third attribute, X Three, depends on the value of X One. If X One is greater than zero, then X Three is assigned the value "green". Otherwise, X Three is assigned the value "red" with a probability of point four, and "brown" with a probability of point six.

The fourth attribute, X Four, depends on the value of X Three. If X Three is equal to "green", then X Four is calculated as X One plus two times X Two. Otherwise, X Four is calculated as half of X One with a probability of point three, and half of X Two with a probability of point seven.

The fifth attribute, X Five, is uniformly distributed over the range from negative one to one. 

The sixth attribute, X Six, is calculated as X Four multiplied by a random error term, which is uniformly distributed over the range from zero to five.

The seventh attribute, X Seven, is a binary variable, taking the value "yes" with a probability of point three, and "no" with a probability of point seven.

The eighth attribute, X Eight, depends on the value of X Five. If X Five is less than point five, then X Eight is assigned the value "normal". Otherwise, X Eight is assigned the value "large".

The ninth attribute, X Nine, is uniformly distributed over the range from one hundred to five hundred. 

The tenth attribute, X Ten, is a uniformly distributed integer over the range from one thousand to twelve hundred.

The target variable, Y, is obtained using a complex set of rules, which depend on the values of X Two, X Four, X Seven, and X Eight.
