This is an artificial dataset with dependencies between attribute values. Cases are generated using a specific method involving multiple variables. The dataset includes uniformly distributed variables, conditional statements, and probabilistic assignments.

The method for generating cases involves several steps:

X is uniformly distributed over a specified range.
X is uniformly distributed over a different range.
X is conditionally assigned based on the value of X, with color options and associated probabilities.
X is conditionally calculated based on the value of X, using mathematical operations and probabilities.
X is uniformly distributed over a small range.
X is calculated as a product of X and a uniformly distributed variable.
X is assigned a binary value with associated probabilities.
X is conditionally assigned based on the value of X, with size options.
X is uniformly distributed over a larger range.
X is a uniformly distributed integer over a specified interval.

The target variable Y is obtained using a set of rules involving conditional statements and mathematical operations based on the values of other variables.

This dataset is part of a collection of regression datasets. It is designed for studying dependencies between attributes and exploring various regression techniques.

Features include multiple variables labeled x through x, as well as the target variable y.
