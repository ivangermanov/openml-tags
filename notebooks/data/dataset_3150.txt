QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a serine/threonine protein kinase, also known as SOK or Ste like kinase. This enzyme is classified as part of the STE protein kinase group, specifically in the STE protein kinase YSK subfamily. It is found in Homo sapiens and is associated with various cellular components including the cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and extracellular exosomes.

The protein has numerous functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and metal ion binding. It is involved in several biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, response to oxidative stress, establishment of cell polarity, signal transduction, axonogenesis, and Golgi localization.

This kinase plays a role in the positive regulation of stress activated MAPK cascade and is part of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to hydrogen peroxide. It also contributes to Golgi reassembly and the establishment of Golgi localization.

The protein has been studied extensively, with structural information available in the Protein Data Bank and additional data accessible through resources like ExpressionAtlas and Wikipedia. Its involvement in various cellular processes and stress responses makes it an important target for drug discovery and QSAR studies.
