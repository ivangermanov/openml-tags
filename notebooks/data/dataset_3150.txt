The QSAR-TID-101231 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101231. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The dataset is related to the single protein Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Twenty-Five, also known as Ste Twenty-Like Kinase, Ste Twenty/Oxidant Stress Response Kinase One. This enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, response to oxidative stress, establishment or maintenance of cell polarity, signal transduction, axonogenesis, phosphorylation, positive regulation of stress-activated MAPK cascade, intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to hydrogen peroxide, response to hydrogen peroxide, protein autophosphorylation, positive regulation of axonogenesis, Golgi localization, establishment of Golgi localization, and Golgi reassembly.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase, protein phosphorylation, oxidative stress, cell polarity, signal transduction.
