**Wave Energy**

**Data Description**
This dataset consists of positions and absorbed power outputs of wave energy converters in four real wave scenarios from the southern coast of Australia. The data is obtained from an optimization method with the goal of finding the optimal buoys placement. Each instance represents wave energy returns for different placements of sixteen buoys.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset includes the following attributes:

* Wave Energy Converters positions (x and y coordinates) ranging from zero to five hundred sixty-six meters
* Wave Energy Converters absorbed power (which should be ignored if total power output is considered as the target variable)
* Total power output of the farm, which is the target feature

**Dataset Information**
This dataset consists of positions and absorbed power outputs of wave energy converters in four real wave scenarios from the southern coast of Australia, including Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, and Tasmania. The applied converter model is a fully submerged three-tether converter. Sixteen wave energy converters locations are placed and optimized in a size-constrained environment. In terms of optimization, the problem is categorized as an expensive optimization problem, where each farm evaluation takes several minutes. The results are derived from several popular and successful evolutionary optimization methods.

**Additional Information**
The source code of the applied hydrodynamic simulator is available online. This work was supported with supercomputing resources provided by the Phoenix HPC service at the University of Adelaide.

**Has Missing Values?**
Yes

**Additional Variable Information**
The attributes have the following ranges:
* Wave Energy Converters position: continuous from zero to five hundred sixty-six meters
* Wave Energy Converters absorbed power
* Total power output of the farm
