The Small Business Administration (SBA) was founded in nineteen fifty-three to assist small businesses in obtaining loans. Small businesses have been the primary source of employment in the United States, and helping small businesses helps with job creation, which in turn reduces unemployment. Small business growth also promotes economic growth. One of the ways the SBA helps small businesses is by guaranteeing bank loans. This guarantee reduces the risk to banks and encourages them to lend to small businesses. If the loan defaults, the SBA covers the amount guaranteed, and the bank suffers a loss for the remaining balance.

There have been several small business success stories, such as FedEx and Apple. However, the rate of default is very high. Many economists believe the banking market works better without the assistance of the SBA. Supporters claim that the social benefits and job creation outweigh any financial costs to the government in defaulted loans.

The data set is from the US SBA loan database, which includes historical data with information on whether the loan was paid off in full or if the SBA had to charge off any amount and how much that amount was. The data set used is a subset of the original set, containing loans about the Real Estate and Rental and Leasing industry in California.
