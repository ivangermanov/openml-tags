The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

These datasets are one of the most widely used functions for generating data. They include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is a complex equation that involves sine, pi, and squared terms.

To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure an algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with varying collinearity degrees. Collinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets have varying parameters and values. The number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output. The remaining features are completely random. The number of samples also varies, ranging from one hundred to one thousand.

Collinearity degrees range from zero to four. For datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees.

In each file, the last attribute is the target.
