Name: Gina Subsampling of the Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Gina with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, arguments ncols max equal to one hundred, arguments nclasses max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to True.

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset. It takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes in the dataset. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is more than the maximum allowed, it selects a random subset of columns.

Finally, if the number of rows is more than the maximum allowed, it stratifies the dataset accordingly. It concatenates the data and target, splits it into a subset, and then separates the data and target again.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, target, categorical mask, and columns.
