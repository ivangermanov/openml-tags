QSAR-TID-11873 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Ten, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Ten. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Ten is a single protein, also known as MAP3K10, Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Ten, Mixed Lineage Kinase Two, MLK2, MST. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TKL protein kinase group/TKL protein kinase MLK family/TKL protein kinase MLK subfamily.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September two thousand fifteen.
