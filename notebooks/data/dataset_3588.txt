Insurance Premium Data 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

This dataset is something I stumbled upon online when I wanted to practice regression models. It is an openly available online dataset that can be found at multiple sources. Although I am unaware of the exact origin and collection methodology of the data, I highly recommend this dataset to everyone who is just starting their journey in data science.

The dataset boasts a range of informative features, including age, sex, body mass index, number of children, smoking habits, regional information, and insurance charges.
