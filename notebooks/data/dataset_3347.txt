QSAR-TID-260 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor, and it has eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor is a single protein, also known as Thyroliberin Receptor, and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. It is a neuropeptide receptor and is found in Homo sapiens.

The receptor has several synonyms, including Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor, TRHR, and TRH-R. It is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
