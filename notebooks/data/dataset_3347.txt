This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. The dataset is related to computer systems and MTLQSAR, and it belongs to the study three category.

The dataset contains information about the Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor, which is a single protein preferred name. It also has synonyms such as Thyroliberin Receptor and TRH-R. The receptor is classified under one membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR neuropeptide receptor.

The dataset provides information about the relationship between the receptor and other molecules, including the mechanism of action, maximum phase, and first approval. It also includes references to other databases such as DailyMed, PubMed, and KEGG.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also associated with various gene ontology terms, including plasma membrane, membrane, G protein-coupled receptor activity, thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor activity, and protein binding.
