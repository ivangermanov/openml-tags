QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC values. Features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Ephrin type B receptor, a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. This receptor is involved in various biological processes including angiogenesis, axon guidance, cell migration, and nervous system development. It functions in protein tyrosine kinase activity, ATP binding, and ephrin receptor signaling pathways.

The Ephrin type B receptor is associated with multiple cellular components such as the extracellular region, cytosol, plasma membrane, and cell projections. It plays roles in urogenital system development, corpus callosum formation, thymus development, and digestive tract morphogenesis.

This receptor is part of the EPH Ephrin signaling pathway and is involved in EPHB mediated forward signaling. It contains several protein domains including protein kinase, ephrin receptor ligand binding, and fibronectin type III domains. The receptor is also associated with various protein families and superfamilies related to tyrosine kinase activity and ephrin receptor functions.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship studies, potentially aiding in drug discovery efforts targeting the Ephrin type B receptor and related signaling pathways.
