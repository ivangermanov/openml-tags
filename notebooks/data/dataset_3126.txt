QSAR-TID-100416 Tags: Health, Medicine, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred forty-six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred forty-six. The dataset has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
