Background

When is my university campus gym least crowded, so I know when to work out? We measured how many people were in this gym once every ten minutes over the last year. We want to be able to predict how crowded the gym will be in the future.

Goals

Given a time of day (and maybe some other features, including weather), predict how crowded the gym will be. Figure out which features are actually important, which are redundant, and what features could be added to make the predictions more accurate.

Data

The dataset consists of people counts (about every ten minutes) over the last year. In addition, I gathered extra information including weather and semester-specific information that might affect how crowded it is. The label is the number of people, which I'd like to predict given some subset of the features.

Label: Number of People

Features: Date, Time Stamp, Day of the Week, Is Weekend, Is Holiday, Temperature, Is Start of Semester, Month, Hour
