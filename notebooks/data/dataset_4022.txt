QSAR-TID-10625 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10625. It has forty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes various features, namely Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many others representing the molecular fingerprints.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10625.

The drug target, also known as the serotonin five-a receptor, is a single protein and its preferred name is serotonin five-a receptor. It also has synonyms such as five-HT-five, five-HT-five-A, five-hydroxytryptamine receptor five-A, and many others.

This receptor is found in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, chemical synaptic transmission, and many others.
