Dota 2 Games Results Data Set
Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

Dota 2 is a highly popular computer game where two teams, each consisting of five players, compete against each other. At the beginning of the game, each player selects a unique hero with distinct strengths and weaknesses.

The dataset is relatively sparse since only ten out of one hundred thirteen possible heroes are chosen in a given game. All games were played within a span of two hours on a specific date.

The data was collected using a web link.

Attribute Information:
Each row of the dataset represents a single game, featuring the following attributes in the specified order:

* The team that won the game
* Cluster identification related to location
* Game mode, such as All Pick
* Game type, such as Ranked

Subsequent attributes consist of indicators for each hero. A value of one signifies that a player from team one played as that hero, whereas a negative one indicates the opposing team. It is essential to note that each hero can only be selected by one player per game, resulting in each row having five ones and five negative ones.
