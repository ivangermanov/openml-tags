Abstract:
The dataset contains oceanographic and surface meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys positioned throughout the equatorial Pacific. The data is expected to aid in the understanding and prediction of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles.

Data Characteristics:
This data was collected with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array which was developed by the international Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program. The TAO array consists of nearly 70 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific, measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection, understanding and prediction of seasonal to interannual climate variations originating in the tropics, most notably those related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles.

The moorings were developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). Each mooring measures air temperature, relative humidity, surface winds, sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters. A few of the buoys measure currents, rainfall and solar radiation.

The data consists of the following variables: date, latitude, longitude, zonal winds (west<0, east>0), meridional winds (south<0, north>0), relative humidity, air temperature, sea surface temperature and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters. Data was taken from the buoys from as early as 1980 for some locations.

Variable Characteristics:
The latitude and longitude in the data showed that the buoys moved around to different locations. The latitude values stayed within a degree from the approximate location, while the longitude values were sometimes as far as five degrees off of the approximate location. Looking at the wind data, both the zonal and meridional winds fluctuated between -10 m/s and 10 m/s. The plot of the two wind variables showed no linear relationship.

The relative humidity values in the tropical Pacific were typically between 70% and 90%. Both the air temperature and the sea surface temperature fluctuated between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius. The plot of the two temperature variables shows a positive linear relationship existing. The two temperatures when each plotted against time also have similar plot designs.

There are missing values in the data. Not all buoys are able to measure currents, rainfall, and solar radiation, so these values are missing dependent on the individual buoy. The amount of data available is also dependent on the buoy, as certain buoys were commissioned earlier than others. All readings were taken at the same time of day.

Background:
The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of 1982-1983, the strongest of the century, created many problems throughout the world. Parts of the world such as Peru and the United States experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western Pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires. The ENSO cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak. This highlighted the need for an ocean observing system (i.e. the TAO array) to support studies of large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions on seasonal to interannual time scales.

The TAO array provides real-time data to climate researchers, weather prediction centers and scientists around the world. Forecasts for tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the ENSO cycle data. These forecasts are possible because of the moored buoys, along with drifting buoys, volunteer ship temperature probes, and sea level measurements.

Research Questions:
Research questions of interest include:
- How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world?
- How do the variables relate to each other?
- Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations?
- Does the amount of movement of the buoy affect the reliability of the data?

When performing an analysis of the data, one should pay attention to the possible effect of autocorrelation. Using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today's weather.
