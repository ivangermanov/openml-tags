The Fri C Three One Hundred Fifty Dataset has been binarized into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

This dataset contains numerous features including various ozone measurements. The resulting binary class feature enables more straightforward analysis and comparison.
