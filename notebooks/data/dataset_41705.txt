ASP-POTASSCO Classification Tags: Algorithm Selection, R

This dataset was generated for a publication about Claspfolio 2.0, an algorithm selector for Answer Set Programming (ASP). The algorithm portfolio of Clasp configuration is generated by the Hydra method in combination with Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC).

To generate the features, I used Claspre, a lightweight version of the ASP solver Clasp, with static and dynamic features. The features include instance identification, repetition, fraction of negative body, fraction of positive body, fraction of unary rules, fraction of binary rules, fraction of ternary rules, fraction of integrity rules, tightness, problem variables, free problem variables, assigned problem variables, constraints, variables in constraints, created bodies, program atoms, strongly connected components, nodes in positive binary and/or graphs, rules, normal rules, cardinality rules, choice rules, weight rules, and various other features related to equivalences, constraints, conflicts, and learning.

The dataset includes features that are related to the performance of the ASP solver Clasp, such as conflict levels, learned binary and ternary constraints, skipped levels while backjumping, and running averages of conflict levels and learned binary and ternary constraints.
