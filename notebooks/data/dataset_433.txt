This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies cover a wide range of topics in medicinal chemistry and drug design, including:

- Carbolenes
- Melting point prediction and classification of solid drugs
- Neighborhood behavior for validation of molecular diversity descriptors 
- General melting point prediction using diverse compound datasets and artificial neural networks
- Synthesis and evaluation of substituted imidazopyridazines as benzodiazepine receptor ligands
- QSAR analysis of various compound classes including phenethylamines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and PDGFR inhibitors
- Structure-activity relationships for toxicity and biodegradability of anilines and phenols
- Acute toxicity modeling of halogenated aliphatic compounds
- Biodegradability prediction for chlorinated dioxins and furans
- Mechanism-based modeling of dehalogenation reactions
- Structure-function and structure-stability relationships of modified proteins
- Stability modeling of aromatic amide-bromide complexes
- Antifilarial activity modeling of antimycin analogues

The datasets utilize various molecular descriptors and statistical methods to develop predictive models for properties like melting point, toxicity, biodegradability, and biological activity. Multiple QSAR approaches are employed, including Hansch analysis, holistic invariant descriptors, and multivariate pattern recognition techniques.
