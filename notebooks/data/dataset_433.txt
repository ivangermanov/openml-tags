The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from a specific source. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". This dataset is one of the most widely used functions for data generation.

Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is a complex mathematical equation that involves sine, pi, and squared terms. 

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. The collinearity degree refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters are varied to test different scenarios. The number of features ranges from a small set to a large set. The number of samples also varies greatly. 

Collinearity degrees range from zero to four, indicating an increasing level of dependence among features. For the datasets with a high collinearity degree, the number of features is also increased.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying these three parameters. Each dataset has a unique combination of feature number, sample number, and collinearity degree.
