The codrna dataset, tagged as "Author" and "Source," originates from the libSVM site. This dataset focuses on the detection of non-coding RNAs based on predicted secondary structure formation free energy change. The study associated with this dataset was published in BMC Bioinformatics.

The dataset underwent preprocessing, which included joining test, train, and rest datasets. Each file was then normalized columnwise according to specific rules:

- Constant features (columns with only one value) were set to zero and subsequently removed due to sparsity.
- Binary features (columns with two values) were adjusted so that the more frequent value was set to zero and the less frequent to one.
- Multinary or real features (columns with more than two values) were divided by their standard deviation.

It's important to note that the codrna dataset contains many duplicated data points, both within individual files (train, test, rest) and across these files. These duplicated points were not removed during preprocessing.

The features included in the dataset are Y, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, and X.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers studying RNA secondary structures and their role in non-coding RNA detection. The preprocessing steps applied to the data aim to enhance its usability for machine learning applications, particularly in the field of bioinformatics.
