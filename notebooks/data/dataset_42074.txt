Wine Reviews

Tags: Wine

The Wine Reviews dataset consists of wine data gathered from the web. This dataset was scraped from Wine Enthusiast Magazine during a specific week in June. The code used for the web scraping process can be found online.

The dataset features a range of information about wine, including the country of origin, a detailed description, the wine's designation, the points awarded to the wine, its price, the province where it was produced, the region where it was made, the specific variety of grape used, and the winery responsible for its production.
