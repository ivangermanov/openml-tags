Machine Learning and Mathematics Subsampling of the Dataset KDD Cup Nine Appetency

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original KDD Cup Nine Appetency dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset.

The subsampling function takes several arguments, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. In this case, the function was called with a seed value of zero, a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, ten classes, and stratification enabled.

The function first selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the specified maximum. It then selects the corresponding indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the resulting dataset, selecting a specified number of columns without replacement. Finally, it stratifies the sampling of rows based on the target variable, ensuring that the resulting dataset has the specified number of rows.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, which include various variables such as Var Six, Var Eleven, Var Twenty Two, and so on. The dataset also includes the appetency target variable.
