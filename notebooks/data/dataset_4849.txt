The Thyroid Disease Records Dataset is a collection of data related to computational universe and computer systems. This dataset was supplied by the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia.

The dataset consists of various features that describe the characteristics of patients with thyroid disease. These features include the patient's age, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, total thyroxine level, free thyroxine index, sex, and whether they were taking thyroxine medication.

Additionally, the dataset includes information about the patient's medical history, such as whether they had undergone thyroid surgery, received I131 treatment, or had a diagnosis of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. It also notes if the patient was pregnant, had a goiter, or a tumor, as well as any psychological issues.

Other relevant information included in the dataset is whether the patient's T3 levels were measured, their referral source, and their class.
