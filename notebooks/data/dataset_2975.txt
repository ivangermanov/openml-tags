Traffic Violations

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset contains traffic violation information from all electronic traffic violations issued in the County. To maintain privacy, any information that could be used to uniquely identify the vehicle, the vehicle owner, or the officer issuing the violation has been omitted.

For this version, certain features were removed and all remaining character features were recoded as nominal factor variables. Additionally, all punctuation characters were removed from factor levels.

The variable "Violation Type" is used as the target by default. To simplify the analysis, the smaller target categories "Safety Equipment Repair Order" and "Emergency Safety Equipment Repair Order" were combined into one category labeled "Safety Equipment Repair Order".

To reduce the complexity of the dataset, it was downsized to a representative sample. Unused factor levels and nearly constant features were also dropped.

The dataset includes the following features:

* Description
* Whether seat belts were worn
* Whether there was personal injury
* Whether there was property damage
* Whether the driver had a commercial license
* Whether the vehicle was commercial
* The state where the violation occurred
* The type of vehicle involved
* The year of the vehicle
* The make of the vehicle
* The model of the vehicle
* The color of the vehicle
* The charge filed against the driver
* Whether the driver contributed to the accident
* The race of the driver
* The gender of the driver
* The city where the driver resides
* The state where the driver resides
* The state where the driver's license was issued
* The type of arrest made
* The type of violation committed
