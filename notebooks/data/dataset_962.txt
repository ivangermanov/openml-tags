Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

This dataset represents a morphological feature set that has been binarized from its original multi-class format. The conversion process involved transforming the target feature into a binary classification, where the majority class is labeled as positive and all other classes are grouped as negative. This modification allows for simplified binary analysis and classification tasks.

The dataset is part of a collection of studies related to mythbusting and various research topics. It is important for researchers using this data to properly cite the source and acknowledge the modifications made to the original dataset.

Features included in this dataset are morphological attributes that have been numerically encoded. These features provide quantitative representations of shape and structure-related characteristics, which can be utilized for pattern recognition and classification tasks in various domains.
