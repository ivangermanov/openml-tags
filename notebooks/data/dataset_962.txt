The MFEAT-Morphological dataset has been binarized from its original form. This process involved converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the majority class was relabeled as positive, denoted by 'P', while all other classes were relabeled as negative, denoted by 'N'. 

This dataset falls under the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and UCI. 

Features included in this dataset are attribute one, attribute two, attribute three, attribute four, attribute five, attribute six, and binary class.
