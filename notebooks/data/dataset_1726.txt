The QSAR-TID-140 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 140. This dataset has 176 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

This dataset is related to economics and life science, specifically focusing on the prostanoid FP receptor, also known as the prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor. It belongs to the group of single proteins and is classified under the species group of Homo sapiens.

The prostanoid FP receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also associated with positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, parturition, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, and response to estradiol.

Some of the molecules associated with this receptor include Tafluprost, Dinoprostone, Latanoprostene Bunod, Travoprost, and Sepetaprost. These molecules have been approved for use in various indications, including glaucoma and pulmonary hypertension.
