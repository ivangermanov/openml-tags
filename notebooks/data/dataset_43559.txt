Moonrise Moonset Phases Timings UK 2005 2017

Tags: This dataset contains moonrise, moonset, and lunar phase timings for every date from the year two thousand and five to two thousand and seventeen for London, United Kingdom; collected from timeanddate.

Inspiration

This data can be used to study the effects of the lunar cycle on any other event of interest. One interesting application for which I created it is to find the correlation of full moon timings with road accidents, to test the Lunar Lunacy effect! I am eager to see what other creative uses it can have?

Note: Since only one city can be chosen to retrieve results from the source, hence I had to use London in the United Kingdom as the geographical location. It is noteworthy that moonrise and moonset times will differ for different locations in the United Kingdom, despite being in the same time zone, due to differences in solar time (in simple words, differences in horizon level). Yet these differences in timings will still be lesser than thirty minutes (as per observing the contrast between that of eastern and western locations of the United Kingdom). So if precise timing is not required, then these timings can be used to account for the entire United Kingdom. And technically, the primary Moon phases occur at a specific moment in time, so phase timings will always be the same for every location throughout the United Kingdom.
