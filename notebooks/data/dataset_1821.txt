This dataset, named QSAR-TID-20166, belongs to the categories of Life Science, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR, and is part of the study three. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dating back to September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values of various compounds on the drug target TID: 20166. It comprises five hundred sixty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, along with numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, ranging from FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero to FCFP six one hundred twenty-four nine hundred ninety-eight.

Scraped data reveals that the ID is ChEMBL five zero seven six, classified as a single protein, with its preferred name being the Histamine H three receptor. Its synonyms include H three R, HH three R, Histamine H three receptor, and HRH three. The organism associated with this receptor is Cavia porcellus, belonging to the species group of no protein target classification. It falls under the category of one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, family A GPCR, monoamine receptor, and histamine receptor.

Description and relationship accession information for the Histamine H three receptor is also available. Furthermore, GO component annotations include plasma membrane and membrane, while GO function annotations encompass G protein-coupled receptor activity and histamine receptor activity. Additionally, GO process annotations involve regulation of neurotransmitter levels, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

canSAR-target information includes accession number Q nine JI thirty-five, whereas UniProt accessions consist of Q nine JI thirty-five and Q nine JI thirty-six. InterPro accessions comprise IPR zero zero zero two seven six, IPR zero zero three nine eight zero, IPR zero one seven four five two, and IPR zero four one nine nine eight. Lastly, Pfam accession includes PF zero zero zero zero one, corresponding to seven tm one.
