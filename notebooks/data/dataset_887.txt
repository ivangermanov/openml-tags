Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on MBA program admissions and student performance. It has been processed to create a binary classification problem from the original numeric data. The conversion was done by calculating the mean value of the target variable and assigning positive ('P') labels to instances below the mean and negative ('N') labels to those above. This binarization allows for simplified analysis and modeling of the data.

The dataset includes information on applicants' characteristics and test scores, which can be used to predict their likelihood of success in an MBA program. By transforming the continuous outcome into a binary classification, researchers can more easily apply certain machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques.

Features included in the dataset are sex and GMAT scores, along with the newly created binary class label. These variables provide a basis for analyzing factors that may influence MBA program performance and admissions decisions.
