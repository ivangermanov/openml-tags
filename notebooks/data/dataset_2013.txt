QSAR-TID-101465 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101465. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Demographics
The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was created in September 2015. It is a single protein dataset, and its preferred name is Serine/threonine-protein kinase LATS1. It also has synonyms such as h-warts and Large tumor suppressor homolog 1. The organism is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group.

Description
Serine/threonine-protein kinase LATS1 is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. It is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, protein phosphorylation, and hormone-mediated signaling pathways. It also regulates the activity of other proteins, including kinases and transcription factors.

Expression Atlas
The expression atlas shows that Serine/threonine-protein kinase LATS1 is expressed in various tissues, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and microtubule organizing center.

Go Component
