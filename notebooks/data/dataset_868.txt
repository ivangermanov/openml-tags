This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes various features, which are essential for analysis.

The binary class feature is also included in the dataset, which categorizes instances into Positive or Negative classes.
