Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: [Omitted due to unreadability]

This dataset represents a binarized adaptation of an original dataset, transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this computed mean. Instances falling below the mean are designated as positive, while those above are classified as negative. This binary classification approach simplifies the original dataset's structure, potentially facilitating certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that are better suited to categorical outcomes.

The dataset's origin and creation date remain unknown, highlighting the importance of proper documentation and attribution in data science. Researchers and practitioners utilizing this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, acknowledging its derivative nature from the original source.

While the specific features of the dataset are not clearly readable, the binary classification target provides a clear focus for potential analyses or predictive modeling efforts. This type of data transformation can be particularly useful in scenarios where the goal is to predict membership in one of two distinct categories, rather than estimating a continuous value.
