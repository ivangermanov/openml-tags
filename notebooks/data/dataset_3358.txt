QSAR-TID-146 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 146. The dataset has 683 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Glucagon Receptor, which is a single protein target that plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is involved in various physiological processes, including glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and drug discovery. It provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.
