Phishing Websites Seed Two Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Phishing Websites dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its overall structure.

The dataset has been stratified to ensure that the sampled classes are representative of the original distribution. This involved selecting a fixed number of classes based on their frequency in the original dataset and then sampling the corresponding instances.

The column selection process involved uniformly choosing a subset of columns from the original dataset. This was done to reduce the feature space while retaining the most informative features.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of instances and features from the original Phishing Websites dataset. It has been carefully constructed to preserve the underlying relationships between the variables while reducing its size and complexity.
