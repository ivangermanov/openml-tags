The Titanic dataset is a machine learning dataset related to computer systems. This particular version of the dataset is a derived version of the original, specifically the PMLB version, which utilizes a reduced set of three key features. For those interested in exploring the full scope of the data, a more comprehensive version, referred to as version one, is available and can be accessed through this online resource: https://www.openml.org/d/.

The three primary features incorporated into this dataset are the passenger's class, age, and sex, all of which are crucial factors in understanding the dynamics at play.
