QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Urotensin II receptor, also known as Urotensin receptor or UTSR. This is a single protein target found in Felis catus (domestic cat). It is classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein coupled receptor category, specifically a peptide receptor and short peptide receptor within the neuropeptide receptor subcategory.

The Urotensin II receptor is associated with several cellular components, including the plasma membrane and general membrane structures. Its functions include urotensin II receptor activity and G protein coupled receptor activity. The receptor is involved in various biological processes such as signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, regulation of blood pressure, and blood vessel diameter maintenance.

This target is referenced in multiple databases including canSAR Target, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. The InterPro entries highlight its classification as a G protein coupled receptor of the rhodopsin like family, specifically a urotensin II receptor. The Pfam database categorizes it under the tm family.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies, particularly in the context of drug discovery and development targeting the Urotensin II receptor. The molecular fingerprints included in the dataset allow for detailed analysis of compound structures and their relationship to biological activity.
