QSAR-TID-11629 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11629. The dataset has a total of 688 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase I Gamma 2. Casein Kinase I Gamma 2 is a single protein, also known as CK1G2 or CKI-gamma 2, and is a member of the CK1 protein kinase group and CK1 protein kinase family. It is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and Wnt signaling pathway.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and prediction of drug-target interactions. The dataset is available for download and can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and drug discovery.
