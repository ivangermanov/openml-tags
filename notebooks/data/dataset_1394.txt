QSAR-TID-12162 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3, Text & Literature

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12162. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset has one hundred eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature molecule chembl id and median px fifty.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12162. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for machine learning and cheminformatics applications.
