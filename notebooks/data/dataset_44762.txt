Subsampling of the dataset Kick with Seed Four 

Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset has been subsampled from the original Kick dataset, which had forty-one thousand one hundred sixty-two entries. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The uniform sampling of classes ensured that the resulting dataset had an equal representation of all classes. This was achieved by selecting a specified number of classes randomly, with the probability of selection based on their frequency in the original dataset.

Once the classes were selected, the corresponding entries were extracted from the original dataset. Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. This involved randomly selecting a specified number of columns from the available ones.

The resulting dataset has undergone stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution remains consistent throughout. This was achieved using a stratified split approach, which takes into account the class labels during sampling.

The dataset features include purchase date, auction information, vehicle details, transmission type, wheel type, odometer reading, nationality, size, top American name, market research acquisition prices, current retail prices, prime unit information, auction guarantee, buyer number, zip code, vehicle cost, online sale indicator, warranty cost, and bad buy indicator.
