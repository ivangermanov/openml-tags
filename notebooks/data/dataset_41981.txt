SAT Eleven Hand Runtime Classification Dataset

This dataset is classified under Algorithm Selection, Computer Systems, and Education. It is sourced from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/SATzilla/.

The data does not distinguish between timeout, memory out, or crashes; the status file will only have 'ok' or 'timeout'. If features are unknown, the instance was solved during feature computation. Although there is no necessary alignment and dependencies between the feature processing steps, the steps were executed in a fixed alignment. Therefore, all feature steps depend on the previous executed ones.

Features include:

* Number of Original Variables
* Number of Original Clauses
* Number of Variables
* Number of Clauses
* Reduced Variables
* Reduced Clauses
* Variable-Clause Ratio
* Positive-Negative Ratio Clause Mean
* Variable-Clause Graph Clause Mean
* Unary
* Binary Probability
* Trinary Probability
* Variable-Clause Graph Variable Mean
* Positive-Negative Ratio Variable Mean
* Horn Clause Fraction
* Variable Graph Mean
* Cluster Coefficient Mean
* Diameter Mean
* Cluster Number Mean
* Cluster Size Mean
* Search Process Bias Mean
* Search Process Unconstrained Mean
* Satisfiability Approximation Procedure Best Solution Mean
