SAT11-HAND-runtime-classification Dataset

Tags: Algorithm Selection

This dataset is related to the field of Algorithm Selection, which involves selecting the best algorithm for a given problem instance. The dataset is specifically designed for runtime classification, which aims to predict the runtime of an algorithm on a given instance.

The dataset does not distinguish between timeout, memory out, or crashes, and the status file will only have two possible outcomes: "ok" or "timeout". If features are unknown or cannot be computed, they are represented as "?".

The features in this dataset are computed in a fixed order, and each feature depends on the previous ones. The features are categorized into several groups, including:

* Instance characteristics, such as the number of variables and clauses, and their ratios.
* Clause features, including the mean, coefficient of variation, minimum, maximum, and entropy of clause variables.
* Variable features, including the mean, coefficient of variation, minimum, maximum, and entropy of variable values.
* Graph-based features, including the diameter, cluster coefficient, and vertex degree.
* Search-based features, including the best solution mean, coefficient of variation, and first local minimum step.
* Other features, including the bias and unconstraint measures.
