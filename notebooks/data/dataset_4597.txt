The MFEAT Factors dataset has been subsampled with specific parameters to create a new dataset. This dataset has been tagged with Chemistry and Machine Learning.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset until the desired number of classes was reached. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to select the corresponding data points.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled until the desired number of columns was reached. The selected columns were then used to create the new dataset.

If the resulting dataset still had too many rows, stratified sampling was used to reduce the number of rows while maintaining the class balance. This was done using the train-test split function from scikit-learn.

Finally, the categorical columns were converted to strings to conform to OpenML standards.

Features include attributes forty-two, forty-six, fifty-one, and so on.
