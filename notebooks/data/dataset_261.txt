This dataset, known as BNG (Pendigits), is an artificial dataset created for study purposes. It contains multiple input features, labeled from one to sixteen, along with a class feature. The dataset is designed to simulate handwritten digit recognition, with each input potentially representing various aspects of pen movement or digit formation. The artificial nature of the dataset allows for controlled experimentation and analysis in machine learning and pattern recognition studies.
