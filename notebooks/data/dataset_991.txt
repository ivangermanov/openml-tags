Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: buying, maintenance, doors, persons, luggage boot, safety, binary class

This dataset focuses on car evaluation and classification. It has been derived from an original multi-class dataset and transformed into a binary classification problem. The transformation process involved relabeling the majority class as positive and grouping all other classes as negative. This binarization allows for simplified analysis and modeling of car attributes and their relationship to a binary outcome. The features included cover various aspects of car evaluation, including purchase cost, maintenance requirements, passenger capacity, storage space, and safety ratings. Researchers and data scientists can use this dataset for mythbusting studies and to explore relationships between car characteristics and overall classification.
