QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Beta-secretase (BACE), also known as Aspartyl protease, ASP, BACE. It is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Aspartic protease/Aspartic protease AA clan/Aspartic protease AA subfamily. The target is a single protein found in Homo sapiens.

Several compounds targeting Beta-secretase are included, such as atabecestat, verubecestat, lanabecestat, and elenbecestat. These are small molecule Beta-secretase inhibitors in various phases of development.

The protein is associated with multiple cellular components including lysosomes, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, synaptic vesicles, and neuronal structures. Its functions include amyloid-beta binding, endopeptidase activity, and protein binding. It is involved in processes such as proteolysis, amyloid precursor protein catabolism, and amyloid-beta formation.

Beta-secretase plays a role in various biological pathways and is the subject of extensive research due to its potential involvement in Alzheimer's disease. The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure-activity relationship studies targeting this enzyme.
