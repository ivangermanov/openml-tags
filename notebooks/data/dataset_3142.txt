This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Beta Secretase One, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. 

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identifiers and molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling.

Beta Secretase One is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the production of amyloid beta peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

The QSAR models developed from this dataset can be used to identify potential inhibitors of Beta Secretase One, which could be useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Keywords: QSAR, Beta Secretase One, Alzheimer's disease, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot, MetaQSAR project, enzyme, amyloid beta peptides.
