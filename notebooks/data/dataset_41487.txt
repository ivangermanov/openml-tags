This dataset is a pre-processed version of the See Click Predict Fix competition dataset, which was used in a Kaggle competition. It concerns the prediction of three target variables that represent the number of views, clicks, and comments that a specific three-one-one issue will receive. The issues have been collected from four cities in the United States, namely Oakland, Richmond, New Haven, and Chicago, and span a period of twelve months. The version of the dataset that we use here is a random one percent sample of the data.

In terms of features, we use the number of days that an issue stayed online, the source from where the issue was created, such as Android or iPhone, the type of the issue, such as graffiti or pothole, the geographical coordinates of the issue, the city it was published from, and the distance from the city center. All multi-valued nominal variables were first transformed to binary and then rare binary variables, being true for less than one percent of the cases, were removed.

Keywords: multivariate regression, See Click Predict Fix, three-one-one issues, city data, prediction.
