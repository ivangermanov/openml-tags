The NYC Taxi Green December 2016 dataset is used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on categorical and numerical features" benchmark. 

The original dataset is the Trip Record Data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. The dataset includes TLC trips of the green line in December. The data was downloaded from the commission's website. For a description of all variables in the dataset, please refer to the commission's homepage. 

The variable "tip amount" was chosen as the target variable. The variable "total amount" is ignored by default, otherwise the target could be predicted deterministically. The date variables "pickup datetime" and "dropoff datetime" could be used to compute additional time features. 

In this version, we chose only trips with "credit card" as the payment type, as tips are not included for most other payment types. We also removed the variables "trip distance" and "fare amount" to increase the importance of the categorical features "pickup location ID" and "dropoff location ID". 

The dataset features include vendor information, store and forward flag, rate code ID, passenger count, extra charges, MTA tax, tolls amount, improvement surcharge, trip type, and tip amount.
