Click Prediction Small Seed Two Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Click Prediction Small Dataset with Seed Equal to Two

This dataset is a subsample of the Click Prediction Small dataset. It was generated using a specific source code that involves random sampling of classes, columns, and rows. The subsampling process ensures that the dataset is stratified, meaning that the sample is representative of the original dataset.

The dataset was created by first uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded a certain maximum, the classes were selected based on their frequency in the original dataset. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to subset the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If the number of columns exceeded a certain maximum, a specified number of columns were randomly selected. The dataset was then subset to include only these selected columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were sampled. If the number of rows exceeded a certain maximum, a stratified sample of rows was taken. This ensured that the sample was representative of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including impression, URL hash, ad ID, advertiser ID, depth, position, query ID, keyword ID, title ID, description ID, and user ID. The dataset also includes a click feature.
