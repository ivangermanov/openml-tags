Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Eucalyptus with seed equals two arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes and columns. If the number of classes exceeds the maximum, it selects the top classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the required number of rows. The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
