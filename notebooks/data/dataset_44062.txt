Brazilian Houses 

Tags: Computer Systems, Physical Sciences 

This dataset belongs to the regression on categorical and numerical features benchmark. It contains information about houses to rent, featuring thirteen distinct characteristics.

Original Description: 
This dataset contains houses to rent with various attributes. Please note that some values in the dataset can be considered outliers for further analysis. It is essential to bear in mind that the web crawler was used solely to gather the data; hence, it is possible that errors in the original data exist.

Changes in Data Between Versions of Dataset 
Since the web crawler was run on different days for each version of the dataset, there may be differences, such as added or deleted houses (as well as added cities).

Notes: 
This dataset corresponds to the second version of the original dataset. The value representing an absence of floors was replaced by zero, as it refers to houses with only one floor.

Features include city, area, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, parking spaces, permission for animals, furnishing, homeowners association fee, rent amount, property tax, fire insurance, and total cost.
