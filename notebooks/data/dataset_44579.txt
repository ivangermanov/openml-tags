The Diabetes One Thirty US dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of parameters to create a new dataset. This process involves selecting a random subset of the original data while ensuring that certain conditions are met.

The subsampling process begins by uniformly selecting classes from the unique values present in the target variable. In cases where there are more classes than the specified maximum, a random selection is made based on the value counts of each class. The indices corresponding to the selected classes are then used to filter the data.

Next, the columns are sampled uniformly if their number exceeds the specified maximum. This is done by randomly choosing column indices and sorting them to maintain their original order.

Finally, the number of rows is reduced to the specified maximum if necessary. To ensure that the resulting dataset remains representative, stratified sampling is employed according to the target variable.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, including demographic information, medical history, and treatment details. These features are crucial in understanding the complexities of diabetes management and predicting patient outcomes.
