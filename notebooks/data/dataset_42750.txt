Census-Income-KDD
Tags: Chemistry, Machine Learning

This dataset contains information about individuals and their incomes. The features include demographic information, employment status, education level, and other factors that might influence income.

The dataset includes features such as age, class of worker, industry code, occupation code, level of education, wage per hour, enrollment in educational institutions, marital status, major industry code, major occupation code, race, Hispanic origin, sex, membership in a labor union, reason for unemployment, full- or part-time employment status, capital gains, capital losses, dividends from stocks, tax filer status, region of previous residence, state of previous residence, detailed household and family status, detailed household summary, migration code changes, number of persons working for an employer, family members under eighteen, country of birth, citizenship, ownership of a business or self-employment, filling of a questionnaire for veterans administration, veterans benefits, weeks worked in a year, and year of survey.

The dataset also includes an income feature, which indicates whether the individual's income is less than or equal to fifty thousand dollars.

This dataset is useful for machine learning and data mining applications, particularly those focused on predicting income based on demographic and employment characteristics.

HTRU2

Pulsars are a rare type of neutron star that produce radio emission detectable on earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter. As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, producing a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. This pattern repeats periodically, allowing scientists to identify pulsars.

However, distinguishing between real pulsars and false positives caused by radio frequency interference and noise is challenging. Machine learning tools are being used to automatically label pulsar candidates, treating the problem as a binary classification issue. Legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, while spurious examples are a majority negative class.

The HTRU2 dataset contains sixteen thousand two hundred fifty-nine spurious examples and one thousand six hundred thirty-nine real pulsar examples, all verified by human annotators. The data is presented in two formats: comma-separated values and attribute-relation file format.

Each candidate is described by eight continuous variables and a single class variable. The variables are derived from the integrated pulse profile and the dispersion-measure-signal-to-noise ratio curve. They include mean, standard deviation, excess kurtosis, and skewness of the integrated profile and the dispersion-measure-signal-to-noise ratio curve.
