This version has feature names based on https://www2.1010data.com/documentationcenter/beta/Tutorials/MachineLearningExamples/CensusIncomeDataSet.html. Missing data is also properly encoded in this version. The feature 'unknown' in the dataset does not appear in the list above. This possibly refers to the feature 'instance weight' in the original UCI description.

Dataset Information:

HTRU2 is a dataset that describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter. As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus, pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes. Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation. Thus, a potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional information, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However, in practice, almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find. Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems, in particular, are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. Here, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present, multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation. The dataset shared here contains spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. The data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF. Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are zero (negative) and one (positive). Please note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool.

Has Missing Values? No

Additional Variable Information:

Each candidate is described by eight continuous variables, and a single class variable. The first four are simple statistics obtained from the integrated pulse profile. This is an array of continuous variables that describe a longitude-resolved version of the signal that has been averaged in both time and frequency. The remaining four variables are similarly obtained from the DM-SNR curve. These are summarized below:

* Mean of the integrated profile
* Standard deviation of the integrated profile
* Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile
* Skewness of the integrated profile
* Mean of the DM-SNR curve
* Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve
* Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve
* Skewness of the DM-SNR curve
* Class

HTRU2 Summary:

The dataset contains a total of seventeen thousand eight hundred ninety-eight examples, with one thousand six hundred thirty-nine positive examples and sixteen thousand two hundred fifty-nine negative examples.
