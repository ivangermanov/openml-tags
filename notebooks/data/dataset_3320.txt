Dataset Information 
The dataset was acquired and annotated by professional physicians at Hospital Universitario de Caracas. The subjective judgments were originally done in an ordinal manner and were discretized in two classes. Images were randomly sampled from the original colposcopic sequences. The original images and the manual segmentations are included in the images directory. The dataset has three modalities. The target variables are expert assessments and consensus.
