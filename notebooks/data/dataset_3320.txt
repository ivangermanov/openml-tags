QSAR-TID-186 Tags: Computer Systems, Human Activities, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tetanus Toxin, and it has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint zero, six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint one, six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint two, and so on up to nine hundred twenty-six.
