QSAR-TID-186 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tetanus Toxin, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tetanus Toxin. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features were generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The Tetanus Toxin is a single protein with multiple synonyms, including Tentoxylysin, Tetanus toxin, Tetanus toxin chain H, and Tetanus toxin chain L. It is an organism from Clostridium tetani, and its protein target classification is a single protein.

The Tetanus Toxin has multiple GO components, including extracellular region, cytosol, plasma membrane, endocytic vesicle membrane, and clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane. It also has multiple GO functions, including metalloendopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, protein transmembrane transporter activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.

The Tetanus Toxin is involved in multiple biological processes, including proteolysis, modulation of process of another organism, negative regulation of neurotransmitter secretion, and protein transmembrane transport.
