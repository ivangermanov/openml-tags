QSAR-TID-12013 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12013. The dataset has two hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Caspase-6, which is a single protein and a cysteine protease. Caspase-6 is involved in the apoptotic process and is a key player in the execution phase of apoptosis. It is also involved in the regulation of programmed cell death and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the activity of various compounds on Caspase-6, which can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases related to this protein. The dataset can also be used to identify new compounds that can modulate the activity of Caspase-6, which can be useful for the development of new drugs.
