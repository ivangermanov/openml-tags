QSAR-TID-12013 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12013. The dataset has two hundred rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The features do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains molecule ChEMBL ID, and numerous FCFP six one thousand twenty-four features.

This dataset was generated from ChEMBL version seventeen and is part of the MetaQSAR project. It was released in September two thousand fifteen.

Caspace Six is a single protein, also known as Apoptotic Protease Mch-two, CASP Six, Caspace Six Subunit p ten. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, cysteine protease, cysteine protease CD clan, and cysteine protease C fourteen family.

Expression Atlas shows that Caspace Six is expressed in various tissues. Gene Ontology annotations indicate that Caspace Six is involved in numerous biological processes, including activation of innate immune response, proteolysis, apoptotic process, and positive regulation of apoptotic process. It also participates in various cellular components, such as nucleus, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, cytosol, and caspase complex.
