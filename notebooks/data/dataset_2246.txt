QSAR-TID-12536 Tags: Chemistry, MTLQSAR, Physical Sciences, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: One Two Five Three Six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX50. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, Molecular Fingerprint One, Molecular Fingerprint Two, Molecular Fingerprint Three, and so forth.
