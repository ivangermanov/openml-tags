Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three

The QSAR dataset, named QSAR-TID-10778, contains activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10778. It consists of eighty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule ChEMBL IDs and class feature: median pXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Death Associated Protein Kinase Two. Death Associated Protein Kinase Two is a single protein that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group and the CAMK protein kinase DAPK family. It is primarily located in the nucleus, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, cytoplasmic vesicle, and autophagosome lumen. 

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, regulation of autophagy, phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of apoptotic process, anoikis, protein autophosphorylation, positive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis, and positive regulation of eosinophil chemotaxis. 

It also participates in several molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and identical protein binding.
