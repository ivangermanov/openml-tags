GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets specifically designed for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets enable the estimation of various quality metrics, including accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from the growing need in the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a standardized collection of microarray classification problems. This allows researchers to compare and evaluate different classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available Expression Project for Oncology (expO) repository maintained by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of expO and its consortium supporters is to collect tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The resulting tumor data is updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions.

The decision to utilize data from the expO repository was driven by several key factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of a single microarray platform for all samples, and the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies. Furthermore, the expO repository offers a vast number of samples for various tumor types.

When publishing materials based on GEMLeR datasets, users are requested to acknowledge the assistance received by using this repository. This facilitates the replication of experiments and enables others to access the same datasets.

Features include gene identifiers and expression values.
