QSAR-TID-102401 Dataset: Machine Learning, Mathematics, MTLQSAR Study 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 102401. It consists of seventy-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and other molecular fingerprint features.
