QSAR-TID-30040 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30040. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30040. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the target protein, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. The target protein is a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, and apoptotic process.

The dataset also contains information about the expression of the target protein in different tissues and cells, including its expression in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and postsynaptic density. The target protein is also involved in various biological processes, including learning, memory, and locomotory behavior.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, serine/threonine-protein kinase, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, DNA-templated transcription, learning, memory, locomotory behavior.
