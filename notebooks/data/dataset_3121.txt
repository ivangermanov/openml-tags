QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Metabotropic glutamate receptor, also known as Gprcb Grm, mGluR, or Mglur. This receptor is found in Rattus norvegicus and belongs to the Membrane receptor/Family C G protein coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family C GPCR)/Neurotransmitter receptor (family C GPCR)/Metabotropic glutamate receptor classification.

The receptor is associated with various cellular components, including the plasma membrane, axon, dendrite, presynaptic membrane, cell projection, neuron projection, synapse, astrocyte projection, presynapse, and glutamatergic synapse. Its functions include group II metabotropic glutamate receptor activity, G protein coupled receptor activity, calcium channel regulator activity, and protein binding.

The receptor is involved in numerous biological processes, such as cell communication, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, adenylate cyclase inhibiting G protein coupled glutamate receptor signaling pathway, glutamate secretion regulation, dopamine secretion regulation, behavioral response to nicotine, response to cocaine, regulation of synaptic transmission, long term synaptic depression, and intracellular glutamate homeostasis.

Cross references for this target include canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro. The receptor is associated with various protein families and domains, including GPCR mtglu rcpt, ANF lig bd rcpt, GPCR Cys dom, and Peripla BP I.
