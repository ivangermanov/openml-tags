**Dollar Stock Prices and Infos**
Tags: **Computer Systems**, **Machine Learning**

To build an Artificial Intelligence to predict the stock price of the US Dollar currency on IBOVESPA, I had to create this dataset. All information collected here is from a standard graphic for stock prices.

The data is organized by prices and information per minute. Each row contains: date, open price, maximum value, minimum value, close price, volume, financial transactions, number of negotiations, Moving Median Exponential thirteen, Moving Median Exponential seventy-two, High Mean, Low Mean, difference between MACD, DEA MACD, MACD Long Hour, difference Long Hour, DEA Long Hour, and target. 

The target column is the price fifteen minutes in the future. 

This data is intended to construct an Artificial Intelligence to predict the price in fifteen minutes. We want to buy if the predicted price is above our goal per trade and sell if the prediction is below our goal.
