Dollar Stock Prices and Infos Tags: Context

To build an Artificial Intelligence to predict the stock price of the Dollar currency on IBOVESPA, I had to create this dataset. All information collected here is from a standard graphic for stock prices.

The data is organized by prices and information per minute. Each row contains date, open price, maximum value, minimum value, close price, volume, financial, negotiations, moving median thirteen, moving median seventy-two, high mean, low mean, difference MACD, DEA MACD, MACD long and short, difference long and short, DEA long and short, and target. The target column is the price fifteen minutes in the future.

This data is here to construct an Artificial Intelligence to predict the price in fifteen minutes. We want to buy if the predicted price is above our goal per trade and sell if the prediction is below our goal.
