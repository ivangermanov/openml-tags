This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes features such as oxygen-based variables, which are important for understanding chemistry and life science concepts. This dataset is particularly useful for regression problems, mythbusting, and various studies. By converting the numeric target feature into a binary class, this dataset enables researchers to explore complex relationships between variables.
