The RSCTC 2010 Six Dataset is a collection of DNA microarray data analysis and classification examples, featuring six distinct problems. Each dataset contains gene expression data characterized by a large number of attributes, ranging from twenty thousand to sixty-five thousand. The samples in each dataset are assigned to multiple classes, varying between two and ten.

All attributes in the dataset are numeric and represent measurements taken from DNA microarrays. This dataset provides an opportunity to explore the complex relationships between gene expressions and their corresponding classifications.

Features include various variables, such as Var One, Var Two, Var Three, and so on, up to Var One Hundred. However, due to the sheer number of features, they have been omitted from this description for brevity.

This dataset is part of the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge, which aims to provide example datasets for researchers to develop and test their DNA microarray data analysis techniques.
