Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with target values below the mean were classified as positive, denoted by 'P', while those above the mean were classified as negative, denoted by 'N'. This binarization technique allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression task, potentially offering new insights or approaches to analyzing the data.

The dataset includes several features, labeled as oz one through oz ten, suggesting they may represent different measurements or attributes related to the problem domain. The final feature, binary Class, likely represents the binarized target variable resulting from the aforementioned transformation process.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately and refer to the original version for additional context or information that may have been lost in the binarization process.
