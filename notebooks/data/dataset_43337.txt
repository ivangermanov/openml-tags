The Consumer Credit Department of a Bank Wants to Automate the Decision-Making Process for Approval of Home Equity Lines of Credit.

To achieve this goal, they will follow the recommendations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to create an empirically derived and statistically sound credit scoring model. This model will be based on data collected from recent applicants who have been granted credit through the current process of loan underwriting.

The model will be built using predictive modeling tools, but the created model must be sufficiently interpretable to provide a reason for any adverse actions, which include rejections.

The Home Equity Dataset contains baseline and loan performance information for a large number of recent home equity loans. The target variable indicates whether an applicant eventually defaulted or was seriously delinquent.

For each applicant, a range of input variables were recorded, including details about the loan itself, the applicant's employment history, and their credit history.
