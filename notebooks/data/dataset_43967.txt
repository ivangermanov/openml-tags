This dataset is used in the tabular data benchmark and has been transformed in the same way. It belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

The dataset was retrieved from the LibSVM repository and has undergone significant preprocessing. Initially, the dataset was loaded without scaling. Then, each column was normalized according to specific rules. Columns containing only one value were set to zero and removed due to sparsity. Columns with two values had the most frequent value set to zero, and the other value set to one. Columns with more than two values were divided by their standard deviation. Finally, duplicate lines were removed.

The dataset was originally multiclass, but it has been transformed into a binary class dataset. The features have been transformed to ensure they are suitable for machine learning models.
