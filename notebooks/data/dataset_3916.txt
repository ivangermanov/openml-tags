This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand one, and it has seven hundred seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand one. This dataset has seven hundred seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Since generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated, there was no need for imputation in this case.
