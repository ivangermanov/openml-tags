QSAR-TID-30001 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30001. The dataset has a total of seven hundred seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase two protein, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including microtubule cytoskeleton organization, neuron migration, and protein phosphorylation.

The protein is involved in several biological processes, including autophagy of mitochondrion, Wnt signaling pathway, and establishment of cell polarity. It is also associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
