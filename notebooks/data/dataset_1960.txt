This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10436 and tagged with Demographics, MTLQSAR, and study_3, contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 10436.

The dataset has one hundred forty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. These features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-six FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. When using this dataset, please cite the source accordingly.

The drug target associated with this dataset is Papain, also known as allergen Car p one, Papain, Papaya proteinase one, and PPI. It belongs to the species group Carica papaya and is classified as an enzyme, protease, cysteine protease, cysteine protease CA clan, and cysteine protease C one A family.

Papain is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, and has functions related to protein binding, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and serpin family protein binding. 

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, Papain, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR project, proteolysis.
