The Colon Dataset 

Tags: Geography, Microarray 

This dataset contains broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays. It provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying colon cancer development and progression.

Features: 

The dataset includes a comprehensive set of attributes, including but not limited to, various genetic markers, gene expressions, and other relevant biological parameters.
