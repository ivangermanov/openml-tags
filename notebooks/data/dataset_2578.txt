Diabetes Dataset 

Ten Baseline Variables 

The Diabetes dataset contains ten baseline variables, including age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, which were obtained for each of the diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Data Set Characteristics 

The dataset consists of a number of instances and attributes. The number of instances refers to the total number of data points, while the number of attributes refers to the characteristics or features of each instance. In this case, there are ten numeric predictive values, and the target is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Attribute Information 

The ten attribute variables include age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. These variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times the number of samples, resulting in each column totaling one when summed.
