QSAR-TID-12587 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12587. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Cathepsin L two protein, which is a type of enzyme involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, immune response, and apoptosis. The protein is also known as Cathepsin U or Cathepsin V and is classified as a cysteine protease.

The dataset is part of the Expression Atlas, which provides information on gene expression across different tissues and cell types. The dataset is also linked to various other databases, including GoComponent, GoFunction, and GoProcess, which provide information on gene ontology, protein function, and biological processes.
