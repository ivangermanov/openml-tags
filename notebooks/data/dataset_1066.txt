This dataset is part of the PROMISE Software Engineering Repository, made publicly available to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and improvable predictive models of software engineering. Users publishing material based on PROMISE datasets should follow the acknowledgment guidelines posted on the PROMISE repository web page.

The dataset contains class level data for KC1, including a true/false attribute to indicate defectiveness. It was originally created and donated for use in investigating the effect of module size on defect prediction using static measures. The study utilized various machine learning algorithms to predict defective modules in several NASA products, including CM1, JM1, KC1, KC2, and PC1.

The research observed that a large portion of the modules were small, as measured by lines of code. Experiments on data subsets partitioned by module size yielded higher prediction performance for subsets including larger modules. Additionally, using class level data for KC1 resulted in improved prediction performance compared to method level data. These findings suggest that quality assurance activities can be better guided by using defect predictions based on data from larger modules.

The dataset includes numerous features at the class level, such as percentage of public data, access to public data, coupling between objects, depth, lack of cohesion of methods, number of children, dependency on child, fan in, response for class, and weighted methods per class. It also contains features transformed from method level to class level, including various metrics related to lines of code, complexity, and Halstead metrics.

These transformed features are represented by minimum, maximum, sum, and average values across all methods in a class. Examples include blank lines, branch count, code and comment lines, cyclomatic complexity, design complexity, essential complexity, executable lines of code, and various Halstead metrics such as content, difficulty, effort, error estimates, length, level, programming time, and volume.

The dataset aims to provide comprehensive information for software defect prediction and analysis, enabling researchers and practitioners to develop and improve models for software quality assurance.
