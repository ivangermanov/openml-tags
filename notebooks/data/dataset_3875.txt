QSAR-TID-188 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ErbB-2, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ErbB-2, which is a single protein and a preferred name for CD340, ERBB2, HER2, Metastatic Lymph Node Gene 19 Protein, MLN19, and other synonyms. It is a protein target classification of enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/tyrosine protein kinase EGFR family.

The dataset also includes information about the protein target classification, which is a receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ErbB-2, and its relationship with other proteins, such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and ErbB-2, and its mechanism of action as a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase ErbB-2 inhibitor.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about the protein's expression, including its component, function, and process, such as nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, endosome, and plasma membrane. It also includes information about its binding, including its binding to ATP, growth factor, and protein.

The dataset also includes information about the protein's role in various biological processes, such as signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.
