This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK1, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four, and many more.
