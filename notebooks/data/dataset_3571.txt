QSAR-TID-10919 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK1, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK1. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK1 is a single protein preferred name with synonyms JAK1, JAK-1, JAK1A, JAK1B, and Janus Kinase 1. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase JakB family. The protein target classification is one enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase JakB family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September two thousand fifteen.
