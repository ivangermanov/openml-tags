QSAR-TID-10876 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10876. The dataset has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10876. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is related to protein kinase C delta, a single protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, cell growth, and cell survival. The protein is involved in the regulation of various downstream targets, including other proteins, lipids, and ions.

The dataset is also related to various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and immune response. The protein kinase C delta is a key player in these processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
