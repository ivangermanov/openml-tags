Data Description 

This is the historical price data of the Foreign Exchange Australian Dollar/Swiss Franc currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one daily candlestick. The entire dataset covers a date range from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Foreign Exchange market is not active on these days. The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam.

The class attribute is the direction of the mean of the Close Bid and the Close Ask of the following day, relative to the Close Bid and Close Ask mean of the current day. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean Close price is increasing the following day, and false when the mean Close price is decreasing or remains the same the following day.
