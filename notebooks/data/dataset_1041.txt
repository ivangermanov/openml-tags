GINA is a digit recognition database. The task of GINA is handwritten digit recognition. The data type is non sparse. The number of features is seven hundred and eighty four. The dataset contains examples and a check sum.

Features include various pixels, such as pixel one, pixel two, pixel three, and so on, up to pixel seven hundred and eighty four. These pixels represent the visual information used for recognizing handwritten digits.

GINA is part of a challenge that explores the balance between agnostic learning approaches and those that utilize prior knowledge. This dataset provides a platform for researchers to develop and test algorithms for handwritten digit recognition, a fundamental task in computer vision and machine learning.

The conversion to ARFF format by TunedIT enhances the dataset's compatibility with various machine learning tools and frameworks, making it more accessible for researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition.
