**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Three.**

This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete medium model.

The Barley Bayesian Network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of one hundred fourteen thousand and five parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, while the average degree is approximately three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

This preliminary model was developed for barley under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". 

Features include type kernel varieties, kernel variety, and area under disease pressure, among others.
