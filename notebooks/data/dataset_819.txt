Delta Elevators Dataset 

Tags: Binarized Regression Problem, Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes several relevant features, including Climb Rate, Altitude, Roll Rate, Current Roll, Difference in Climb Rate, and Difference in Difference in Climb Rate. These features are used to predict the binary class, which is either Positive or Negative.
