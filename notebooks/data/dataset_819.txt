Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

The Delta Elevators dataset focuses on elevator control systems and their performance metrics. It includes various features that describe the elevator's behavior and environmental conditions. These features encompass measurements such as climb rate, altitude, roll rate, current roll, and differences in climb rates. The dataset has been specifically processed to create a binary classification problem, making it suitable for machine learning tasks that involve predicting one of two possible outcomes.

This binarized version of the dataset offers researchers and data scientists an opportunity to explore classification algorithms and their effectiveness in predicting elevator system behavior. By transforming the original continuous target variable into a binary outcome, the dataset enables the application of a wide range of classification techniques and facilitates the evaluation of model performance in a simplified, yet meaningful context.

The Delta Elevators dataset serves as a valuable resource for studies in areas such as control systems, aviation, and machine learning. Its transformation into a binary classification problem makes it particularly useful for testing and comparing different classification algorithms, as well as for educational purposes in teaching machine learning concepts.
