This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero three five two one, and it has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and numerous FCFP six one zero two four bits, ranging from FCFP six one zero two four zero to FCFP six one zero two four nine hundred twenty-five.

Scraped data includes information about the Bradykinin B-one receptor, also known as the B-one bradykinin receptor, B-one R, BDKRB, and BK-one receptor. It is a single protein preferred name, with synonyms including B-one bradykinin receptor, B-one R, BDKRB, and BK-one receptor.

The Bradykinin B-one receptor is an organism classified under Mus musculus, with a species group of no protein target classification. It belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor family A GPCR, and short peptide receptor family A GPCR.

Description relationships and accession include B-one bradykinin receptor single protein Q-six one one two five. Rows per page include fifty-one to one of one expression atlas, with Q-six one one two five go component, including plasma membrane, membrane, and other components.

Go function includes G protein-coupled receptor activity, bradykinin receptor activity, and peptide binding. Go process includes negative regulation of protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of leukocyte migration, inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and other processes.

Guide to pharmacology includes forty-one reactome, with peptide ligand-binding receptors, G alpha q signalling events, and G alpha i signalling events. UniProt includes Q-six one one two five and Q-nine Z-one F-four interpro, with IPR-zero zero zero two seven six, IPR-zero zero zero four nine six, IPR-zero zero one one eight six, and IPR-zero one seven four five two pfam, with PF-zero zero zero zero one.
