The QSAR-TID-30048 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30048. This dataset has eighty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

This dataset contains information about a single protein, which is also known as Serine Threonine Protein Kinase thirty-eight Like. It has synonyms such as NDR two, NDR two GN, NDR two protein kinase, Nuclear Dbf two related kinase two, and Serine Threonine Protein Kinase thirty-eight Like.

The dataset is related to the species Homo sapiens and belongs to the enzyme kinase protein kinase AGC protein kinase group AGC protein kinase NDR family classification.

The description of this protein includes its relationship with accession, where it is classified as a single protein with accession number Q nine Y two H one. There is also information available about its expression atlas, go components, go functions, and go processes.

Some of the go components include cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, actin cytoskeleton, membrane, and glutamatergic synapse. Its go functions include nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, actin binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding.

Some of the go processes include protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of autophagy, phosphorylation, peptidyl serine phosphorylation, intracellular signal transduction, regulation of cellular component organization, and postsynapse organization.
