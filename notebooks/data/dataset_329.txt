The Hayes-Roth Database is a merged version of separate train and test sets typically distributed. On OpenML, this train-test split can be found as one of the possible tasks. The dataset originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This database contains numeric-valued attributes, with only a subset used during testing. Furthermore, only two of the three concepts are utilized during testing (those with the prototypes zero and one-one-one). All values have been mapped to their zero-indexing equivalents. Some instances could be placed in either category zero or one, and following the authors' suggestion, they have been placed in each category with equal probability.

The actual values of the attributes (e.g., hobby having values chess, sports, and stamps) have been replaced with numeric values. This approach may be considered unfair, as while human subjects could apply background knowledge to the attribute values and their relationships, algorithms were not provided with such knowledge.

It is unclear whether the two distractor attributes (name and hobby) are presented to the algorithms during testing. However, it is evident that only the age, educational status, and marital status attributes are given during the human subjects' transfer tests.

The dataset includes the following attributes:

- Name: distinct for each instance and represented numerically
- Hobby: nominal values ranging between one and three
- Age: nominal values ranging between one and four
- Educational level: nominal values ranging between one and four
- Marital status: nominal values ranging between one and four
- Class: nominal value between one and three

The classification rules are as follows:

- Class Neither: if a four occurs for any attribute C-E
- Class One: Otherwise, if the number of ones is greater than the number of twos for attributes C-E
- Class Two: Otherwise, if the number of twos is greater than the number of ones for attributes C-E
- Either One or Two: Otherwise, if the number of twos equals the number of ones for attributes C-E

Prototypes for each class are defined as:

- Class One: one-one-one
- Class Two: two-two-two
- Class Either: three-three-three
- Class Neither: four-four-four

The dataset does not contain any missing values.
