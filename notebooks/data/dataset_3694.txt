This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10466, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10466.

The preferred name for this target is Cholecystokinin A receptor, and it also has synonyms such as CCK one R, Cckar, CCK AR, CCK A receptor, and Cholecystokinin one receptor.

This receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. It is specifically a cholecystokinin receptor.

The expression atlas for this receptor includes information about its role in various biological processes such as temperature homeostasis, gastric acid secretion, neuron migration, reduction of food intake in response to dietary excess, signal transduction, and many others.
