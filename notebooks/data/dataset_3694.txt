QSAR-TID-10466 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10466. The dataset has seventy-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10466. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Cholecystokinin A receptor, which is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor family.

The Cholecystokinin A receptor is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including temperature homeostasis, gastric acid secretion, neuron migration, and feeding behavior. It is also involved in the regulation of hormone secretion, calcium ion transport, and potassium ion transport.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting the Cholecystokinin A receptor. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization, among other applications.
