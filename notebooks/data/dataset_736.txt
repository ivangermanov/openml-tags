Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on visualizing environmental factors and their relationships. It has been processed to create a binary classification problem from the original numeric data. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether they fall below or above this threshold, respectively.

The dataset includes several environmental variables that may be used to predict or analyze the binary classification outcome. These features include measurements of ozone levels, radiation intensity, and temperature. The binary class serves as the target variable for classification tasks.

This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for studies involving environmental data analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning applications that require categorical outcomes. It provides a simplified representation of complex environmental relationships, allowing for more straightforward interpretation and modeling.
