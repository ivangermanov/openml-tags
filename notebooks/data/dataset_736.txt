Visualizing Environmental Dataset 

Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting One, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as negative, denoted by 'N'. This dataset includes features such as Ozone Levels, Solar Radiation, and Temperature readings. The binary classification system allows for a more simplified approach to understanding the environmental data.
