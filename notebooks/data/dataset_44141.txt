Brazilian Houses 

Tags: Astronomy, Machine Learning 

Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset contains houses to rent with different features. Please note that some values in the dataset can be considered as outliers for further analyses. It is also important to bear in mind that the web crawler was used only to get the data, so it is possible that errors in the original data exist.

There may be differences in the data between versions of the dataset, such as added or deleted houses, as well as added cities, since the web crawler was run on different days for each version of the dataset.

This dataset corresponds to the second version of the original dataset. The value 'none' in the attribute floor was replaced by zero as it refers to houses with just one floor.

The dataset includes features such as area, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, parking spaces, homeowners association fees, rent amount, property tax, fire insurance, and total cost in Brazilian Reals.
