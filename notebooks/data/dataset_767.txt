Name: Analcatdata Apnea

Tags: Mythbusting, Study

Source: Unknown - Date unknown

Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Scorer One, Scorer Two, Subject, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Apnea, is a modified version of an original dataset from an unknown source. The modification process involved binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset is associated with mythbusting and various studies, though specific details about these associations are not provided. The features included in the dataset are Scorer One, Scorer Two, Subject, and Binary Class, which suggest that the data may be related to sleep apnea studies or similar medical research involving multiple scorers and subjects.
