The Bus Breakdown and Delay System collects information from school bus vendors operating out in the field in real-time. When bus staff encounter delays during their route, they are instructed to radio the dispatcher at the bus vendor's central office. The bus vendor staff then log into the Bus Breakdown and Delay System to record the event and notify the Office of Pupil Transportation (OPT). OPT customer service agents use this system to inform parents who call with questions regarding bus service.

The Bus Breakdown and Delay System is publicly accessible and contains real-time updates. All information in the system is entered by school bus vendor staff. Historical data is available for review.
