Popular Movies of IMDb

TMDB.org is a crowd-sourced movie information database widely used by various film-related consoles, sites, and apps, such as XBMC, MythTV, and Plex. Dozens of media managers, mobile apps, and social sites utilize its API. At the time of writing, TMDB lists a substantial number of films, which is considerably fewer than IMDb. While not as comprehensive as IMDb, it holds extensive information for most popular and Hollywood films.

This dataset comprises the most popular movies across the world, fetched through the read API. TMDB's free API allows developers and their teams to programmatically fetch and use TMDB's data, provided they attribute TMDB as the source of the data and/or images. Additionally, they update their API periodically.

This dataset is fetched using an exception handling process, resulting in some null values due to missing fields in the TMDB database. Although it may present a challenge, it is an excellent opportunity for young analysts to deal with missing values.
