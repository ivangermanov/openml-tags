The Movie Database, abbreviated as TMDB, is a crowd-sourced repository of movie information utilized by numerous film-related consoles, websites, and applications, including XBMC, MythTV, and Plex. Dozens of media managers, mobile applications, and social networking platforms leverage its Application Programming Interface (API). At the time of writing, TMDB catalogues approximately eighty thousand films, which is significantly fewer than those listed on IMDb. Although it may not be as comprehensive as IMDb, it boasts extensive information for most popular Hollywood films.

This dataset comprises the ten thousand most popular movies worldwide, fetched via the read API. TMDB's free API allows developers and their teams to programmatically retrieve and utilize TMDB's data, provided they acknowledge TMDB as the source of the data and/or images. Moreover, the API is subject to periodic updates. This dataset was compiled utilizing an exception handling process; consequently, it contains some null values due to missing fields in the TMDB database. Dealing with these missing values will be a valuable experience for a young analyst.
