The Strikes dataset is a binarized regression problem that originated from various studies in the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This particular version is a modified rendition of the original dataset, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature.

This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as Negative, denoted by 'N'. The resulting dataset comprises several features, including Country Code, Year, Strike Volume, Unemployment, Inflation, and Parliamentary Representation.
