Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Country Code, Year, Strike Volume, Unemployment, Inflation, Parliamentary Representation, Binary Class

This dataset focuses on strikes and related socioeconomic factors across different countries and years. It has been transformed from its original numeric format into a binary classification problem, where instances are categorized as either positive or negative based on their relation to the mean target value. The dataset includes information on strike volumes, unemployment rates, inflation levels, and parliamentary representation, which could be used to analyze patterns and correlations in labor disputes and economic conditions. This binarized version may be particularly useful for mythbusting studies and regression analyses in the field of labor economics and political science.
