Digital Currency Time Series

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning Context

I am excited to share with you a starter dataset for practicing time series analysis. This is my inaugural upload, and I look forward to receiving any questions or feedback you may have.

The data was carefully prepared using the Alpha Vantage Application Programming Interface. It represents historical daily time series data for a digital currency, specifically Bitcoin, traded on the Saudi market against the Saudi Riyal. Additionally, prices and volumes are also quoted in United States Dollars. The data covers a period from May eleventh to January thirtieth.

Your task is to utilize the past data to forecast future trends! Please refer to the tasks section for more information.

Special acknowledgement goes out to my instructors and friends at General Assembly for their support.

This dataset boasts an array of interesting features, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume values quoted in both Saudi Riyal and United States Dollars.
