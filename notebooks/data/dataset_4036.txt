QSAR-TID-11064 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11064. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calcitonin Receptor. The Calcitonin Receptor is a single protein, also known as C one A/C one B Calcitonin Receptor, Calcr, and CT-R. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the family B G protein-coupled receptor, and is involved in peptide receptor activity.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, and Reactome. It provides a detailed description of the Calcitonin Receptor, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and gene ontology.
