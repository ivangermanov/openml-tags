This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calcitonin Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including identifiers and a class feature. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identifiers, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, and many others. 

The Calcitonin Receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as C one A/C one B Calcitonin Receptor, Calcr, CT-R. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified under membrane receptor, family B G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and calcitonin-like receptor. 

The receptor is involved in various biological processes including ossification, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and others. It is also associated with certain components such as acrosomal vesicle, plasma membrane, cilium, and neuronal cell body. Furthermore, the receptor has certain functions like calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor activity, transmembrane signaling receptor activity, and G protein-coupled receptor activity.
