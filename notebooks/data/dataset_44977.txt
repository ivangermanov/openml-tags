California Housing
Tags: Data Description

Information on the variables was collected using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. In this sample, a block group on average includes individuals living in a geographically compact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. Distances among the centroids of each block group were computed as measured in latitude and longitude. All the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables were excluded. The final data contained observations on nine variables. Each row in the dataset represents one census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data, typically having a population of six hundred to three thousand people. The goal of the dataset is to predict the median house value. The original dataset description advised predicting the value using a logarithmic transform.
