Heart Switzerland Dataset

This dataset contains seventy-six attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of fourteen of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by Machine Learning researchers to this date. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is an integer valued from zero (no presence) to four.

Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values one, two, three, four) from absence (value zero). The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been processed, that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.
