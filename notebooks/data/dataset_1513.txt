This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor. It has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor is a single protein preferred name, also known as Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor GRP-Preferring Bombesin Receptor Grpr GRP-R. It belongs to the species group Rattus Norvegicus and is classified as one membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR GRP-related receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, learning or memory, social behavior, psychomotor behavior, regulation of cell population proliferation, response to external biotic stimulus, motor behavior, positive regulation of respiratory gaseous exchange, and positive regulation of behavioral fear response.
