This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by machine learning researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory. To see Test Costs, please see the folder "Costs"

Attribute Information:
Only 14 attributes used:
age

ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak)
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)
number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca)
thalassemia (thal)
diagnosis of heart disease (num) (the predicted attribute)

The dataset includes various measurements related to heart health, including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and exercise test outcomes. It aims to predict the presence and severity of heart disease based on these factors.
