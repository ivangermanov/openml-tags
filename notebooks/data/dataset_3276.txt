This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has thirty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September. This dataset is related to the single protein preferred name RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, also known as Akt, Akt one kinase, PKB, and PKB alpha.

The RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase is found in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, spindle, cytosol, plasma membrane, cell-cell junction, microtubule cytoskeleton, membrane, vesicle, and protein-containing complex. Its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity, enzyme inhibitor activity, protein kinase C binding, protein binding, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, phosphatidylinositol-three, four, five-trisphosphate binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, enzyme binding, protein kinase binding, nitric-oxide synthase regulator activity, protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor activity, protein kinase activator activity, GTPase activating protein binding, identical protein binding, protein homodimerization activity, phosphatidylinositol-three, four-bisphosphate binding, protein phosphatase two A binding, fourteen-three-three protein binding, potassium channel activator activity, and protein serine kinase activity.
