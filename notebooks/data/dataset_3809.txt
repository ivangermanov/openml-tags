QSAR-TID-11082 Tags: Computational Universe, Computer Systems, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11082, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50. The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase two, which is an enzyme involved in various cellular processes including cell signaling, gene expression, and cell proliferation.

The dataset includes multiple features that describe the molecular structure and properties of the compounds, such as molecular weight, logP, and polar surface area. These features can be used to build predictive models of compound activity against the target enzyme.

The MAP kinase-activated protein kinase two is a key player in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in regulating various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in various diseases including cancer, inflammatory disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.
