QSAR-TID-11082 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11082. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1695 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated Protein Kinase 2, also known as MAPKAPK2. It is a single protein and its preferred name is MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2. It has several synonyms, including MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, MAPKAPK2, MAPKAP-K2, MAPKAP-2, and MAPKAP kinase 2.

The protein is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CAMK protein kinase group, CAMK protein kinase MAPKAPK family, and CAMK protein kinase MAPKAPK subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response, DNA damage response, and regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway.

The protein has several molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity, protein binding, calmodulin binding, ATP binding, and calcium-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity.

The protein is located in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, centrosome, cytosol, and extracellular exosome.

Keywords: MAPKAPK2, protein kinase, CAMK, MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response.
