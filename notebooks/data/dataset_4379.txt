Subsampling of the dataset Phoneme with seed equals zero arguments N Rows equals two thousand, N Columns equals one hundred, N Classes equals ten, and No Stratify equals False. 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters including seed, N Rows Max, N Columns Max, N Classes Max, and Stratified, and returns a dataset. 
It uses NumPy's default random generator to generate random numbers.
It then selects unique classes from the target variable, and if there are more than N Classes Max, it chooses a specified number of classes using their value counts as probabilities.
It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present, and subsets the data accordingly.
If the number of columns exceeds N Columns Max, it uniformly samples columns, sorts them, and subsets the data again.
Finally, if the number of rows exceeds N Rows Max, it uses Stratified Train Test Split to split the data into a subset of the specified size.
