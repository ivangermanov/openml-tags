Magic Telescope Dataset Subsampling with Seed One

This dataset is a subsample of the Magic Telescope dataset, generated with a seed of one. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns, as well as stratified sampling of rows.

The original dataset was reduced to a maximum of ten classes, and the classes were selected based on their frequency in the original dataset. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, and the resulting dataset was further reduced to a maximum of one hundred columns. The columns were selected uniformly at random from the remaining columns.

Finally, the dataset was reduced to a maximum of two thousand rows, using stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution was preserved. The stratified sampling was performed using the train test split function from scikit-learn, with the target variable being the class label.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features and the corresponding class labels. The features include length, width, size, concentration, asymmetry, and distance, among others. The class labels are categorical and have been converted to string format for use with OpenML.
