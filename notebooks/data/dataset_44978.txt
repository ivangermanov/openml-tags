**Data Description**
The Computer Activity databases are a collection of computer systems activity measures. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files, or running very CPU-bound programs. The data was collected continuously on two separate occasions. On both occasions, system activity was gathered every five seconds. The final dataset is taken from both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming from each collection epoch. Each instance represents one observed system performance. The goal is to predict the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset consists of various attributes that describe the system's activity. These attributes include the number of reads and writes between system memory and user memory, system calls of all types, system read and write calls, fork and exec calls, character transfers, page out requests, pages paged out, pages placed on the free list, pages checked if they can be freed, page attaches, page-in requests, pages paged in, page faults caused by protection errors, page faults caused by address translation, process run queue size, memory pages available to user processes, and disk blocks available for page swapping.

The dataset also includes the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode, which is the target variable to be predicted.
