QSAR-TID-11364 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11364. The dataset has a total of 969 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are useful for predicting the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.

The features in the dataset are primarily molecular fingerprints, which are binary vectors that represent the presence or absence of specific molecular substructures. These fingerprints are generated using the FCFP 1024bit algorithm, which is a widely used method for generating molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a large collection of QSAR data that can be used to train machine learning models and predict the activity of compounds on specific drug targets.
