This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. 

The dataset has multiple features, including molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. The features represent fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. 

The target is a single protein preferred named AMP activated protein kinase, alpha one subunit. It has synonyms, including five prime AMP activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha one, ACACA kinase, Acetyl CoA carboxylase kinase, AMPK one, and AMPK subunit alpha one.

It belongs to the species group of no protein target classification of enzyme kinase protein kinase CAMK protein kinase group CAMK protein kinase CAMK one family CAMK protein kinase AMPK subfamily. 

It has a description relationship accession of five prime AMP activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha one. 

There are multiple relationships, including ChEMBL ID, relationship, preferred name, target type, and so on. 

It has multiple expressions, including Go Component, Go Function, and Go Process. 

Go Component includes chromatin, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, apical plasma membrane, nuclear speck, axon, dendrite, nucleotide activated protein kinase complex, and protein containing complex.

Go Function includes nucleotide binding, chromatin binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, AMP activated protein kinase activity, cAMP dependent protein kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, protein containing complex binding, metal ion binding, and so on.
