QSAR-TID-102420 Dataset: Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102420. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.
