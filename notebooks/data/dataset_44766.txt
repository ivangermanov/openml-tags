Click Prediction Small Seed Three Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Click Prediction Small Dataset with Seed Three

This dataset is a subsample of the Click Prediction Small dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are present in the resulting dataset. The number of classes was limited to a maximum of ten.

The columns of the dataset were also uniformly sampled, with a maximum of one hundred columns selected. The resulting dataset has a subset of the original columns, with the categorical columns converted to string format for OpenML compatibility.

The dataset was generated using a specific source code, which involved using the NumPy random default generator to sample the classes and columns. The stratified sampling method was used to ensure that the resulting dataset is representative of the original dataset.

The features of this dataset include impression, URL hash, ad identifier, advertiser identifier, depth, position, query identifier, keyword identifier, title identifier, description identifier, and user identifier. The click feature is also included in the dataset.
