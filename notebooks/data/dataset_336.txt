The SPECT Heart dataset is a collection of single proton emission computed tomography images used for diagnosing cardiac conditions. Each patient is categorized into two classes: normal and abnormal. The dataset consists of 267 SPECT image sets, which were processed to extract features that summarize the original images. This resulted in forty-four continuous feature patterns being created for each patient, which were then further processed to obtain twenty-two binary feature patterns.

The CLIP3 algorithm was utilized to generate classification rules from these patterns, achieving an accuracy rate of eighty-four percent when compared to cardiologists' diagnoses. This dataset is suitable for testing machine learning algorithms, comprising 267 instances described by twenty-three binary attributes.

There are no missing values in the dataset. The attributes include Overall Diagnosis, which is the class attribute, and twenty-two partial diagnoses, each represented as a binary value.

The dataset is divided into training data and testing data, with eighty instances in the training set and one hundred eighty-seven instances in the testing set.
