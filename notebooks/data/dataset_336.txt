SPECT Heart Dataset

Tags: mythbusting, study, uci

This dataset describes the diagnosis of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Patients are classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. The database consists of SPECT image sets from patients, which were processed to extract features summarizing the original images. Initially, continuous feature patterns were created for each patient, which were then further processed to obtain binary feature patterns.

The CLIP algorithm was employed to generate classification rules from these patterns, achieving an accuracy of eighty four percent when compared with cardiologists' diagnoses. This makes SPECT a valuable dataset for testing machine learning algorithms, as it contains instances described by binary attributes.

The dataset includes an overall diagnosis attribute, which serves as the class attribute, along with numerous partial diagnosis attributes. All attributes are binary, taking values of zero or one. The partial diagnoses cover various aspects of the SPECT analysis, providing a comprehensive view of the patient's cardiac condition.

This merged version combines the typically separate training and test sets. On OpenML, the train test split can be found as one of the possible tasks. The original dataset was divided into training data and testing data, with eighty instances in the training set and one hundred and eighty seven instances in the test set.

The SPECT Heart dataset is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of medical imaging and diagnostic algorithms. It provides a real world application of machine learning in healthcare, specifically in the area of cardiac diagnostics.
