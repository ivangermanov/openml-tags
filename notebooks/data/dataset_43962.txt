**Energy Efficiency**

This dataset was obtained from the UCI Repository. The dataset was created to perform energy analysis using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the aforementioned characteristics to obtain seven hundred sixty-eight building shapes.

The dataset comprises seven hundred sixty-eight samples and eight features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

The dataset contains eight attributes and two responses. In the original data, the aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. For this version of the dataset however, only the Heating Load is used as the target, while the Cooling Load is being ignored. In addition, the variables were renamed to be more meaningful.

The dataset can be used for accurate quantitative estimation of energy performance of residential buildings using statistical machine learning tools. It is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of energy efficiency and building design.
