QSAR-TID-143 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one forty-three. The dataset has rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. This particular dataset is focused on the activity of compounds on a specific drug target, and it includes a large number of features that describe the molecular structure of the compounds.

The features in this dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing the molecular structure of a compound as a binary vector. This allows for the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the activity of compounds based on their molecular structure.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It provides a large and diverse set of compounds with activity data, which can be used to train and test QSAR models.
