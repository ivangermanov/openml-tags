This dataset provides historical price data of the FOREX Euro versus Hungarian Forint (EUR/HUF) exchange rate, sourced from Dukascopy's Historical Data Feed.

Each instance represents a single day's worth of data, comprising one candlestick. The entire dataset spans a specific timeframe, excluding weekends when the FOREX market is closed.

The timestamp feature corresponds to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the directional change in the mean high price between the current day and the subsequent day. Specifically, if the mean high price increases, the class attribute is labeled as true; otherwise, it is false if the price remains stagnant or decreases.

Please note that this dataset serves solely for scientific purposes and should not be used for actual trading strategies. Realistic trade approaches require predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.
