Particulate Matter UK Air 2017

Tags: Hourly particulate matter air pollution data of Great Britain for the year 2017, provided by Ricardo Energy and Environment on behalf of the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Devolved Administrations on uk-air.defra.gov.uk. 

The data was scraped from the UK AIR homepage via the R-package rdefra on a specific date. The data was published by DEFRA under the Open Government Licence (OGL). For a description of all variables, check out the UK AIR homepage. The variable 'Particulate Matter 10 - Particulate Matter Hourly measured' was chosen as the target. The dataset also contains another measure of particulate matter 'Particulate Matter 2.5 - Particulate Matter Hourly measured' which could be used as the target instead. The string variable 'Date Time' could be used to construct additional date/time features. 

In this version of the dataset, the features 'Longitude' and 'Latitude' were removed to increase the importance of the categorical features 'Zone' and 'Site Name'. Features: Date Time, Hour, Month, Day of Week, Site Name, Environment Type, Zone, Altitude in meters, Particulate Matter 10 - Particulate Matter Hourly measured, Particulate Matter 2.5 - Particulate Matter Hourly measured.
