The Asteroid Dataset features information about asteroids, including their Space Kidney ID, Full Name, whether they are Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, their Absolute Magnitude, Diameter, Albedo, and Diameter Sigma. Additionally, the dataset includes orbital elements such as Eccentricity, Semi-Major Axis, Perihelion Distance, Inclination, Longitude of Ascending Node, Argument of Perihelion, Mean Anomaly, Aphelion Distance, and Orbital Period. The dataset also provides information on the asteroid's Taxonomic Class, Root Mean Square error, and Minimum Orbital Intersection Distance.
