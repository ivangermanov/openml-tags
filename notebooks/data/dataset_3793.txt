QSAR-TID-12 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: twelve, and it consists of nine hundred twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The target molecule is plasminogen, also known as activation peptide, angiostatin, plasmin heavy chain A, plasmin heavy chain A short form, and plasmin light chain B.

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens, and its protein target classification is enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S one A subfamily.

Keywords: QSAR, plasminogen, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR project, serine protease.
