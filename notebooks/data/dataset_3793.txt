QSAR-TID-12 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 927 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The drug target TID: 12 is a single protein, also known as Plasminogen, which is a serine protease involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis.

Plasminogen is a key enzyme in the blood clotting cascade, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including thrombosis and cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Plasminogen, which can aid in the discovery of new therapeutic compounds.
