Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on body fat measurements and related physical characteristics. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem. The target variable has been transformed from a continuous numeric value to a categorical one with two classes: positive and negative. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean of the original target values and using it as a threshold. Instances with target values below the mean are classified as positive, while those above are classified as negative.

The dataset includes various physical measurements that could potentially be used to predict body fat percentage. These measurements encompass overall body dimensions as well as specific body part measurements. The features include density, age, weight, height, and circumference measurements of various body parts such as the neck, chest, abdomen, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, biceps, forearm, and wrist.

This binarized version of the dataset may be particularly useful for studies focusing on binary classification problems related to body composition. It could potentially be applied in fields such as health sciences, nutrition, and fitness research.
