Body Fat Dataset: A Binarized Version for Myth-Busting and Scientific Study

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It involves converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion is achieved by computing the mean and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('Positive') and all others as negative ('Negative').

The dataset comprises various physical attributes, including density, age, weight, height, and several body measurements such as neck circumference, chest circumference, abdomen circumference, hip circumference, thigh circumference, knee circumference, ankle circumference, biceps circumference, forearm circumference, and wrist circumference. These attributes are correlated with the binary class feature to facilitate analysis and research.
