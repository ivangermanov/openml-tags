The Higgs dataset is a computer systems and machine learning dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way as the original dataset. It belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset is a smaller version of the original dataset, containing one million rows. It is sourced from the University of California Irvine and is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset is related to Higgs Boson detection data, which was produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by particle detectors in the accelerator. These features include properties such as lepton momentum, lepton direction, and missing energy measurements. The last seven features are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes.

There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. The last five hundred thousand examples are used as a test set.

Attribute information includes the class label, which is either one for signal or zero for background. The dataset also includes twenty-one low-level features, which are kinematic properties, and seven high-level features derived by physicists.

For more detailed information about each feature, refer to the original paper. Relevant papers include research on searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning.
