Quake Dataset: A Binarized Regression Problem 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The Quake dataset is related to the fields of Chemistry and Life Science, and is also associated with myth-busting and various studies. 

Features of this dataset include Focal Depth, Latitude, and Longitude, which provide important information about earthquakes.
