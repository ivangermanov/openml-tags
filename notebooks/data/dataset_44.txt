SPAM Email Database

The "spam" concept is diverse, encompassing advertisements for products and websites, get-rich-quick schemes, chain letters, and pornography. The collection of spam emails in this dataset came from postmasters and individuals who had filed spam reports. Non-spam emails were sourced from work-related and personal correspondence, which means certain words and area codes may inadvertently serve as indicators of non-spam messages. This characteristic could be useful when developing a personalized spam filter, but for a general-purpose filter, one would need to either obscure such non-spam indicators or gather a much broader collection of non-spam emails.

The dataset is designed for the classification task of determining whether a given email is spam or not. Each instance in the dataset represents an individual email. The features primarily indicate the frequency of particular words or characters occurring in the email. Additionally, there are attributes measuring the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters.

The attributes fall into several categories:

Word frequency attributes: These measure the percentage of words in the email that match specific words. There are numerous such attributes, each corresponding to a different word.

Character frequency attributes: These measure the percentage of characters in the email that match specific characters.

Capital run length attributes: These measure various aspects of sequences of consecutive capital letters, including the average length, the longest sequence, and the total number of capital letters.

The final attribute is the class label, indicating whether the email was classified as spam or not.

Typical performance on this dataset achieves around misclassification error. False positives (incorrectly marking legitimate mail as spam) are considered highly undesirable. When aiming for zero false positives in the training and testing sets, approximately of spam messages passed through the filter.

The dataset contains missing values, which should be taken into consideration during analysis and model development.

This spam email classification problem presents an interesting challenge in the field of machine learning and data mining, balancing the need for effective spam detection with the importance of minimizing false positives to ensure important messages are not mistakenly filtered out.
