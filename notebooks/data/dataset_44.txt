SPAM Email Database

The concept of spam is diverse, encompassing advertisements for products and websites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography, and other forms of unwanted emails. Our collection of spam emails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam complaints. On the other hand, our collection of non-spam emails came from filed work and personal emails.

The classification task for this dataset is to determine whether a given email is spam or not. This is a challenging task due to the diversity of spam emails. However, certain indicators such as the presence of specific words or characters can be useful in constructing a personalized spam filter.

One would need to either blind such non-spam indicators or gather a vast collection of non-spam emails to generate a general-purpose spam filter. For background information on spam, one can refer to the article "Spam!" by Cranor and LaMacchia.

Typical performance of a spam classifier on this dataset is around seven percent misclassification error. However, false positives, which involve marking legitimate emails as spam, are highly undesirable. In fact, if we insist on zero false positives in the training and testing sets, twenty to twenty-five percent of spam emails would pass through the filter undetected.

Attribute Information:

The dataset consists of various attributes that indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occurring in the email. There are forty-eight continuous real attributes representing the frequency of specific words in the email. Additionally, there are six continuous real attributes representing the frequency of certain characters in the email. Furthermore, there are three attributes measuring the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters.

Class Attribute:

The class attribute denotes whether the email was considered spam or not, with one indicating spam and zero indicating non-spam.
