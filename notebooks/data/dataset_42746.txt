The KDDCup99 dataset is a standard benchmark for evaluating intrusion detection systems. The task is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between "bad" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and "good" normal connections. The dataset was prepared and managed by MIT Lincoln Labs as part of the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program.

The dataset was created by simulating a typical US Air Force local-area network environment and peppering it with multiple attacks. The raw training data consisted of several gigabytes of compressed binary TCP dump data from several weeks of network traffic, which was then processed into millions of connection records. Each connection record consists of various features, including the duration of the connection, the type of protocol used, the network service on the destination, and the number of data bytes from the source to the destination.

The dataset includes a wide variety of intrusions, which can be categorized into four main types: denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access from a remote machine, unauthorized access to local superuser privileges, and surveillance and other probing. The test data includes specific attack types not present in the training data, making the task more realistic.

To improve the performance of intrusion detection systems, higher-level features were derived from the basic features. These include time-based traffic features, which examine the connections in the past two seconds that have the same destination host or service as the current connection, and calculate statistics related to protocol behavior and service. Host-based traffic features were also constructed using a window of connections to the same host instead of a time window.

Content features were added to look for suspicious behavior in the data portions of packets, such as the number of failed login attempts. These features are useful for detecting unauthorized access attacks.

The dataset provides a comprehensive set of features for each connection record, including basic features, content features, and traffic features. These features can be used to train machine learning models to detect intrusions and improve the security of computer networks.
