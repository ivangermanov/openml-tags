This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes several features such as acid one carbon x, acid one carbon y, base two x, base two y, acid two population, acid three population, temperature, and maximum quality level. These features were carefully selected to provide valuable insights for researchers.
