Please cite: A family of datasets synthetically generated from a simulation of how bank customers choose their banks. Tasks are based on predicting the fraction of bank customers who leave the bank due to full queues.

The bank family of datasets are generated from a simplistic simulator that models queues in a series of banks. The simulator was specifically designed to create a family of datasets for DELVE. Customers originate from various residential areas and select their preferred bank based on distances. They have tasks of varying complexity and different levels of patience. Each bank features multiple queues that open and close according to demand. Tellers exhibit varying levels of effectiveness, and customers may switch queues if their patience expires.

In the rejection prototasks, the objective is to predict the rate of rejections, which represents the fraction of customers turned away from the bank because all open tellers have full queues. The dataset contains cases and continuous attributes.

The simulation takes into account factors such as customer origins, bank distances, task complexity, customer patience, queue dynamics, teller effectiveness, and queue-switching behavior. This comprehensive approach allows for a realistic representation of bank customer interactions and queue management scenarios.

The bank8FM dataset provides a valuable resource for studying and predicting customer behavior in banking environments, particularly focusing on queue management and customer retention. It offers insights into the complex interplay between various factors affecting bank operations and customer satisfaction.
