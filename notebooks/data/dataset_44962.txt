The Forest Fires dataset aims to predict the burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal by using meteorological and other data. The output area was first transformed with a natural logarithm function, and then several data mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the natural logarithm transform. Four different input setups were used.

The dataset consists of thirteen attributes, including the x-axis and y-axis spatial coordinates within the Montesinho park map, the month and day of the week, and several indices from the Fire Weather Index system, such as the Fine Fuel Moisture Code, Duff Moisture Code, Drought Code, and Initial Spread Index. Additionally, the dataset includes temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and outside rain.

The burned area of the forest, which is the target variable, is highly skewed towards zero, making it suitable for modeling with a logarithmic transform. The dataset does not contain any missing values.

The experiments were conducted using a ten-fold cross-validation approach with thirty runs. Two regression metrics were measured: Mean Absolute Deviation and Root Mean Squared Error. A Gaussian support vector machine fed with only four direct weather conditions obtained the best Mean Absolute Deviation value. The best Root Mean Squared Error was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis of the regression error curve shows that the support vector machine model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error, particularly for small fires, which are the majority.
