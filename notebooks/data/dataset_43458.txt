Context
Throughout the world of data science, there are many languages and tools that can be used to complete a given task. While you are often able to use whichever tool you prefer, it is often important for analysts to work with similar platforms so that they can share their code with one another and collaborate more effectively. This is particularly crucial in a team-based environment where multiple people may be working on the same project. Learning what professionals in the data science industry use while at work can help you gain a better understanding of the tasks and responsibilities that you may be asked to perform in the future.

Content
In this project, we are going to explore and discover what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. Our data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey, a comprehensive and extensive dataset that includes responses from a large number of people who write code to analyze data as part of their daily work.
