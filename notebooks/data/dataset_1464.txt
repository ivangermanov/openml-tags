QSAR-TID-19642 Dataset

Tags: Economics, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: nineteen thousand six hundred forty-two. It has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Zero, FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four One,... (skipped due to unreadability)
