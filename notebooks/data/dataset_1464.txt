Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set

Tags: OpenML-CC, OpenML, study, uci

This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and pertains to the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan. It presents a classification problem designed to demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model, which is a modified version of the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model.

The data was collected from a blood transfusion service bus that visits a university in Hsin-Chu City approximately every three months to gather blood donations. To construct the FRMTC model, a random selection of donors was made from the center's database.

The dataset comprises information on donors, including:
- Recency: The number of months since the last donation
- Frequency: The total number of donations made
- Monetary: The total volume of blood donated in cubic centimeters
- Time: The number of months since the first donation
- A binary variable indicating whether the donor gave blood in March (with 'yes' represented by and 'no' represented by)

The target attribute is a binary variable representing whether the individual donated blood in March, with indicating a donation and indicating no donation.

The dataset does not contain any missing values. Descriptive statistics for the variables are provided, including minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation values for each attribute.

For model development and evaluation purposes, the data was split into a training set and a testing set. The training set consists of randomly selected data points, while the remaining data points form the testing set.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in analyzing blood donation patterns, developing predictive models for donor behavior, and exploring the application of marketing models in the context of blood transfusion services.
