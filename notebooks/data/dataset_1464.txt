The Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set is a classification problem that involves predicting whether a blood donor will donate blood again based on their past donation history. This dataset was collected from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan.

To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model, a modified version of RFM, this study randomly selected seven hundred forty-eight donors from the donor database. Each donor's data includes recency, frequency, monetary, time, and a binary variable indicating whether they donated blood in March two thousand seven.

The attributes in this dataset include recency, which is the number of months since the last donation; frequency, which is the total number of donations; monetary, which is the total amount of blood donated in cubic centimeters; time, which is the number of months since the first donation; and a binary variable indicating whether the donor gave blood in March two thousand seven.

This dataset does not have any missing values. The descriptive statistics of the data are shown in Table One. Five hundred data points were randomly selected as the training set, and the remaining two hundred forty-eight were used as the testing set.

Table One shows the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of each attribute. The recency ranges from zero point zero three to seventy-four point four months, with a mean of nine point seven four months and a standard deviation of eight point zero seven months. The frequency ranges from one to fifty times, with a mean of five point five one times and a standard deviation of five point eight four times. The monetary ranges from two hundred fifty to twelve thousand five hundred cubic centimeters, with a mean of thirteen seventy-eight point six eight cubic centimeters and a standard deviation of fourteen fifty-nine point eight three cubic centimeters. The time ranges from two point two seven to ninety-eight point three months, with a mean of thirty-four point four two months and a standard deviation of twenty-four point three two months. The binary variable has a value of one if the donor gave blood in March two thousand seven and zero otherwise, with a mean of one and a standard deviation of zero point seven six.
