The ChSCase Census Dataset has been modified to create a binarized version of the original dataset. This new version converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

Features included in this dataset are Column One, Column Two, Column Three, Column Four, Column Five, Column Six, and Column Seven, which have been retained from the original dataset.

This dataset is tagged with categories including Chemistry, Life Science, MythBusting, Study, and more.
