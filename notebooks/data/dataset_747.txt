Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: motor, screw, pgain, vgain, binary class

This dataset, known as Servo, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified classification problem. The process involved transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification by calculating the mean value and assigning instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This modification allows for easier analysis and application of binary classification algorithms. The dataset includes various features related to servo mechanisms, such as motor characteristics, screw properties, and gain parameters. Researchers and data scientists can utilize this binarized version for mythbusting studies and comparative analyses in machine learning and robotics fields.
