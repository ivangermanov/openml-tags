The Albert dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark, transformed in a uniform way to facilitate classification tasks. This dataset belongs to the classification on both numerical and categorical features benchmark. 

The original dataset is a real-world dataset of interest, formatted as a preprocessed matrix to focus on classification, although additional feature extraction procedures are welcome. The dataset is a binary classification problem, assessed with the normalized Area Under the ROC Curve metric. 

The dataset's structure is revealed, but its identity and type of data are concealed. The final score is the average of rankings on all testing datasets, and winners are determined according to this ranking. The tasks are constrained by a time budget, and the Codalab platform provides shared computational resources. Each code submission is executed in a compute worker with specific characteristics, and its execution time is limited to ensure fairness of evaluation.

Features: Class, and various numerical and categorical features.

Keywords: Tabular data, Classification, Binary classification, Feature extraction, Computational resources, Time budget, Fairness evaluation.
