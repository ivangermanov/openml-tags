The Albert dataset is part of the Tabular Data Benchmark and belongs to the classification on both numerical and categorical features category. This dataset has been transformed in the same way as the other datasets in the benchmark.

The goal of this challenge is to expose researchers to real-world datasets of interest, formatted in a uniform way to facilitate focus on classification. Although the type of data may differ, participants are encouraged to explore additional feature extraction methods.

All problems are binary classification challenges, assessed using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The identity of the datasets and their type remain concealed, while their structure is revealed. Final scores are calculated based on the average of rankings on all testing datasets, generating a comprehensive ranking to determine winners.

To ensure fair evaluation, each code submission is executed within a predetermined time frame on a shared compute worker with specified characteristics. Participants have access to computational resources through the Codalab platform.

Features include various variables relevant to the classification task.
