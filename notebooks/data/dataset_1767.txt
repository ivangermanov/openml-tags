QSAR-TID-13067 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 13067. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
