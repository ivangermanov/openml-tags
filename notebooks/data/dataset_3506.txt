QSAR-TID-101399 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Three, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Three. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Three is a single protein preferred name, also known as MAP Three Kinase or MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase Three or MAPKKK Three or MEKK Three or MEKK. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE Eleven family/STE protein kinase MEKK Two.

The dataset is related to Homo sapiens species group, and the protein target classification is one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE Eleven family/STE protein kinase MEKK Two.

The dataset is also related to various gene ontology terms, including cytoplasm, cytosol, nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, MAP kinase kinase kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, metal ion binding, and protein serine kinase activity.
