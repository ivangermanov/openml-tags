This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature. This was done by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The features included in this dataset are twenty-five in total. These features are related to chemistry and life science studies.

Binary Class is the target feature in this dataset.
