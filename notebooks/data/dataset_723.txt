Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz through oz, followed by a binary class feature.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem used for various studies and mythbusting purposes. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification task by using the mean value as a threshold. Instances below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are labeled as negative. This conversion allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset's origin and creation date are unknown, but it appears to be derived from a pre existing dataset. Users are encouraged to cite this binarized version when utilizing it in their research or applications.

The features in the dataset are not clearly described, but they are labeled systematically from oz to oz, suggesting they may represent different measurements or attributes related to the problem domain. The final feature, binary class, contains the transformed target variable.
