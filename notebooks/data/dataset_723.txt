The MV dataset is a binarized regression problem related to Chemistry and Life Science studies. This dataset is a modified version of the original data, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. The conversion was done by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset consists of several features, including relevant chemical properties. The classification task involves predicting whether a given instance belongs to the Positive or Negative class based on these chemical properties.
