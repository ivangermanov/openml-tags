Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Amazon Employee Access

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is used to reduce the size of the Amazon Employee Access dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics. This is achieved by uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The function takes several parameters, including a seed value for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. 

First, the function identifies the unique classes in the target variable and selects a subset of these classes if there are more than the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the data.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed. It does this by randomly selecting column indices and using these indices to subset the data.

Finally, the function stratifies the sampling of rows if the number of rows exceeds the maximum allowed. This is done using a train-test split function from a popular machine learning library, with the target variable used for stratification.

The resulting dataset is then returned, with the categorical mask and column names preserved.
