Amazon Employee Access Seed Four Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Amazon Employee Access dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters and a seed value of four. The dataset has been reduced to include only two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. 

The dataset generation process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset until the desired number of classes was reached. Then, the indices where one of these classes was present were selected, and the corresponding data points were included in the subsampled dataset. 

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled until the desired number of columns was reached. Finally, the dataset was stratified according to the target variable, and the resulting dataset was returned.

Features included in this dataset are resource, manager ID, role rollup one, role rollup two, role department name, role title, role family description, and role family code.
