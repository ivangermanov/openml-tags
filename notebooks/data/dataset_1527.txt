QSAR-TID-12591 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12591. It has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Eight
