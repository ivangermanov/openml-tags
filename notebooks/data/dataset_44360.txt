Subsampling of the dataset Credit with Seed equals Three 

This dataset has been generated through subsampling of the original Credit dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the unique values present in the target variable. In cases where the number of unique classes exceeded the maximum allowed number of classes, a random selection was made based on the frequency of each class. 

The resulting dataset has undergone column selection, where a specified number of columns were randomly chosen from the original feature set. This selection was performed uniformly, without any bias towards specific features.

To ensure a representative sample, stratification was employed during the sampling process. This involved splitting the data into subsets based on the target variable, ensuring an even distribution of classes within the sample.

Features included in this dataset are revolving utilization of unsecured lines, age, debt ratio, monthly income, number of open credit lines and loans, and number of dependents.
