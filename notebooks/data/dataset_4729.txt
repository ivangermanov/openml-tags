Subsampling of the dataset Riccardo with Seed Four 
Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Riccardo 

Generated with the following source code:

This function enables the subsampling of a dataset. It takes into account several parameters such as the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. The function also allows for stratified sampling.

The function begins by uniformly sampling classes from the dataset. If there are more classes than the specified maximum, it selects the desired number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If there are more columns than the specified maximum, it randomly selects the desired number of columns.

If the resulting dataset has more rows than the specified maximum, the function applies stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution is maintained.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with information about the categorical columns and their corresponding column names.
