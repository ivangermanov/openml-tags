QSAR-TID-100412 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100412. The dataset has 906 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are used to represent the chemical structure of compounds.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target is a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis.

The dataset also includes information about the gene ontology, including component, function, and process annotations. These annotations provide a detailed understanding of the biological processes and molecular functions associated with the drug target.

In addition, the dataset includes links to external resources, such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe, which provide further information about the drug target and its related proteins.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, serine/threonine-protein kinase, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, apoptosis.
