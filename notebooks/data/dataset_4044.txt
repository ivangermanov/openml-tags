Pol Dataset 

This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. It was originally used in a commercial application described in a research paper. Unfortunately, no further information is available about the specific problem it addresses, except that it is related to telecommunications.

The dataset consists of two sets of cases, one with ten thousand examples and another with five thousand examples. Each case has forty-nine continuous attributes. The dataset is part of a larger collection of regression datasets compiled by Luis Torgo, which can be accessed online. 

The original dataset can also be obtained from a separate website. The features included in this dataset are numerous, including many that are not easily readable or interpretable.
