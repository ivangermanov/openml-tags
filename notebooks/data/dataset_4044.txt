The QSAR-TID-100862 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 100862, also known as the metastin receptor. This receptor is a single protein that is also referred to as AXOR twelve, GPR fifty-four, and G-protein coupled receptor fifty-four, among other synonyms.

The metastin receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor that belongs to the family A GPCR and is classified as a peptide receptor. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and neuropeptide signaling pathways.

This dataset consists of one hundred seventy-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule ChEMBL IDs and median pXC fifty values. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The metastin receptor is expressed in humans and is associated with various diseases, including precocious puberty and central hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. It is also targeted by certain pharmaceuticals, as described in the GuideToPHARMACOLOGY database.
