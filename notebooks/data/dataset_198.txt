Delta Elevators Dataset

Please cite: This dataset is derived from the task of controlling the elevators of an F aircraft, although the target variable and attributes differ from the ailerons domain. The target variable in this case represents a variation rather than an absolute value, and there was some pre-selection of the attributes.

This dataset focuses on the control of aircraft elevators, which are crucial components in managing the pitch and altitude of an aircraft during flight. The data collected represents various flight parameters and their impact on elevator control. Unlike similar datasets in the ailerons domain, this one emphasizes variations in control rather than absolute values, providing a unique perspective on aircraft maneuvering.

The attributes in this dataset have been carefully pre-selected to ensure relevance to the elevator control task. These features likely include various flight characteristics such as climb rate, altitude, roll rate, and current roll angle. Additional derived features may also be present, potentially representing differences or rates of change in primary measurements.

Researchers and engineers in the field of aerospace and control systems may find this dataset particularly valuable for developing and testing algorithms related to aircraft control and automation. The focus on variations rather than absolute values could provide insights into the dynamic aspects of elevator control during different flight phases and conditions.
