The Friedman Datasets 

These eighty artificially generated datasets originate from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number". 

Friedman's functions include both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is as follows: 

y = ten times sin of pi x one x two plus twenty times x three minus zero point five squared equals ten X four plus five X five plus e 

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. 

The collinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: 

The number of features varies, and only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. The number of samples also varies. Collinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
