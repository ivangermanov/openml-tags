QSAR-TID-11926 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11926. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 756 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor three is a single protein preferred name, also known as CD antigen equals CD333, FGFR three, FGFR minus three, Fibroblast growth factor receptor three, JTK four. It is an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase group, tyrosine protein kinase FGFR family.

The protein target classification is one enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, tyrosine protein kinase group, tyrosine protein kinase FGFR family. The description relationship accession is Fibroblast growth factor receptor three, single protein, P22607.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.
