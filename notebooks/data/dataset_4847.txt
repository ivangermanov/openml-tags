This supervised learning challenge in machine learning provides thirty datasets, all preformatted in given feature representations, which means each example consists of a fixed number of numerical coefficients. The challenge is to solve classification and regression problems without any further human intervention.

The difficulty lies in the broad diversity of data types and distributions, including balanced or unbalanced classes, sparse or dense feature representations, with or without missing values or categorical variables, and various metrics of evaluation. The problems are drawn from a wide variety of domains, including medical diagnosis from laboratory analyses, speech recognition, credit rating, prediction of drug toxicity or efficacy, classification of text, prediction of customer satisfaction, object recognition, protein structure prediction, and action recognition in video data.

While there exist machine learning toolkits that can solve all these problems, it is still considerable human effort to find the combination of methods and hyperparameter settings that is best suited for a given combination of dataset, task, metric of evaluation, and available computational time. The goal is to create the perfect black box, eliminating the human in the loop.

This is a challenge with code submission, where the code will be executed automatically on the servers to train and test the learning machines with unknown datasets. However, there is no obligation to submit code, and half of the prizes can be won by just submitting prediction results.

There are six rounds, including Prep, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, and Master, where datasets of progressive difficulty are introduced. There is no prerequisite to participate in previous rounds to enter a new round. The rounds alternate between AutoML phases, where submitted code is blind-tested in limited time on the platform using datasets never seen before, and Tweakathon phases, which give participants time to improve their methods by tweaking them on those datasets and running them on their own systems without computational resource limitations.
