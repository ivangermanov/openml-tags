A few years ago, the United States District Court of Houston had a case that arose under Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act of Nineteen Sixty Four, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. The plaintiffs in this case were all female doctors at the Houston College of Medicine who claimed that the college had engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against women in giving promotions and setting salaries.

The lead plaintiff in this action, a pediatrician and an assistant professor, was denied promotion at the college. The plaintiffs had presented a set of data to show that female faculty members at the school were less likely to be full professors, more likely to be assistant professors, and earned less money than their male counterparts, on average.

The dataset includes information about the faculty members' departments, genders, clinical versus research emphases, board certifications, publication rates, years of experience, ranks, and salaries in Nineteen Ninety Four and Nineteen Ninety Five.
