QSAR-TID-12831 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12831. The dataset has eighty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Androgen Receptor is a single protein, also known as Androgen Receptor, Ar, Dihydrotestosterone Receptor, and Nr3c4. It is a nuclear receptor subfamily three group C member four, and is involved in various biological processes, including transcription, gene expression, and cell proliferation.

The Androgen Receptor is a transcription factor, and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is a nuclear hormone receptor, and is activated by androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The receptor is involved in the development and maintenance of male characteristics, and is also involved in the development of certain diseases, such as prostate cancer.
