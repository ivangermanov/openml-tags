Binarized Regression Problem Dataset 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The conversion process involved taking the numeric target feature and transforming it into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset comprises various features, including molecular properties and chemical descriptors.
