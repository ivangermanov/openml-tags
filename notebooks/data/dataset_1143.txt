Hill Valley Dataset

Source: UCI 

This dataset represents one hundred points on a two dimensional graph. When plotted in order, from one through one hundred, as the y-coordinate, the points will create either a Hill, which is a bump in the terrain, or a Valley, which is a dip in the terrain. The original source provides some examples of these graphs. 

In its original form, this dataset consists of six files. This particular version is the non-noisy edition, with the training and test sets merged together.

Attribute Information:
The first one hundred attributes are labeled as X followed by a number, and consist of floating-point values, which represent the y-values of the graphs. The one hundred and first attribute is labeled as Class, and consists of binary values, zero or one, which represent either Valley or Hill respectively.

Features: Various numerical values representing the y-coordinates of the graphs.
