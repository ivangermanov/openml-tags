Name: Steel Plates Fault Dataset with Subsampling

Tags: Subsampling of the Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated with a specific set of arguments

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Steel Plates Fault dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The subsampling process started by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded a certain maximum, a random sample of classes was selected, with the probability of each class being selected proportional to its frequency in the original dataset. The indices of the samples belonging to the selected classes were then used to subset the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If the number of columns exceeded a certain maximum, a random sample of columns was selected. The selected columns were then used to subset the dataset.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled. If the number of rows exceeded a certain maximum, a stratified sample of rows was selected, with the stratification based on the target variable. The selected rows were then used to create the final subsampled dataset.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including V1, V2, V3, and so on, up to V27, as well as a target variable.
