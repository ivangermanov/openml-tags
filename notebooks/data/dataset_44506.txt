Subsampling of the dataset Steel Plates Fault with Seed Three 

This dataset has been generated through the process of subsampling the original Steel Plates Fault dataset. The subsampling process involved setting a maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and then uniformly sampling from the original dataset to achieve these maximum values.

The subsampling function takes in several arguments, including a seed value for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratified sampling. 

In this case, the seed value was set to three, the maximum number of rows was set to two thousand, the maximum number of columns was set to one hundred, and the maximum number of classes was set to ten. Additionally, stratified sampling was used to ensure that the sampled data maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.
