APS Failure Seed Two Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the APS Failure dataset with seed equals two

This dataset is a subsample of the APS Failure dataset, which has been reduced to two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. The subsampling process was stratified to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The dataset was generated using the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed value, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. It first uniformly samples the classes, then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. Next, it uniformly samples the columns if required. Finally, it stratifies the sampling accordingly and returns the subsampled dataset.

Features: Airflow, Age, Ambient Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, Battery Voltage, and many more.
