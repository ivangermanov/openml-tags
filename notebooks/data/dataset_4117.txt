This dataset is part of the tabular data benchmark, specifically designed for regression on categorical and numerical features. The original dataset has been transformed to facilitate analysis.

The House Sales dataset contains information about house sale prices in King County, including Seattle. The dataset spans a period of one year, from May to May, and comprises nineteen features that describe various aspects of the houses, including their physical characteristics, location, and age, in addition to the sale price and a unique identifier for each property.

The features included in this dataset are the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the square footage of the living area and lot, whether the property has a waterfront, its grade, the square footage of the area above and below ground level, the year it was built and renovated, its geographic coordinates, and the average square footage of neighboring properties. The date of sale has been broken down into year, month, and day components.

With its large sample size and diverse set of features, this dataset is well-suited for evaluating the performance of simple regression models.
