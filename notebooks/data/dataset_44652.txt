Internet Advertisements Seed Four Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Internet Advertisements dataset, generated with a seed of four. The subsample was created using a specific source code that uniformly samples classes and columns from the original dataset.

The dataset features a total of one hundred columns, including URL pool images, URL information server, URL Charlie, URL derived, URL home, and many others. These features are a mix of human-readable and technical terms related to URLs and internet addresses.

The dataset was generated using a specific algorithm that selects a subset of classes and columns from the original dataset. The algorithm uses a random number generator to select the classes and columns, ensuring that the subsample is representative of the original dataset.

The dataset has a total of ten classes, which were selected from the original dataset using a stratified sampling approach. This approach ensures that the classes are balanced and representative of the original dataset.

The dataset is useful for machine learning and data analysis tasks, particularly those related to internet advertisements and URL analysis.
