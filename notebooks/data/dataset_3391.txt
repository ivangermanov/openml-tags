Diabetes Dataset 

The Diabetes dataset consists of ten baseline variables, including age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, which were obtained for each of the diabetes patients, along with the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Data Set Characteristics:

The dataset comprises a total number of instances, with each instance having a set of ten attributes that are numeric predictive values. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Attribute Information:

The ten attributes include age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, namely Serum One, Serum Two, Serum Three, Serum Four, Serum Five, and Serum Six. It is worth noting that each of these ten feature variables has been mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation, resulting in the sum of squares of each column totaling one.
