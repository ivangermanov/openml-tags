QSAR-TID-100992 

Tags: Computational Universe, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred twenty-two, and it has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biobia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint six one zero two four zero, fingerprint six one zero two four one, fingerprint six one zero two four two, fingerprint six one zero two four three, fingerprint six one zero two four four, fingerprint six one zero two four five, fingerprint six one zero two four six, fingerprint six one zero two four seven, fingerprint six one zero two four eight, fingerprint six one zero two four nine, and many more...
