The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded according to their characteristics, specifically the degree of colinearity and the number of samples and features.

These datasets were created using the Friedman function, which includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, and adds a normalized noise term to the output. The Friedman function takes the form of an equation that combines five input features in a complex way.

To test the performance of algorithms on these datasets, additional features were added that are independent of the output variable. Furthermore, the datasets were generated with varying degrees of colinearity, meaning that some features depend on others.

The parameters used to generate the datasets include the number of features, which ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are actually related to the output. The number of samples also varies, ranging from one hundred to one thousand. Finally, the colinearity degree ranges from zero to four, indicating the number of features that depend on others.

As a result, eighty unique artificial datasets were generated, each with its own combination of features, samples, and colinearity degree. The target variable is included as the last attribute in each dataset.
