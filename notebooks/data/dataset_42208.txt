The NYC Taxi Green Dataset for December 2016 provides trip record data courtesy of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. This dataset comprises trip records of the green taxi line for the month of December 2016. The data was downloaded on a specific date.

For a comprehensive description of all variables present in the dataset, please refer to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission's homepage. The target variable selected is Tip Amount. Notably, Total Amount has been intentionally excluded to prevent deterministic prediction.

Date-related variables, including Pickup Datetime and Drop-off Datetime, have been ignored by default but can be utilized to compute additional time-based features. This particular version focuses exclusively on trips where the Payment Type equals one, which corresponds to credit card transactions, as tips are rarely included for other payment methods. Furthermore, the variables Trip Distance and Fare Amount have been omitted to amplify the significance of categorical features, namely Pickup Location ID and Drop-off Location ID.

Features include Vendor Identification, Store and Forward Flag, Rate Code ID, Pickup Location ID, Drop-off Location ID, Passenger Count, Extra Charges, MTA Tax, Tip Amount, Tolls Amount, Improvement Surcharge, and Trip Type.
