The NYC Taxi Green December 2016 dataset is a collection of trip record data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. This dataset includes trip records of the green line for the month of December 2016. The data was downloaded on a specific date. For a detailed description of all variables in the dataset, please refer to the Taxi and Limousine Commission's homepage.

The target variable chosen for this dataset is the Tip Amount. The Total Amount variable is ignored by default, as it could otherwise be used to predict the target deterministically. The date variables, Pickup Date and Time and Drop-off Date and Time, are also ignored by default, but could be used to compute additional time features.

In this version of the dataset, only trips with a Payment Type of Credit Card are included, as tips are not typically included for other payment types. The variables Trip Distance and Fare Amount have been removed to increase the importance of the categorical features Pickup Location ID and Drop-off Location ID.

The features included in this dataset are Vendor ID, Pickup Date and Time, Drop-off Date and Time, Store and Forward Flag, Rate Code ID, Pickup Location ID, Drop-off Location ID, Passenger Count, Extra, MTA Tax, Tip Amount, Tolls Amount, Improvement Surcharge, and Trip Type.
