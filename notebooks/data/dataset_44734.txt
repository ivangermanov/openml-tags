Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset by uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows. It ensures that the resulting dataset has the specified number of classes, columns, and rows, while maintaining the original class distribution.

The function first selects the specified number of classes using their value counts as probabilities. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of rows exceeds the specified maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly and selects a subset of rows.

The resulting dataset is returned with the original dataset name, the subsampled features, target variable, categorical mask, and column names.
