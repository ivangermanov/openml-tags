Sub-sampling of the dataset Volkert with a specified seed value. This sub-sampled dataset has been generated using specific parameters, including a maximum number of rows, columns, and classes.

The sub-sampling process involves uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the specified maximum, the classes are chosen based on their frequency of occurrence. The corresponding indices are then selected, and the dataset is reduced to include only these instances.

Next, the columns are uniformly sampled if necessary. The column indices are randomly chosen, and the dataset is reduced to include only these columns.

Finally, the instances are sub-sampled according to the specified maximum number of rows. This is done while maintaining the class distribution through stratified sampling.

Features: Various variables have been included in this sub-sampled dataset.
