Name: BNG (Wine Quality)

Tags: Artificial, BNG

Features: Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol, Quality

This dataset, known as BNG (Wine Quality), is an artificial dataset focused on various characteristics of wine. It includes multiple features that are crucial in determining the quality of wine. These features encompass chemical properties such as acidity levels (both fixed and volatile), citric acid content, and residual sugar. Additionally, it measures chloride levels, sulfur dioxide concentrations (both free and total), density, pH balance, sulphate content, and alcohol percentage. The ultimate feature, quality, likely represents an overall assessment of the wine based on these various factors.
