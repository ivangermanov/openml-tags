Name: Ozone Level Eight Hour Seed Two 
Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Ozone Level Eight Hour 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in several parameters including a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to use stratification. It returns a new dataset.

First, it initializes a random number generator using the given seed. Then, it uniformly samples classes from the existing dataset. If there are more than the maximum allowed number of classes, it selects the specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset.

Next, it selects the indices where one of the chosen classes is present and filters the data accordingly. After that, it uniformly samples columns if required. If there are more columns than the maximum allowed, it randomly chooses the specified number of columns.

If the resulting dataset has more rows than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select the specified number of rows. This ensures that the class distribution remains the same.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to strings and returns the new dataset along with its characteristics.
