**Hailfinder Bayesian Network. Sample 6.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, and the average degree is two point three six. The maximum in-degree is four.

The Hailfinder system is a Bayesian system for forecasting severe weather.
