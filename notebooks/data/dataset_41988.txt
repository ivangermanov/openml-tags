The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate, as the competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge.

To allow scientists without a background in image processing to participate, we provide pre-calculated feature sets. Each feature set contains the same directory structure as the training image set. For details on the parameters of the feature algorithm, please have a look at the file Feature Description, which is part of each archive file.

The file contains three sets of differently configured Histograms of Oriented Gradients features. The sets contain feature vectors of varying lengths. The features were calculated using the source code from a specific website. For detailed information on Histograms of Oriented Gradients, we refer to the concept of Human Detection.
