BNG Colic Original Dataset 

Tags: Features 

The dataset includes information about patients who underwent surgery, including their age at the time of the operation. Each patient is identified by a unique hospital number. The dataset also contains various physiological parameters recorded during the examination, such as rectal temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature of extremities. Furthermore, it includes information about the condition of the mucous membranes, peripheral pulse, capillary refill time, and the level of pain experienced by the patient. The peristalsis, or movement of the intestines, and abdominal distension were also assessed. Some patients had a nasogastric tube inserted, which allowed for the measurement of nasogastric reflux and its pH level. A rectal examination was performed to check for the presence of feces. The appearance of the abdomen was noted, along with the results of packed cell volume and total protein tests. Abdominocentesis, a procedure where fluid is withdrawn from the abdomen, was performed, and the appearance and total protein levels of this fluid were recorded. The outcome of each case, including any surgical lesions found, the site and type of lesion, and its subtype, were documented. Finally, pathological data from cytological preparations was collected.
