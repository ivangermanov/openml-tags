Corporate Credit Rating

A corporate credit rating expresses a firm's ability to repay its debt to creditors. Credit rating agencies are the entities responsible for making this assessment and giving a verdict. When a big corporation from the US or anywhere in the world wants to issue a new bond, it hires a credit agency to make an assessment so that investors can know how trustworthy the company is. The assessment is based especially on financial indicators that come from the balance sheet. Some of the most important agencies in the world are Moody's, Fitch, and Standard and Poor's.

Content

A list of credit ratings issued by major agencies such as Standard and Poor's to big US firms traded on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq from a certain period of time. There are thirty features for every company, of which twenty-five are financial indicators. They can be divided into several categories: Liquidity Measurement Ratios, Profitability Indicator Ratios, Debt Ratios, Operating Performance Ratios, and Cash Flow Indicator Ratios.

Liquidity Measurement Ratios include current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, and days of sales outstanding. Profitability Indicator Ratios include gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pretax profit margin, net profit margin, effective tax rate, return on assets, return on equity, and return on capital employed. Debt Ratios include debt ratio and debt equity ratio. Operating Performance Ratios include asset turnover. Cash Flow Indicator Ratios include operating cash flow per share, free cash flow per share, cash per share, operating cash flow sales ratio, and free cash flow operating cash flow ratio.
