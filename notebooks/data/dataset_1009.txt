The Auto Price dataset, tagged as Artificial, BNG, Chemistry, and Medicine, features a range of attributes related to vehicles. These attributes include Symboling, Length, Width, Height, Curb Weight, Engine Size, Bore, Stroke, Compression Ratio, Horsepower, Peak RPM, City MPG, Highway MPG, and Price.

Note: I skipped "normalized losses", "wheel base" as they were not easily readable. Let me know if you want me to keep them.

Keywords: Auto Price, Vehicle Attributes, Engine Specifications, Fuel Efficiency.
