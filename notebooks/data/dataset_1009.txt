Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: This dataset includes various measurements related to vegetation cover, including white clover, bare ground, cocksfoot, other grasses, other legumes, ryegrass, and weeds. These measurements were taken over multiple years, providing a temporal perspective on vegetation changes. Additional features include strata, plot, paddock, and a combined strata variable. The target variable is a binary classification.

This dataset appears to be focused on studying changes in vegetation composition over time, with a particular emphasis on white clover and other plant species commonly found in grasslands or pastures. The binarization of the target variable suggests that the dataset may be used for predictive modeling or classification tasks related to vegetation patterns or agricultural management practices.

The temporal nature of the data, spanning multiple years, allows for the analysis of trends and changes in plant community composition. This could be valuable for ecological studies, agricultural research, or land management applications.
