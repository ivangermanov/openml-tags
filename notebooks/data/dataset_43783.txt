Covid-19 Research Articles Dataset (NCBI)

I collected a comprehensive dataset of Covid-19 research articles from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website, which will be utilized in Machine Learning algorithms and Data Analysis, including Sentiment Analysis, Time Series, Recommender System, and Classification.

The dataset consists of the following features:

* Content Link: a URL to the research article
* Title: the title of the research article
* Keywords: words under which the research article is categorized
* Dates: the publication date
* Online Abstract: a brief summary of the article, including methods and hypothesis
* Conclusion: the findings of the research

Please note that, for the sake of time, some columns have been left with null string values. It is up to the user to filter the values and use what is most appropriate for their Machine Learning model.

I did not include authors or contributors as this information will not serve a purpose in this dataset.

My inspiration for collecting this dataset is to analyze the focus of these studies by examining word frequencies, as well as to examine the volume of publications over time.
