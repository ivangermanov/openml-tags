Covid-19 Research Articles Dataset (NCBI)
Tags: Machine Learning, Manufacturing Context

I have collected a large dataset of Covid-19 research articles from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website, specifically designed to be utilized in machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques such as sentiment analysis, time series analysis, recommender systems, and classification.

The dataset consists of several key features, including:

* A direct link to each research article
* The title of each research article
* Keywords under which each research article is categorized
* The publication date of each research article
* A brief online abstract summarizing each article, including methods and hypotheses
* The conclusion of each research article, outlining the findings of the study

Please note that, for the sake of time, some columns may contain null string values. You may choose to filter these values and utilize only the most relevant data for your machine learning model.

This dataset was inspired by my interest in understanding the primary focus areas of these studies through an analysis of word frequencies, as well as examining the volume of publications over time.
