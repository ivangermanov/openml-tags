The QSAR-TID-30014 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 30014. The dataset has 987 rows and 1026 features, including molecule identifiers and class features.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset is related to the dual specificity protein kinase CLK2, also known as CDC-like kinase 2, which belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase CLK family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, response to ionizing radiation, phosphorylation, peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, regulation of RNA splicing, negative regulation of gluconeogenesis, and protein autophosphorylation.

CLK2 is primarily located in the nucleus and nucleoplasm and plays a role in nuclear bodies and nuclear specks. It has been shown to bind to proteins and ATP and has kinase activity, transferase activity, and protein serine/threonine kinase activity.

The dataset can be used for machine learning and QSAR modeling to predict the activity of compounds against the CLK2 target.
