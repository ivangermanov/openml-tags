Eye Movements Dataset

This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark. It is a straightforward classification task where pre-computed feature vectors for each word in the eye movement trajectory are provided along with class labels.

The dataset consists of several assignments, each consisting of a question followed by ten sentences (news article titles). One of the sentences is the correct answer to the question, five are irrelevant, and four are relevant but do not answer the question.

Each assignment is a time sequence of twenty-two dimensional feature vectors. The first column is the line number, the second column is the assignment number, and the next twenty-two columns are the different features. Columns twenty-five to twenty-seven contain extra information about the example. The training data set contains the classification label in the twenty-eighth column: zero for irrelevant, one for relevant, and two for the correct answer.

Each example represents a single word, and the goal is to return the classification of each read sentence. The twenty-two features provided are commonly used in psychological studies on eye movement, although not all may be relevant in this context. 

The objective is to predict the classification labels (Irrelevant, Relevant, Correct Answer).

Features include Line Number, Assignment Number, Fixation Count, First Pass Count, First Fixation Duration, Previous Fixation Duration, Next Fixation Duration, First Saccade Length, Last Saccade Length, Previous Fixation Position, Landing Position, Leaving Position, Total Fixation Duration, Mean Fixation Duration, Regression Length, Regression Duration, Maximum Pupil Diameter, Maximum Pupil Diameter Lag, Time Protection, Title Number, Word Number, and Label.

Keywords: Eye Movement, Classification, Numerical Features, Psychological Studies, Fixation Duration, Saccade Length, Pupil Diameter, Regression Analysis.
