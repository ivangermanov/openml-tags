Name: Churn Seed Two Rows Two Thousand Columns One Hundred Classes Ten Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Churn with seed equals two, arguments nrows max equals two thousand, ncols max equals one hundred, nclasses max equals ten, and no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It returns a dataset. The function uses numpy's random default random generator with the given seed. It then selects the features x and target y from the dataset. If the number of unique classes in the target is greater than nclasses max, it uniformly samples the classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates x and y accordingly. If the number of columns in x is greater than ncols max, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows in x is greater than nrows max, it stratifies the data accordingly using train test split from scikit learn. It then returns a new dataset with the updated x, y, categorical mask, and columns.
