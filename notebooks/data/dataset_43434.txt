Why did we choose to focus on the period between two thousand seventeen and two thousand twenty? It is because everyone is well aware that December two thousand seventeen marked the point in time when Bitcoin prices experienced an unprecedented surge! Consequently, this specific duration is ideal for predicting future prices. The years preceding two thousand seventeen were characterized by a relatively low price ratio, which could potentially disrupt the accuracy of our prediction models.
