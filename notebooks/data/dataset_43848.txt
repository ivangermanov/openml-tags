NSE Future and Options Dataset

Tags: Context

This dataset is gathered from the National Stock Exchange of India website for the past three months. I am sharing this dataset so that people can analyze it and gather meaningful insights from it. For instance, one can calculate the probability of a stock ending up at maximum pain with the help of open interest.

The dataset contains the stock symbol with which it is traded, expiry date, strike price, and the option pricing of the symbol at that strike price.

Acknowledgement

I would like to express my gratitude to the people working at the National Stock Exchange of India for publishing these reports every day.

Inspiration

Whenever we want to initiate an options trade, we look at various parameters like open interest, change in open interest, technical analysis indicators before deciding to buy or sell the option. Most times, we need to browse multiple websites to gather the data we need. This dataset is an example of how one can customize the data to suit their needs.
