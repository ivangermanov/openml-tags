**CSM: Demographics, Education**

The CSM dataset contains information about movies, collected from various sources including movie databases on the web, YouTube, Twitter, and IMDB. The data is categorized into two main groups: conventional media features and social media features.

The conventional media features include information about the movie itself, such as its genre, ratings, gross earnings, budget, number of screens it was shown on, and whether it was a sequel. These features provide insight into the movie's production and performance.

On the other hand, the social media features are based on data scraped from YouTube and Twitter, including sentiment analysis, views, likes, dislikes, comments, and aggregate followers. These features offer a glimpse into the online engagement and popularity of the movie.

Unfortunately, the dataset does contain missing values. Despite this limitation, the CSM dataset remains a valuable resource for researchers and analysts interested in exploring the relationship between demographics, education, and movie preferences.
