BNG (Anneal)

This dataset contains information about a type of steel product, characterized by its family and product type. The steel itself has specific properties, including a high carbon content, which affects its hardness. It undergoes a process called temper rolling, which impacts its overall condition. Additionally, this steel exhibits excellent formability and strength, making it suitable for various applications.

One of the notable features of this steel is its non-ageing property, ensuring consistent performance over time. Its surface finish and quality are also important aspects, which affect its enamelability. Furthermore, the steel has been tested for its BC, BF, BT, BW/ME, BL, M, Chrom, Phos, CBond, Marvi, Exptl, Ferro, Corr, Blue/Bright/Varn/Clean, Lustre, JuroFM, S, P characteristics.

The steel comes in various shapes, thicknesses, widths, and lengths, making it adaptable to different uses. It may be treated with oil and have specific bore and packing requirements, depending on the intended application. Finally, the steel is classified according to certain standards, ensuring its quality and reliability.
