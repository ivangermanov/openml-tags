The ipums-la-97-small dataset contains unweighted PUMS census data from the Los Angeles and Long Beach areas for the years nineteen seventy, nineteen eighty, and nineteen ninety. The coding schemes have been standardized to be consistent across years.

This dataset is part of a larger collection of federal census data known as the IPUMS project, which has standardized coding schemes to make comparisons across time easy. The data is an unweighted sample of responses from the Los Angeles â€“ Long Beach area.

The household and individual records were flattened into a single table, and all variables that were available for all three years were included. When there was more than one version of a variable, such as for race, the most general was used. For occupation and industry, the nineteen fifty basis was used.

Note that PUMS data is based on cluster samples, meaning samples are made up of households or dwellings from which there may be multiple individuals. Individuals from the same household are no longer independent. This issue is considered further and discussed along with the effects of stratification on standard errors.

There are two versions of this dataset. The small dataset contains a sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area, formed by sampling from the large dataset. The large dataset contains a sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area.

Past usage of this dataset includes detecting group differences and mining contrast sets.
