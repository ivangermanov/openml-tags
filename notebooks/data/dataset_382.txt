IPUMS LA Small Dataset
Tags: derived, study, study

This dataset contains unweighted PUMS census data from the Los Angeles and Long Beach areas for the years 1970, 1980, and 1990. The coding schemes have been standardized by the IPUMS project to be consistent across years. The original source for this dataset is the IPUMS project, which is a large collection of federal census data with standardized coding schemes to facilitate comparisons across time.

The data represents an unweighted 1 in 100 sample of responses from the Los Angeles Long Beach area for the specified years. Household and individual records were flattened into a single table, using all variables available for all three years. When multiple versions of a variable existed, such as for race, the most general version was used. For occupation and industry, the 1950 basis was utilized.

It's important to note that PUMS data is based on cluster samples, meaning samples are composed of households or dwellings from which there may be multiple individuals. Consequently, individuals from the same household are no longer independent. This issue, along with the effects of stratification on standard errors, has been considered in previous research.

The variable "school type" appears to have different coding values across the years 1970, 1980, and 1990. Two versions of this dataset exist: a small dataset containing a 1 in 1000 sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area, formed by sampling from the large dataset; and a large dataset containing a 1 in 100 sample of the same area.

Users are granted a limited license to use and distribute this documentation and the accompanying data, subject to certain conditions. No fee may be charged for use or distribution, and publications and research reports based on the database must cite it appropriately. Users are requested to send copies of any publications, research reports, or educational material making use of the data or documentation to the provided email address.

The dataset includes various features such as year, group quarters, farm status, ownership, income, family composition, demographic information, education, employment, and migration data. These features provide a comprehensive view of the population characteristics in the Los Angeles Long Beach area over the specified time period.
