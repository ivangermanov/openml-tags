This dataset is synthetic and was generated for convenience. It will be referred to as the Pollen Data. The first three variables are the lengths of geometric features observed in sampled pollen grains - a ridge along the x dimension, a nub in the y direction, and a crack along the z dimension. The fourth variable is pollen grain weight, and the fifth is density. There are numerous observations, in random order.

The dataset is broken up into several pieces, Pollen One Dot Dat to Pollen Eight Dot Dat, each with a substantial number of observations. The variables will be called Ridge, Nub, Crack, Weight, Density, and Observation Number for convenience.

It is advisable for the data analyst to note that there is more than one feature to these data. Each feature can be observed through various graphical techniques, but analytic methods, as well, can help uncover the underlying structure of the dataset.

To generate the data, a large number of five-variable, uncorrelated, independent, and identically distributed Gaussian observations were created. Then, another set of observations was generated by duplicating the initial set, reversing the sign on some of the variables, and appending it to the initial set. The order of the observations was subsequently randomized.

Additionally, a message was embedded in the dataset using a dot matrix representation. The data were then scaled, rotated, and translated. Furthermore, some points in space within the data cloud were chosen as ellipsoid centers, and all observations within a certain radius were identified and eliminated to form ellipsoidal voids.
