QSAR-TID-219 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 219. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The MetaQSAR project, which was conducted in September 2015, is the source of this dataset. The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3 is a single protein and is the preferred name for this target. It is also known as CHRM3 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3. The organism for this target is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group. The protein target classification is one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.

The dataset contains activity values of several compounds on this target, and the features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M3 is a protein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, synaptic transmission, and nervous system development. It is also involved in the regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle contraction and insulin secretion.
