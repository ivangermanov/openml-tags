Online Peer to Peer Lending Dataset

Tags: Peer to Peer Lending

This dataset is a concatenation of historical loans from both Prosper and Lending Club, spanning from 2013 to 2018. Currently, the dataset only includes a summary of the loan, which encompasses terms, origination date, loan amount, status, and other relevant information. However, detailed lender data will be added soon. The columns have been matched up as accurately as possible, although some columns are estimated, as indicated below.

The dataset features a range of variables, including the loan number, amount borrowed, term, borrower rate, installment, grade, origination date, listing title, principal balance, principal paid, interest paid, late fees paid, debt sale proceeds received, last payment date, next payment due date, days past due, loan status description, and data source.
