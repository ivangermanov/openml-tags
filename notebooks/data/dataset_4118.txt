Loan Default Prediction

This dataset belongs to the regression on categorical and numerical features benchmark. It originates from the Loan Default Prediction challenge, where participants were tasked with predicting losses for a given set of financial transactions associated with individuals.

The data has undergone standardization, detrending, and anonymization. With over two hundred thousand observations and nearly eight hundred features, each observation is independent from the previous one. A default trigger was recorded for each observation, along with the corresponding loss measurement, which ranges from zero to one hundred. In cases where a default occurred, the loss represents the percentage of the initial notional value of one hundred that was not reimbursed. Conversely, if the loan did not default, the loss was zero.

Missing feature values have been preserved in their original state, allowing competitors to develop strategies for filling these gaps. Some variables are categorical in nature, while others are numerical. Although the data has been stripped of its time dimensionality, the observations are still listed in chronological order from oldest to newest.

Features include identification information, as well as various financial metrics and characteristics.
