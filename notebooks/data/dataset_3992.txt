The Diabetes 130 Hospitals dataset represents ten years of clinical care at 130 United States hospitals and delivery networks, collected from nineteen ninety-nine to two thousand eight. Each record represents the hospital admission record for a patient diagnosed with diabetes whose stay lasted between one to fourteen days.

The features describing each encounter include demographics, such as race, gender, and age, as well as admission source, time in hospital, medical specialty, laboratory procedures, procedures, medications, primary diagnosis, number of diagnoses, glucose serum level, hemoglobin A1C result, insulin, medication changes, and diabetic medication information. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the patient's payer, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as details about their previous hospitalizations, emergency visits, and outpatient days.

The target variable, readmitted, is binarized into whether the patient was readmitted within thirty days of their initial release. 

There is no recommended data split for this dataset; however, a standard train-test split could be used, or a three-way holdout split could be employed for model selection purposes.

It is important to note that this dataset contains sensitive information about the patients, including their age, gender, and race.
