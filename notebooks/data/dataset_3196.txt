QSAR-TID-102 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the Histamine H2 receptor, which is a single protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes.

The Histamine H2 receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion, immune response, and signal transduction. It is also known as the Gastric receptor or H2R.

The dataset contains information on various compounds that have been tested for their activity on the Histamine H2 receptor, including their Molecule ChEMBL ID, Median PXc50, and FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints. The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor that encodes the structural information of a molecule into a binary vector.

The dataset can be used for various purposes, including the development of QSAR models, virtual screening, and lead optimization. It is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.
