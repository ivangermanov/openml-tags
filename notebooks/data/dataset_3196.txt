The QSAR-TID-102 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The target is a single protein, specifically the histamine H2 receptor, also known as gastric receptor I, H2R, HH2R, and HRH2. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and monoamine receptor.

Some of the synonyms for this target include histamine H2 receptor, gastric receptor I, H2R, HH2R, and HRH2. The description of this target includes its relationship with accession, histamine H2 receptor, single protein, and its accession number.

There are multiple compounds associated with this target, including methantheline, lafutidine, famotidine, ranitidine, and cimetidine. These compounds have different mechanisms of action, max phases, and first approval dates.

Some of these compounds have alternative forms and parent molecules, and they have been referenced in various publications, including PubMed, DailyMed, and ISBN.
