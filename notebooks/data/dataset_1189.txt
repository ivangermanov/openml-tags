Volcanoes on Venus - JARtool Experiment Data Set Experiment: A Two

The data was collected by the Magellan spacecraft over a period of approximately four years from nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety-four. The primary objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using Synthetic Aperture Radar. A more detailed discussion of the mission and its objectives is available at Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Magellan webpage.

There exist certain spatial dependencies in the data. For instance, background patches from within a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images. In addition to the images, there are "ground truth" files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. It should be noted that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set, since no human has visited Venus and the image quality does not permit one hundred percent, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by human experts. 

These labels provide some measure of subjective uncertainty, where one indicates a definite volcano, two indicates a probable volcano, three indicates a possible volcano, and four indicates only a pit is visible. More information on the labeling uncertainty problem can be found in relevant papers.

The images are one thousand twenty-four by one thousand twenty-four pixels. The pixel values range from zero to two fifty-five. The pixel value is related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a given spatial location. Higher pixel values indicate greater backscatter, while lower pixel values indicate lesser backscatter. Both topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength affect the amount of backscatter.
