The SRBCT dataset, also known as the Round Blue Cell Tumors dataset, is a microarray dataset used for classification and diagnostic prediction of cancers. This dataset is a result of gene expression profiling and artificial neural networks research. The dataset features a large number of genes, including gene one, gene two, gene three, and so on, up to ninety-eight genes. 

The dataset is a result of research published in a paper titled "Classification and Diagnostic Prediction of Cancers Using Gene Expression Profiling and Artificial Neural Networks" in the journal Nature Medicine. 

Keywords: Round Blue Cell Tumors, microarray, gene expression profiling, artificial neural networks, cancer classification, diagnostic prediction.
