The Midwest Survey dataset contains individual responses from surveys about regional identification conducted by SurveyMonkey. 

Features of this dataset include the respondents' answers to the question "In your own words, what would you call the part of the country where you live?" Additionally, respondents were asked if they personally identify as Midwesterners. 

The survey also inquired about whether various states are considered to be part of the Midwest region. These states include Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Furthermore, respondents were asked about their opinions on whether certain states that border the Midwest region should be included, such as Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. A few western states, namely Montana and Wyoming, were also included in this inquiry.

Other demographic information collected in the survey includes each respondent's zip code, gender, age, household income, education level, and location according to census region.
