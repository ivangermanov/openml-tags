The Kickstarter Projects dataset is a collection of data gathered from the Kickstarter platform, providing valuable insights for project analysis. The dataset includes a range of columns, each offering unique information about the projects. The columns are largely self-explanatory, with the exception of a few that require clarification. 

The USD Pledged column represents the conversion of the pledged amount into US dollars, as performed by Kickstarter. In contrast, the USD Pledge Real column presents the conversion of the pledged amount into US dollars, achieved through the Fixer.io API. Similarly, the USD Goal Real column displays the conversion of the goal amount into US dollars, also facilitated by the Fixer.io API.

The dataset features a range of attributes, including the project's ID, name, category, main category, currency, deadline, goal, launch date, pledged amount, state, number of backers, country, and the aforementioned USD-based conversions.
