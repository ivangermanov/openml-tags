Original Description: The Zurich Public Transport Delay Data is a collection of data from October 30, 2016, to November 27, 2016, cleaned and prepared at Open Data Day. This dataset contains information about various weather conditions and their impact on public transport delays. The features of this dataset include temperature, maximum wind speed, average wind speed, precipitation, dew point, humidity, hour of the day, and minute of the day, all of which are used to predict the delay in public transport.
