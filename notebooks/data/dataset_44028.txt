**QSAR Fish Toxicity**

**Data Source**
This dataset was obtained from the UCI repository and was developed by the Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group at the University degli Studi Milano - Bicocca, Milano, Italy.

**Dataset Description**
This dataset was used to develop quantitative regression QSAR models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales promelas, also known as the fathead minnow, on a set of chemicals. The model response is the LC50 data, which is the concentration that causes death in fifty percent of test fish over a test duration of ninety-six hours. The model comprises six molecular descriptors, which are used to predict the acute aquatic toxicity.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset consists of six molecular descriptors and one quantitative experimental response. The molecular descriptors are CIC0, SM1 Dz, GATS1i, NdsCH, NdssC, and MLOGP. The quantitative response is the LC50, which is measured in negative log of moles per liter.
