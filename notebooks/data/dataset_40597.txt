The Yeast dataset is a multi-label dataset consisting of microarray expression data as well as phylogenetic profiles of yeast. This dataset includes a large number of genes and multiple predictors. A total of fourteen different labels can be assigned to a gene, although label sparsity limited the actual number of labels used.

Features of this dataset include various attributes related to the genetic information of yeast. The Yeast dataset is often used for benchmarking in machine learning research, particularly for evaluating the performance of multi-label classification algorithms. Its characteristics make it an ideal choice for testing the efficacy of different approaches to handling multiple labels.

The Yeast dataset has been widely used in research and has contributed significantly to the development of new methods and techniques in the field of machine learning. Its importance lies in its ability to provide a challenging platform for evaluating the performance of different algorithms and models.
