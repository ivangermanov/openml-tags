Brilliant Diamonds

Tags: Context

Buying a diamond can be a frustrating and expensive experience. This inspired me to create a dataset to demystify the value of the four Cs: cut, color, clarity, and carat. This dataset contains information on natural and lab-created diamonds from Brilliant Earth, a company committed to ethically sourced jewelry and providing a great shopping experience.

The dataset includes attributes that describe each diamond, including its identification number, URL for the diamond details page, shape, price in US dollars, carat weight, cut quality, color grade, clarity grade, diamond certificate or grading report, type (natural or lab-created), and the date the data was fetched.

The shape of a diamond refers to its external geometric appearance. The price is the cost of the diamond in US dollars. The carat weight is a unit of measurement used to describe the weight of a diamond. The cut of a diamond refers to its facets, symmetry, and reflective qualities. The color grade is based on the GIA grade scale and describes the natural color or lack of color visible within a diamond. The clarity grade describes the visibility of natural microscopic inclusions and imperfections within a diamond.

The dataset aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the four Cs and their impact on the value of a diamond. By analyzing this data, one can gain insights into the factors that affect the price of a diamond and make informed purchasing decisions.
