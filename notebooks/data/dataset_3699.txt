Overwatch Competitions Data - Seven Seasons

Tags: Overwatch is a Team-Based Multiplayer First-Person Shooter Video Game Developed and Published by Blizzard Entertainment.

Described as a Hero Shooter, Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of nearly thirty characters, known as Heroes, each with a unique style of play whose roles are divided into four general categories that fit their role: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support.

Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time.

I discovered this dataset on the Overwatch Subreddit, where a user had recorded every game they played. There is a similar dataset available, which provides valuable insights into Overwatch gameplay.

The data was initially messy, so it was cleaned and formatted to make it easier for visualization and analysis. The columns, including Time, Result, Map, Team Role, Character One, Character Two, Character Three, and Psychological Condition, were transformed into an easy-to-use format.

Features include Date, Season, Game ID, Skill Rating Start, Skill Rating Finish, Skill Rating Delta, Streak Number, Result, My Team Skill Rating, Enemy Team Skill Rating, Team Skill Rating Delta, My Team Members, Enemy Team Members, Map, Round, Capture Score, Score Distance, Time Left, Team Role, Match Length, Characters Played, Communication, Note, Psychological Condition, Eliminations, Objective Kills, Damage, Healing, Deaths, Weapon Accuracy, Offensive Assists, Defensive Assists, and Scoped.
