QSAR-TID-12947 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12947. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1287 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 is a single protein preferred name, also known as CDK5, CDKN5, Cell division protein kinase 5, Cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and Cyclin-dependent-like kinase 5. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase family/CMGC protein kinase CDK5 subfamily.

The dataset is related to Homo sapiens species group, and the protein target classification is 1. Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase CDK family/CMGC protein kinase CDK5 subfamily.

The dataset contains information about the relationship between the target and other proteins, including CDK5 activator 1, Cyclin-dependent kinase, Cyclin-T1/Cyclin-dependent-like kinase 5, and Protein cereblon/Cyclin-dependent-like kinase 5.

The dataset also contains information about the parent molecule, including SELICICLIB, DINACICLIB, and RGB-286638, which are small molecules that inhibit Cyclin-dependent kinase 5.

The dataset is related to various biological processes, including cell cycle, cell division, protein phosphorylation, synaptic transmission, and nervous system development.
