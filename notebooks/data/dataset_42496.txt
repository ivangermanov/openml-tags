This dataset represents crime reported to the Seattle Police Department. Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. This data is the same data used in meetings such as Sea Stat for strategic planning, accountability, and performance management.

For more information, see the Crime Data webpage on the City of Seattle's website. 

In this version, the task was downsized to a random sample of ten percent.

A new target feature, Reported Time, has been computed. Additionally, new date features have been created, certain features have been ignored, and other features have been encoded as categorical variables.

The features included in this dataset are Reported Time, Primary Offense Description, Precinct, Sector, Beat, Neighborhood, Hour of Occurrence, and Minute of Occurrence.
