Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Ada with seed four, arguments nrows max two thousand, ncols max one hundred, nclasses max ten, no stratify false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of columns using a uniform random choice. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data.
