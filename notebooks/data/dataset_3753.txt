QSAR-TID-10436 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10436. The dataset has rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10436. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The dataset is composed of several compounds, each with its corresponding activity value on the drug target TID: 10436. The activity values are represented as pseudo-pCI50, which is a unit of measurement for the potency of a compound. The dataset also includes features such as Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50, which provide additional information about the compounds.

The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is a widely used tool for generating molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing the chemical structure of a molecule as a binary string. The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints are a type of molecular fingerprint that is commonly used in QSAR modeling.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a collaborative effort between several research groups and institutions, and the dataset is one of the many datasets available through the project.
