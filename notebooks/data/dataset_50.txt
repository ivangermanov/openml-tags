Tic Tac Toe Endgame Dataset

Tags: mythbusting, OpenML CC, OpenML, study, uci

This dataset encodes the complete set of possible board configurations at the end of tic tac toe games, where "x" is assumed to have played first. The target concept is "win for x" (i.e., true when "x" has one of eight possible ways to create a "three in a row").

Attribute Information:
Each square on the tic tac toe board is represented by one of three values:
- x: player x has taken this square
- o: player o has taken this square
- b: the square is blank

The squares are represented in the following order:
Top left, top middle, top right, middle left, middle middle, middle right, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right

The final attribute is the Class, which can be either positive or negative.

This dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in 1991. It is part of several studies and is included in the OpenML CC and OpenML datasets.

The dataset does not contain any missing values. It provides a comprehensive representation of all possible end game states in tic tac toe, making it useful for machine learning tasks related to game outcome prediction and strategy analysis.

Researchers using this dataset should cite the UCI Machine Learning Repository according to their citation policy.
