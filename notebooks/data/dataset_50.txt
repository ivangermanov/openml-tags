Ionosphere Database 

Tags: Chemistry, Machine Learning, Mythbusting, Study 

This radar data was collected by a system located in Goose Bay, Labrador. The system consists of a phased array of sixteen high frequency antennas with a total transmitted power of approximately six point four kilowatts. For more detailed information, please refer to the relevant paper.

The received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number. There were seventeen pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system. Instances in this database are described by two attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic signal. 

The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. Good radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. Bad returns are those that do not; their signals pass through the ionosphere.

Classification of Radar Returns from the Ionosphere Using Neural Networks is a relevant paper that provides more information about this topic.

Features:

* Thirty-four continuous attributes 
* One binary classification attribute, which is either good or bad according to the definition summarized above.
