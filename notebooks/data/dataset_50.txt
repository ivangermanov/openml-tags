The Tic Tac Toe dataset is a collection of data that encodes the complete set of possible board configurations at the end of Tic Tac Toe games, assuming player X makes the first move. The target concept is whether player X has won the game, which occurs when they have one of eight possible ways to create a three-in-a-row.

This dataset contains ten attributes that describe the state of the Tic Tac Toe board. These attributes include the top left square, top middle square, top right square, middle left square, middle middle square, middle right square, bottom left square, bottom middle square, and bottom right square. Each of these attributes can take on one of three values: X, O, or blank, indicating which player has placed a mark in that square or if the square is empty.

The class attribute indicates whether the board configuration represents a win for player X or not. This attribute takes on one of two values: positive, indicating a win for X, or negative, indicating a loss or draw.

The dataset does not contain any missing values.

Additional information about this dataset includes the fact that the estimated relative performance values were calculated using a linear regression method. Further details on this calculation can be found in the original article.
