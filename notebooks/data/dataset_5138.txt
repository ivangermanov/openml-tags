Timing Attack Dataset: Thirty Micro Seconds Delay Created on September Twentieth, Two Thousand Twenty-Two

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

Bleichenbacher Timing Attack: This dataset was created to analyze the behavior of encrypted data packets during a Bleichenbacher timing attack. The attack takes advantage of the differences in processing time between different encryption operations to deduce the contents of encrypted data.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset contains attributes related to three types of network packets: Change Cipher Spec TCP Acknowledgement, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect.

The attributes for each type of packet include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and order.

The flags attribute includes reserved flag, nonce flag, congestion window reduced flag, ECN echo flag, urgent flag, acknowledgment flag, push flag, reset flag, syn flag, and fin flag.

The dataset also includes labels and vulnerable classes.
