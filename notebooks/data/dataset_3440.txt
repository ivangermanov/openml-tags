QSAR-TID-101269 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101269. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the BR serine/threonine-protein kinase one, which is a single protein target. This protein is also known as Brain-Selective Kinase One, Brain-Specific Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase One, and BRSK One.

The BR serine/threonine-protein kinase one is a protein that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group, CAMK one family, and BRSK subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle, DNA damage response, and neurotransmitter secretion.

The protein is expressed in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, centrosome, microtubule organizing center, and cytoskeleton. It is also involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neuron projection development, and axonogenesis.
