Shark Tank Pitches

Acknowledgement: Thanks to The Concept Center for publishing this article, an analysis, and pulling the data.

Background: Shark Tank is an ABC show where entrepreneurs from around the United States can pitch their innovative ideas to a panel of billionaires. The show originated in Japan in 2009 and has gained immense popularity over the years, becoming what it is today.

For this study, it was thought-provoking to take the six seasons of Shark Tank, consisting of numerous episodes and companies, to see which ones performed exceptionally well and asked for the most investment. Additionally, it was intriguing to explore if there are any trends when it comes to those companies securing a deal with at least one shark.

Which of the Shark Tank companies will be the most successful? Let us delve into the data to uncover what insights we can find.

Data: The data was collected from Shark Analytics, which aggregated the information into a single, comprehensive area.

The dataset features include deal information, company descriptions, episode details, categories, entrepreneur information, locations, websites, investment amounts, exchange rates for stakes, valuations, season numbers, and shark investors.

The goal is to identify the most successful Shark Tank companies and uncover any trends in securing deals with the sharks.
