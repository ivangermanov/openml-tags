Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete with seed equal to four, arguments number of rows maximum equal to two thousand, arguments number of columns maximum equal to one hundred, arguments number of classes maximum equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice based on the value counts of the classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly and subsets it using a train test split.
