Indian News Articles

It is always fascinating to analyze what is happening in the news, but unfortunately, there is no good data available in the Indian context on Kaggle, so I took the initiative to create one.

The dataset contains not only the main content of the articles but also additional information such as the source, category, link, publication date, header, subheader, and content.

I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of Python and the BeautifulSoup library, as well as Firstpost.com, for making this dataset possible.

The inspiration behind this dataset is the realization that data is not always readily available to us, and sometimes we need to take the initiative to create our own.

Features: source, category, link, publication date, header, subheader, content

Keywords: Indian news, data analysis, dataset creation, news articles, data availability.
