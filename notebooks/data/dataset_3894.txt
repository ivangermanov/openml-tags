QSAR-TID-101613
Tags: Health, Medicine, MTLQSAR, study 3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101613. It has ninety-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systèmes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was taken from the metaqsar project in september two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it for your research purposes.

The molecule chembl id is an identifier for each molecule in the dataset. The median pxc fifty is a measure of the activity of each compound.

The fingerprints are a way of representing molecular structures numerically. They are used in machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds.

The dataset was created using the pipeline pilot program, which is a software tool for generating molecular fingerprints. The smiles strings were used as input for the program.

The dataset contains ninety-six compounds with their corresponding activity values and fingerprints. It can be used for building machine learning models to predict the activity of new compounds.
