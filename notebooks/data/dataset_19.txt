Mushroom Dataset 

Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning, Mythbusting 

This dataset describes mushrooms in terms of their physical characteristics. They are classified into either poisonous or edible.

The dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to twenty-three species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. 

The dataset was created based on The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms. The guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
