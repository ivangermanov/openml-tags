The dataset Fabert Seed Four Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True belongs to the categories of Demographics and Statistics. This dataset is a subsampling of the original Fabert dataset.

This dataset was generated using a Python function called subsample, which takes several arguments, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and whether to perform stratified sampling.

The function first selects a uniform sample of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that all classes are represented. It then selects a uniform sample of columns from the dataset, if necessary. Finally, it performs stratified sampling on the remaining data points to ensure that the resulting dataset has the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset contains a subset of the original features, including various demographic variables.
