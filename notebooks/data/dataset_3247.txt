QSAR-TID-12366 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12366. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Hepatitis C virus polyprotein, which is a single protein target. The virus is a member of the Flaviviridae family and is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. The polyprotein is a complex protein that plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle, and its inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of Hepatitis C.

The dataset provides information about the protein target classification, including its description, relationship, and accession genome. It also includes information about the protein's function, including its role in the viral life cycle, its interaction with host cells, and its involvement in various biological processes.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs and therapies for the treatment of Hepatitis C. It provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data that can be used to identify potential drug candidates and to optimize their activity and selectivity.
