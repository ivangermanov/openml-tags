To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model, a modified version of RFM, this study adopted the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes its blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin Chu City to gather blood donations approximately every three months. 

To build an FRMTC model, seven hundred forty-eight donors were randomly selected from the donor database. Each of these seven hundred forty-eight donor data included recency, which is the time period in months since the last donation, frequency, which is the total number of donations, monetary, which is the total amount of blood donated in cubic centimeters, time, which is the time period in months since the first donation, and a binary variable representing whether the individual donated blood in March two thousand seven. 

This binary variable is represented by one if the individual donated blood and zero if they did not donate blood. The Blood Transfusion Service Center is a classification problem.

The variables are described below. 
Recency is a quantitative variable measured in months, which represents the time period since the last donation. 
Frequency is also a quantitative variable, which measures the total number of donations made by an individual.
Monetary is another quantitative variable, which represents the total amount of blood donated by an individual in cubic centimeters.
Time is a quantitative variable measured in months, which represents the time period since the first donation.

Table One displays the descriptive statistics of the data. 
Five hundred data points were randomly selected as the training set, and the remaining two hundred forty-eight were used as the testing set.
