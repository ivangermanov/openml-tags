A Collection of Tweets and Features 

This dataset contains a collection of tweets in Dutch, along with their corresponding features, gathered in April using the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API). A small portion of these tweets have been annotated by volunteer annotators. The primary objective of this dataset is to identify which of these tweets are rumors, based on the provided features and labeled examples.

Tweet Features 

The features associated with each tweet include the follower count, which represents the number of users following the account; the total number of tweets posted by the account; the presence of question marks in the tweet; whether the account is verified or not; the age of the account at the time of posting; the follower-to-following ratio of the account; the presence of exclamation marks; the ratio of capital to lowercase letters in the tweet; the total number of retweets on the tweet; the presence of the hashtag symbol; the total number of users the account follows; the length of the tweet text; the number of lists the account is included in; the presence of emoticons; the total number of likes on the tweet; the duration between the account creation and the tweet posting; and the overall activity level of the account.

Additionally, each tweet includes its corresponding text, the specific Twitter hashtag it belongs to (#jinek, #vleestaks, or #inflatie), and an upsample group feature that enables sampling of each hashtag-label combination in equal proportions. Each tweet is also assigned a label indicating whether it is a rumor (1), non-rumor (0), or unannotated (-1).
