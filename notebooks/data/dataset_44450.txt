Name: Subsample of the RL Dataset with Two Thousand Rows and Ten Classes

Tags: Subsampling of the RL dataset with a seed value, generated with a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes, using stratified sampling.

This dataset is a subsample of the original RL dataset, generated using a random seed value. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are representative of the overall distribution. The number of classes was limited to ten to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

The columns of the dataset were also uniformly sampled, with a maximum of one hundred columns selected. This was done to reduce the feature space and improve the computational efficiency of the dataset.

The stratified sampling method was used to ensure that the subsample is representative of the original dataset. This involved splitting the data into training and testing sets, with the testing set size limited to two thousand rows.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features and the corresponding class labels. The categorical columns have been converted to string format to ensure compatibility with OpenML.

Features: The dataset includes a range of features, including V One, V Five, V Six, V Eight, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, and V Twenty-Two, as well as the class label.
