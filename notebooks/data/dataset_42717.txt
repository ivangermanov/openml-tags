**Click Prediction Small**

This dataset is derived from the KDD Cup 2012 and is a 0.1% balanced subsample of the original dataset. The data is about advertisements shown alongside search results in a search engine, and whether or not people clicked on these ads. The task is to build the best possible model to predict whether a user will click on a given ad.

A search session contains information on user identification, the query issued by the user, ads displayed to the user, and a target feature indicating whether a user clicked at least one of the ads in this session. The number of ads displayed to a user in a session is called the depth, and the order of an ad in the displayed list is called the position. An ad is displayed as a short text called the title, followed by a slightly longer text called the description, and a URL.

To construct this dataset, each session was split into multiple instances. Each instance describes an ad displayed under a certain setting, including the depth and position. Instances with the same user identification, ad identification, query, and setting are merged. Each ad and each user have some additional properties located in separate data files that can be looked up using identifications in the instances.

The dataset has the following features: Click, which is a binary variable indicating whether a user clicked on at least one ad; URL Hash, which is a hashed URL for anonymity; Ad Identification; Advertiser Identification, which is important because some advertisers consistently optimize their ads, making the title and description of their ads more attractive than those of others; Depth; Position; Query Identification; Keyword Identification; Title Identification; Description Identification; and User Identification.
