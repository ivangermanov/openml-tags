Click Prediction Small Dataset 

Tags: Economics, Human Activities 

This dataset is derived from the KDD Cup competition held in 2012. It is a subsampled version of the original dataset, downsized to contain only 0.1 percent of the original instances. The target feature, which indicates whether a user clicks on an advertisement or not, is reasonably balanced in this dataset, with a ratio of 5 to 1.

The dataset revolves around advertisements displayed alongside search results in a search engine, focusing on whether users click on these ads. Each search session includes information about the user ID, the query issued by the user, the ads displayed to the user, and the target feature indicating whether a user clicked on at least one of the ads in the session.

A search session typically displays multiple ads to a user, and the number of ads displayed is referred to as the depth. The order in which an ad appears in the displayed list is referred to as the position. Each ad consists of a short text known as the title, a slightly longer text known as the description, and a URL referred to as the display URL.

To create this dataset, each session was split into multiple instances. Each instance describes an ad displayed under specific settings, including the depth and position. Instances with the same user ID, ad ID, query, and settings were merged together. Additionally, each ad and user have supplementary properties stored in separate data files, accessible through IDs present in the instances.

The dataset encompasses various features, including:

* Click: a binary variable indicating whether a user clicked on at least one ad
* Impression: the number of search sessions where an ad was displayed to a user who issued a query
* URL Hash: the URL is anonymized for confidentiality purposes
* Advertiser ID: certain advertisers consistently optimize their ads, resulting in more attractive titles and descriptions
* Depth: the number of ads displayed to a user in a session
* Position: the order of an ad in the displayed list
* User ID: a unique identifier for each user
