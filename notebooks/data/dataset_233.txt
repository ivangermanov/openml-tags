This is the Vehicle SensIT combined dataset, retrieved from the LibSVM site. The dataset was created by joining the test and training datasets, relabeling classes one and two as positive and class three as negative, and normalizing each file column-wise.

The normalization process involved setting constant features to zero and removing them due to sparsity. Binary features were normalized by setting the most frequent value to zero and the other to one. Multinary or real features were divided by their standard deviation.

The resulting dataset consists of various features, including Y, which represents the target variable.

The Vehicle SensIT dataset is useful for studying concept drift and machine learning algorithms in the context of transportation.
