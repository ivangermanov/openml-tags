Echocardiogram Data

Source Information:
The dataset was donated by and collected from the Reed Institute.

Past Usage:
The dataset has been used in various studies to predict patient survival after a heart attack. One study applied an exemplar-based learning program to predict survival and achieved an accuracy of eighty-seven correct and twenty-nine incorrect predictions. Another study used a different set of instances and achieved a sixty-one percent accuracy in predicting patient death. A Cox regression application also recorded a sixty percent accuracy in predicting patient death.

Relevant Information:
All patients in the dataset have suffered heart attacks in the past. The goal is to predict from the given variables whether a patient will survive at least one year after the heart attack. The most challenging part of this problem is correctly predicting that a patient will not survive.

Number of Instances:
The dataset contains one hundred thirty-two instances.

Number of Attributes:
The dataset has thirteen numeric-valued attributes.

Attribute Information:
The attributes include the number of months a patient survived, a binary variable indicating whether the patient is still alive, the patient's age at the time of the heart attack, the presence of pericardial effusion, fractional shortening, E-point septal separation, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, wall motion score, wall motion index, a derivative variable, the patient's name, a meaningless group variable, and a binary variable indicating whether the patient was alive at one year.

Missing Attribute Values:
Some attributes have missing values, denoted by a question mark.

Distribution of Attributes:
The distribution of the still-alive attribute is eighty-eight dead and forty-three alive, with one missing value. The distribution of the alive-at-one attribute is fifty patients who were not alive at one year, twenty-four patients who were alive at one year, and fifty-eight missing values.

Features:
The dataset includes attributes related to patient survival, heart condition, and echocardiogram results.
