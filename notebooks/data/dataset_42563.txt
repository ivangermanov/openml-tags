Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With seventy-nine explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

The target variable that you're trying to predict is the Sale Price, which is the property's sale price in dollars.

The dataset includes variables such as:
