Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This dataset was scraped from sa.aqar.fm to gather land information including price, size, street width, and locations. After cleaning the data, duplicates were removed, resulting in a total of rows.

The majority of the lands are located in Riyadh, but there is also a significant number of lands in Jeddah and Khobar. To maintain the integrity of the data, it was decided to keep the dataset in Arabic.

The street width, land size, and price have been converted into numerical values, while any unconvertible values were left as null.
