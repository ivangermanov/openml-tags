Boston Weather Data January 2013 â€“ April 2018 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Having recently relocated to Boston last autumn, I was curious to know whether the severe winter weather I experienced was typical based on historical data or if there were any patterns to when Boston receives heavy snowfall and strong winds.

The dataset comprises daily highs, lows, and averages of temperature, dew point, wind speed, sea-level pressure, and precipitation levels from January first two thousand thirteen to April eighth two thousand eighteen inclusive. All data is publicly accessible in its entirety on the Weather Underground website; however, this compilation of data spanning multiple years is challenging to visualize simultaneously on the Weather Underground site.

I merely cleaned up the data by separating the month and year into distinct columns and condensing the column headers. The entire dataset can be accessed via this link: https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBOS/2018/1/1/DailyHistory.html?reqdb.zip=reqdb.magic=reqdb.wmo=

It would be fascinating to compare this weather data with weather data from other locations to determine if there are any corresponding patterns. Feel free to augment this dataset if you require more updated or historical information!
