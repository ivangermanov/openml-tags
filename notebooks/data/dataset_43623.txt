Boston Weather Data January 2013 - April 2018

Tags: Having just moved to Boston last fall, I was curious to know whether the severe winter weather I experienced was normal based on historical data, or if there are any patterns to when Boston gets heavy snowfall and wind. This dataset contains daily weather data, including highs, lows, and averages of temperature, dew point, wind speeds, sea level pressure, and precipitation levels, from January 1, 2013, to April 8, 2018. All data is publicly available in its entirety on the Weather Underground website; however, it is difficult to see all the data at once on the website. I simply cleaned up the data by breaking out the month and year into their own columns and condensing the column headers. The data can be found on the Weather Underground website.

It would be interesting to see this weather data compared with weather data from other locations to see if there are any corresponding patterns. Feel free to augment this dataset if you need more updated information or older information!
