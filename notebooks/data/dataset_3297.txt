QSAR-TID-20122 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20122. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20122. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecules as a series of bits. The fingerprints are used to predict the activity of compounds on a particular drug target.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR data. The project is a collaboration between several institutions and provides a platform for researchers to access and share QSAR data.

The dataset contains information about the Prostanoid DP receptor, which is a protein target that is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. The receptor is also involved in the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, male sex determination, sleep, response to lipid, mast cell degranulation, and adenosine metabolic process.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers studying the Prostanoid DP receptor and its role in various biological processes. The QSAR data can be used to predict the activity of compounds on the receptor, which can aid in the development of new drugs.
