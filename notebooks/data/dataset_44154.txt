This is perhaps the best-known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. The data set contains three classes of instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain.

### Attribute Information:

The dataset consists of five attributes: Sepal Length in Centimeters, Sepal Width in Centimeters, Petal Length in Centimeters, Petal Width in Centimeters, and Class. The Class attribute has three possible values: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica.

The instances in this dataset represent individual plants. This dataset is one of the earliest used in the literature on classification methods and is widely used in statistics and machine learning. The data set contains three classes of instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute is the class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain.

This dataset differs from the data presented in the original article. The corrections include errors in the fourth feature of the thirty-fifth sample and errors in the second and third features of the thirty-eighth sample.

This dataset does not have any missing values.
