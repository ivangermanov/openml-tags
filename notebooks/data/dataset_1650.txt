This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101269. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the BR serine/threonine-protein kinase one, also known as brain-selective kinase one or brain-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase one. It is a single protein target that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CAMK protein kinase group/CAMK protein kinase CAMK1 family/CAMK protein kinase BRSK subfamily.

The protein target classification is based on its function as a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, neurotransmitter secretion, and nervous system development. It is expressed in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, centrosome, microtubule organizing center, cytoskeleton, synaptic vesicle, cell junction, and other cellular components.

The dataset provides information on the expression atlas, component ontology, function ontology, process ontology, and other relevant details about the protein target. It also includes cross-references to other databases such as UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PharmGKB.
