QSAR-TID-100871 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100871. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. This dataset is part of the project and contains data from ChEMBL version seventeen. 

The dataset includes multiple compounds with their corresponding activity values and molecular fingerprints. These molecular fingerprints are essential for QSAR modeling, as they describe the structural properties of molecules. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. This makes the dataset suitable for machine learning-based QSAR modeling approaches.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple molecular fingerprint features.
