Yeast Dataset with Partial Label Ranking Tags

This dataset contains features such as attributes one through eight, and localization labels one through ten. The dataset provides information about the localization site of proteins, which is a non-numeric attribute.

The dataset is a successor to a previous version, which was described in references that also provide results for classification by a rule-based expert system. These results, however, are not cross-validated.

The previous version of the dataset was used to develop an expert system for predicting protein localization sites in gram-negative bacteria. This system was later expanded to create a knowledge base for predicting protein localization sites in eukaryotic cells.

The dataset does not contain any missing values.

Keywords: yeast, protein localization, gram-negative bacteria, eukaryotic cells, expert system, knowledge base.
