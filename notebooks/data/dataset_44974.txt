**Video Transcoding**

**Data Description**
The dataset contains a large number of randomly sampled video instances, each with ten fundamental video characteristics, along with the YouTube video ID. The videos were all transcribed from one format into another, measuring the memory usage and the transcription time. The goal is to predict the transcription time using the input information and the desired output format.

**Attribute Description**
The dataset includes the following attributes:

* YouTube Video ID (which should be dropped for the analysis)
* Duration of the video
* Coding standard used for the video (such as MPEG4, H264, VP8, or FLV)
* Width of the video in pixels
* Height of the video in pixels
* Video bitrate
* Actual video frame rate
* Number of I frames in the video
* Number of P frames in the video
* Number of B frames in the video
* Total number of frames in the video
* Total size in bytes of I frames
* Total size in bytes of P frames
* Total size in bytes of B frames
* Total size of the video
* Output codec used for transcoding
* Output bitrate used for transcoding
* Output frame rate used for transcoding
* Output width in pixels used for transcoding
* Output height in pixels used for transcoding
* Total codec allocated memory for transcoding (alternate target feature)
* Total transcoding time for transcoding (target feature)

**Scraped Data**
The dataset is composed of two files: 'youtube_videos.tsv' and 'transcoding_measurement.tsv'. The first file contains ten columns of fundamental video characteristics for a large number of YouTube videos, including YouTube video ID, duration, bitrate, height, width, frame rate, estimated frame rate, codec, category, and direct video link. This dataset can be used to gain insight into the characteristics of consumer videos found on user-generated content platforms like YouTube.

The second file contains twenty columns, including input and output video characteristics, along with their transcoding time and memory resource requirements while transcoding videos to different but valid formats. This dataset was collected based on experiments on an Intel i7-3720QM CPU, where two rows were randomly picked from the first dataset and used as input and output parameters of a video transcoding application, FFmpeg.
