MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-12724
Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12724. It consists of one thousand two hundred fifty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes various molecular fingerprints, such as FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints are used to describe the chemical structure of molecules.

The dataset is related to the Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase Alpha Three, which is a single protein target classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase belonging to the CAMK protein kinase group and CAMK protein kinase RSKb family. It is primarily found in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, cytoplasm, cytosol, and synapse.

The protein plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including skeletal system development, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, signal transduction, chemical synaptic transmission, central nervous system development, and phosphorylation.
