House 16H Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

This database was designed on the basis of data provided by the US Census Bureau, specifically from the Summary Tape File One. The data were collected as part of the 1990 US census. These are mostly counts cumulated at different survey levels. For the purpose of this data set, a level State-Place was used. Data from all states was obtained. Most of the counts were changed into appropriate proportions.

There are four different data sets obtained from this database, all concerned with predicting the median price of the house in the region based on demographic composition and a state of housing market in the region. The datasets are House Eight High, House Eight Low, House Sixteen High, and House Sixteen Low. The number in the name signifies the number of attributes of the dataset. A following letter denotes a very rough approximation to the difficulty of the task. For Low task difficulty, more correlated attributes were chosen as signified by univariate smooth fit of that input on the target. Tasks with High difficulty have had their attributes chosen to make the modeling more difficult due to higher variance or lower correlation of the inputs to the target.

The original source of this dataset is the DELVE repository of data, which is a collection of regression datasets.

Characteristics of this dataset include twenty-two thousand seven hundred eighty-four cases and seventeen continuous attributes.
