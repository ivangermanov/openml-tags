Customer churn occurs when customers abandon their current service provider and switch to another one. This poses a significant business problem since acquiring new customers is more costly than retaining existing ones. The following challenge serves as a precursor to the all-expense-paid boot camp/hackathon, focusing on developing robust models to predict and prevent customer churn.

To facilitate this task, we provide an academic dataset featuring classified customers who might churn. Note that a balanced dataset has been utilized for this purpose. The included features encompass:

customer ID, age of network subscription, tenure duration in months, cumulative expenditure during the first two months of the year, SMS spending, data consumption expenditure, total data usage, unique call counts, expenditure on on-net services, off-net services, complaint calls to the call center, network type subscribed during the initial month, network type subscribed during the second month, preferred competitor network during the initial month, and preferred competitor network during the second month, as well as the eventual churn status.
