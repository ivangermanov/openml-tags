COVID-19 Indonesia Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

The COVID-19 dataset in Indonesia was created to explore various factors that could be considered in decision-making related to the level of stringency in each province in Indonesia, taking into account the complexities of the pandemic.

Content

The dataset is compiled based on time-series data, encompassing both national-level data for Indonesia as a whole, as well as provincial-level data, with some data also provided at the city or regency level where necessary.

In addition to COVID-19 pandemic data, demographic data is also included, along with calculations that examine the relationships between demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic data.
