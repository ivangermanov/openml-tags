Name: OkCupid Stem

Tags: Subsampling of the OkCupid Stem dataset with stratification

This dataset is a subsample of the original OkCupid Stem dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, followed by uniformly sampling columns and rows. The goal was to create a smaller, more manageable dataset while maintaining the overall characteristics of the original data.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done to reduce the number of classes to a more manageable number, while ensuring that the selected classes were representative of the original data. The classes were selected using a random sampling method, with the probability of selection based on the frequency of each class in the original dataset.

Once the classes were selected, the dataset was filtered to include only the rows where one of the selected classes was present. This resulted in a smaller dataset with a reduced number of rows.

Next, the columns of the dataset were sampled uniformly to reduce the number of features. This was done to simplify the dataset and reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were sampled uniformly to reduce the number of samples. This was done using a stratified sampling method, which ensured that the selected samples were representative of the original data.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, including age, body type, diet, and others. The dataset is designed to be a more manageable version of the original OkCupid Stem dataset, while still maintaining the overall characteristics of the data.
