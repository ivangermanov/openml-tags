This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-11863, falls under the categories of Computer Systems, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR. It was part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 11863. There are seventy rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. 

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID, along with numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.

The data is related to the serotonin one a receptor, also known as the five hydroxytryptamine receptor one A. This receptor is a single protein found in the species Mus musculus, specifically classified as a membrane receptor belonging to family A G protein-coupled receptor. 

It is involved in various biological processes, including behavioral fear response, signal transduction, and neurotransmitter receptor activity. The receptor is also associated with certain cellular components, such as the plasma membrane, membrane, and dendrite.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, serotonin receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, neurotransmitter receptor activity.
