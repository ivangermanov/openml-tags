This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex Australian Dollar/Japanese Yen pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a single daily candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is closed during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent day relative to the mean high price of the current day. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean high price is anticipated to increase on the following day, and false if it is expected to decrease or remain stagnant.
