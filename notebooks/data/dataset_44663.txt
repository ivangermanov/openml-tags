First Order Theorem Proving Seed Zero Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the First Order Theorem Proving dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a random seed of zero, a maximum number of rows, a maximum number of columns, and a maximum number of classes. Additionally, the stratification argument was set to true.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, followed by selecting the indices where one of the chosen classes was present. This resulted in a reduced dataset with a specified number of rows.

Furthermore, the columns were also uniformly sampled, resulting in a final dataset with a specified number of columns.

This dataset is particularly relevant to the fields of economics and machine learning, where theorem proving and dataset subsampling are important concepts.
