sf-police-incidents Tags: Incident reports from the San Francisco Police Department between January two thousand three and May two thousand eighteen, provided by the City and County of San Francisco. The dataset was downloaded on May eleventh, two thousand eighteen, from https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-two thousand three/tmnf-yvry. For a description of all variables, check out the homepage of the data provider. The original data was published under Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License. As target, the binary variable Violent Crime was created. A Violent Crime was defined as Category belonging to Assault, Robbery, Sex Offenses Forcible, or Kidnapping, or Descript belonging to Grand Theft Purse Snatch or Attempted Grand Theft Purse Snatch. Additional date and time features, including Hour, Day of the Week, Month, and Year, were created. The original variables, including Category, Descript, Date, Time, Resolution, Location, and Police Department Identification, were removed from the dataset. One record, which contained the only missing value in the variable Police District, was removed from the dataset. Using this dataset for machine learning was inspired by a blog post about modeling tricks, specifically impact coding of categorical variables with many levels. Note that incidents consist of multiple rows in the dataset when the crime belongs to more than one Category, which is indicated by the Identification variable Incident Number, ignored by default. Features include Incident Number, Hour, Day of the Week, Month, Year, Police District, Address, X Coordinate, Y Coordinate, and Violent Crime.
