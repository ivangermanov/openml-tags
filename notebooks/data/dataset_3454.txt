QSAR-TID-12744 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12744. The dataset has fifty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Alpha-2a Adrenergic Receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as Adra2a, Alpha-2A Adrenergic Receptor, Alpha-2A Adrenoceptor, and Alpha-2A Adrenoreceptor.

The Alpha-2a Adrenergic Receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor family. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, smooth muscle contraction, and regulation of vasoconstriction.

The receptor is also associated with various diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, and depression. It is a target for various drugs, including antihypertensives and antidepressants.
