Candy Crush Saga is a highly popular mobile game developed by King, part of Activision Blizzard, that is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. The game is structured as a series of levels where players need to match similar candies together to hopefully clear the level and continue progressing on the level map.

The game has an enormous collection of levels, and new ones are constantly being added. It is essential to strike the perfect balance between level difficulty and player engagement. If the levels are too easy, the game becomes monotonous, while if they are too challenging, players may become frustrated and lose interest.

The Candy Crush dataset provides valuable insights into player behavior, featuring information such as player identification, date and time of play, level details, number of attempts made, and number of successful completions.
