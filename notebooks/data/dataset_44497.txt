Machine Learning Dataset: Numerai Twenty Eight Point Six 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Numerai Twenty Eight Point Six dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters and algorithms. The goal of this subsampling process is to create a smaller, more manageable dataset that retains the essential characteristics of the original.

The subsampling process involves several key steps. First, the algorithm uniformly samples classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the resulting dataset has a representative distribution of classes. This is achieved by selecting a specified number of classes using a random number generator, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class in the original dataset.

Next, the algorithm uniformly samples columns from the original dataset, retaining only a specified number of columns. This is done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and eliminate redundant or irrelevant features.

Finally, the algorithm applies stratified sampling to select a specified number of rows from the resulting dataset, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets using a stratified approach, which helps maintain the balance of classes in the sampled dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, which are denoted as attributes zero through twenty-one. These attributes are numerical and do not have descriptive names.
