Indian News Articles 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

It is always fascinating to analyze what is happening in the news, but unfortunately, there is no good quality data available in an Indian context on Kaggle, which prompted me to create one.

The content of this dataset includes not only the main article text but also provides supplementary information such as the author, link to the original article, publication date, and more.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the creators of Python, BeautifulSoup Library, and FirstPost.com for their invaluable contributions.

The inspiration behind creating this dataset lies in the fact that sometimes we do not have access to the data we need, and therefore, it becomes necessary to create our own. This is my humble attempt to do just that.

This dataset comprises of several features including the source of the article, its category, link, publication date, header, subheader, and content.
