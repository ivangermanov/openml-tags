Bank Eight FM is a family of datasets synthetically generated from a simulation of how bank customers choose their banks. The tasks associated with this dataset are based on predicting the fraction of bank customers who leave the bank due to full queues.

The Bank Eight FM dataset is generated from a simplistic simulator, which simulates the queues in a series of banks. This simulator was explicitly constructed with the purpose of generating a family of datasets for DELVE, a project focused on exploring machine learning algorithms.

Customers in this simulated environment come from several residential areas and choose their preferred bank based on distances. They also have tasks of varying complexity and various levels of patience. Each bank has multiple queues that open and close according to demand, and the tellers have different levels of effectiveness. If a customer's patience expires, they may change queues.

In the rejection protocol tasks, the objective is to predict the rate of rejections, which refers to the fraction of customers who are turned away from the bank because all the open tellers have full queues.

This dataset contains a large number of cases and nine continuous attributes.
