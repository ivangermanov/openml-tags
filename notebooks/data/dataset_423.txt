This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies include research on carbolenes, melting point prediction, neighborhood behavior for molecular diversity descriptors, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, quantitative structure-activity relationships, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro- and bromo-alkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, stability of purposely modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The datasets cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, including melting points, toxicity, biodegradability, enzyme activity, and drug efficacy. Various computational methods are employed, such as artificial neural networks, QSAR modeling, and multivariate pattern recognition. The studies span different areas of medicinal chemistry, environmental science, and biochemistry.

These datasets provide valuable resources for researchers in drug design, toxicology, and computational chemistry. They allow for the development and validation of predictive models, exploration of structure-activity relationships, and investigation of molecular properties relevant to drug discovery and environmental impact assessment.
