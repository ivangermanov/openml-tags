This is one of forty-one drug design datasets. The datasets with one thousand one hundred forty-three features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies.

The dataset Carbolenes is formed using data from the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. The dataset MTP Two is formed using data from the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science.

Other datasets are taken exactly from their original studies. These include Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two.

These datasets were originally published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. The dataset MTP was originally published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Model.
