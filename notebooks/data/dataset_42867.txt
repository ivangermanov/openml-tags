This dataset was created for the purpose of testing classification models. It contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy, but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of thirteen constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The dataset has thirteen continuous attributes, including alcohol, malic acid, ash, alkalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, and proline. In a classification context, this is a well-posed problem with well-behaved class structures, making it a good dataset for first testing of a new classifier, although not very challenging.

There are no missing values in the dataset. It is recommended to standardize the variables for certain uses, such as with classifiers that are not scale-invariant.
