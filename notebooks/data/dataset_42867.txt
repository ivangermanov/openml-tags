Wine Label Ranking

The dataset was created for testing purposes. 

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of thirteen constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 

The attributes are: alcohol, malic acid, ash, alcalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, and proline. 

In a classification context, this is a well-posed problem with well-behaved class structures. A good dataset for first testing of a new classifier, but not very challenging. 

The dataset does not have missing values. 

All attributes are continuous. No statistics are available, but it is suggested to standardize variables for certain uses, such as for use with classifiers that are not scale invariant.
