Water Stress Dataset for Indian Variety of Wheat Crop:

This dataset consists of a file system-based data of Raj 3765 variety of wheat. Twenty-four chlorophyll fluorescence images were captured every alternative day under control and drought conditions over a period of sixty days. A total of five hundred ninety-four images were used for this research work.

The dataset comprises images of wheat crops using Chlorophyll Fluorescence modality, which is further used to identify drought water stress at the canopy level in wheat crops with the help of image processing algorithms.

The images were analyzed using twenty-three texture Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features to extract features related to water stress identification. These features include Autocorrelation, Contrast, Correlation, Cluster Prominence, Cluster Shade, Dissimilarity, Energy, Entropy, Homogeneity, Maximum Probability, Sum of Squares, Sum Average, Sum Variance, Sum Entropy, Difference Variance, Difference Entropy, Information Measure of Correlation One, Information Measure of Correlation Two, Inverse Difference, Inverse Difference Normalized, and Inverse Difference Moment Normalized.

These variables underwent various statistical processes to identify the key detection variables most suited for water stress, which in turn helped build a Root Cause Analysis model for water stress. The dataset was produced using MATLAB GLCM libraries.
