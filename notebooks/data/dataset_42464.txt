Waterstress Tags: supervised classification

The Water Stress dataset for Indian variety of wheat crop consists of a file system-based data of Raj 3765 variety of wheat. Twenty-four chlorophyll fluorescence images were captured every alternative day, under control and drought conditions, for a period of sixty days. A total of images are used for this research work. This dataset comprises of images of wheat crop using Chlorophyll Fluorescence modality, which is further used to identify drought water stress at canopy level in the wheat crop with the help of Image Processing algorithms.

The dataset includes various texture features extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) libraries in MATLAB. These features are Autocorrelation, Contrast, Correlation, Cluster Prominence, Cluster Shade, Dissimilarity, Energy, Entropy, Homogeneity, Maximum Probability, Sum of Squares Variance, Sum Average, Sum Variance, Sum Entropy, Difference Variance, Difference Entropy, Information Measure of Correlation One, Information Measure of Correlation Two, Inverse Difference, Inverse Difference Normalized, and Inverse Difference Moment Normalized.

These variables underwent various statistical processes to identify the key detection variables suited best for water stress, which in turn help to build a root cause analysis model for water stress. The dataset has been produced using MATLAB GLCM libraries.
