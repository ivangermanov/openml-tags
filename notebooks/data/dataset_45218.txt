The Andes Bayesian Network is a large and complex network consisting of two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, with a total of one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, and the average degree is three point zero three. The maximum in-degree of the network is six.

This network is a representation of an online student modeling system for coached problem solving, which uses Bayesian networks to model student behavior and provide personalized feedback.

The network features a wide range of variables, including student goals, problem solving strategies, and knowledge components. These variables are interconnected to represent the complex relationships between student behavior, problem solving, and learning outcomes.

Keywords: Bayesian network, student modeling, problem solving, online learning, personalized feedback.
