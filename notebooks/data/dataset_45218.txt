Andes Bayesian Network Sample 10.

The Andes Bayesian network repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes, specifically two hundred twenty-three, and an even larger number of arcs, totaling three hundred thirty-eight. Additionally, there are one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters within this complex system.

The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, while the average degree is around three point zero three. The maximum in-degree of any given node is six.

On-line student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks was the primary focus of this research.

Features include goal-oriented nodes, resolution nodes, choose nodes, identify nodes, and many others.
