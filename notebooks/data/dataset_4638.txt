Machine Learning and Medicine Dataset: First Order Theorem Proving 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original First Order Theorem Proving dataset. It has undergone several transformations to reduce its size while maintaining its integrity.

The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset. Since there were more classes than the maximum allowed, a selection was made based on their frequency of occurrence. This ensured that the most common classes were retained.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled to reduce their number. A random selection of column indices was made, and only those columns were retained. 

Finally, the rows were also reduced in number using stratified sampling. This method ensured that the class distribution was maintained even after reducing the number of rows.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, including variables one through fifty-one, and a class label.
