Blogger Dataset 

In this study, we aim to identify the causes of user tendencies towards cyberspace in Kohkiloye and Boyer Ahmad Province in Iran. To collect information and form a database, we employed a questionnaire that was administered orally, in written form, and through a programmed website featuring an internet questionnaire. Participants were free to answer the questions at their convenience, providing information about the websites, blogs, and social networks they visited throughout the day. After gathering the questionnaires, we collected the web addresses to obtain the expected results. Finally, we analyzed the participants' trustworthiness by examining their used web pages. Since the results were consistent, we opted to refine our responses by putting them into a database.

We considered several parameters as questions, including age, education, political attitudes, blog topics, and the type of online identity. Additionally, we explored the influence of managerial inefficiency, ineffective media, social and political conditions, and poverty in the province on user tendencies. However, the presence of noisy or overly detailed data in the database hindered our ability to obtain proper and suitable algorithmic answers.

To address this issue, we preprocessed the data and eliminated non-relevant information. Ultimately, we identified the following key fields: education, political inclinations, topics, local media turnover, and local, political, and social space. The collected data are presented in Table One.

To arrive at accurate answers, we categorized bloggers into two groups: professional bloggers and seasonal bloggers. Professional bloggers are individuals who adopt blogging as an effective digital medium and engage in digital writing over continuous time intervals. Seasonal bloggers, on the other hand, are non-professionals who engage in blogging over discrete time periods. In this study, we reviewed the tendency factors, taking into account whether participants belonged to the group of professional bloggers, and subsequently considered other factors accordingly.
