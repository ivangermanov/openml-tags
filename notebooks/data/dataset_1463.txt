Data Set Information:
This paper aims to identify the reasons why users are drawn to cyberspace in Kohkiloye and Boyer Ahmad Province, Iran. The database was compiled using questionnaires distributed orally, in writing, and through a website featuring an online survey. Participants were asked to list the websites, blogs, and social networks they used throughout the day. After collecting the questionnaires, the web addresses were gathered to obtain the expected results. The trustworthiness of the responses was verified by analyzing the visited web pages. As the results were consistent, they were added to the database to ensure better and cleaner data.

Attribute Information:
The questionnaire included parameters such as age, education, political attitudes, blog topics, online identity types, the impact of managerial inefficiency on tendency, the effect of inefficient media on tendency, the influence of social and political conditions on tendency, and the impact of provincial poverty on tendency. To obtain more appropriate and suitable answers from algorithms, the data was preprocessed and non-relevant information was removed. The main fields considered were education, political inclination, topics, local media turnover (LMT), and local, political and social space (LPSS).

For accurate analysis, bloggers were classified into two groups: professional bloggers and seasonal (temporary) bloggers. Professional bloggers are those who adopt blogging as an effective digital media and engage in digital writing consistently over continuous time intervals. Seasonal bloggers are not professionals and pursue blogging sporadically during discrete time periods. The study examines tendency factors while considering whether individuals are professional bloggers (Pro Bloggers, PB) and then evaluates other factors accordingly.
