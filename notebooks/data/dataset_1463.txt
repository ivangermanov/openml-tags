This dataset, named QSAR-TID-11265, is tagged with Images, Machine Learning, and MTLQSAR, and it originates from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

It contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values measured in pseudo-pCI50 units, for numerous compounds acting on the drug target identified as TID 11265. The dataset comprises seven hundred forty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Notably, generating fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset includes the molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty features.

Keywords: QSAR data, machine learning, molecular fingerprints, drug target, pipeline pilot program.
