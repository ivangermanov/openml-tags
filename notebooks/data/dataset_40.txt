This dataset contains sonar signals used to classify metal cylinders (mines) versus roughly cylindrical rocks. The task is to train a neural network to discriminate between these two types of sonar returns. The data was collected by bouncing sonar signals off objects at various angles and under different conditions.

The dataset consists of two files: one containing patterns from metal cylinders and another with patterns from rocks. Each pattern is represented by sixty numbers ranging from zero to one, corresponding to the energy within particular frequency bands integrated over time. The signals were obtained from various aspect angles, covering ninety degrees for cylinders and one hundred eighty degrees for rocks.

The label for each record indicates whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M). While the numbers in the labels are ordered by increasing aspect angle, they do not directly encode the angle.

This dataset can be used to test various aspects of machine learning, including learning speed, quality of ultimate learning, and ability to generalize. Experiments were conducted using both aspect-angle independent and aspect-angle dependent approaches. The aspect-angle independent method involved randomly dividing the data into training and testing sets, while the aspect-angle dependent method attempted to balance the distribution of aspect angles between sets.

A standard backpropagation neural network was employed for all experiments, with varying numbers of hidden units. The network's performance was evaluated on both the training and test sets, with results reported for different network configurations.

Comparisons were made with other classification methods, including a nearest neighbor classifier and human subjects. Trained human subjects achieved accuracy between eighty-eight and ninety-seven percent, though they may have had access to additional information from the raw sonar signal not present in the processed dataset.

This dataset provides valuable insights into sonar signal classification and the effectiveness of neural networks in distinguishing between mines and rocks based on sonar returns.
