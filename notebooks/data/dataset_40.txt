Sonar Dataset 

Summary: 
This dataset is used to classify sonar signals into either mines or rocks. The task involves training a network to differentiate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

Problem Description:
The dataset consists of two files, sonar mines and sonar rocks. The sonar mines file contains 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various conditions. The sonar rocks file contains 97 patterns obtained from rocks under similar conditions. The transmitted sonar signal is a frequency modulated chirp, rising in frequency. The dataset contains signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning ninety degrees for the cylinder and one hundred eighty degrees for the rock. Each pattern is a set of sixty numbers in the range zero point zero to one point zero. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The integration aperture for higher frequencies occurs later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during the chirp. 

Methodology:
This dataset can be used in a number of different ways to test learning speed, quality of ultimate learning, ability to generalize, or combinations of these factors. The dataset is divided randomly into thirteen disjoint sets with sixteen cases in each. For each experiment, twelve of these sets are used as training data, while the thirteenth is reserved for testing. The experiment is repeated thirteen times so that every case appears once as part of a test set. 

Results:
For the aspect angle independent experiments, the results show that the network's performance on the test set was somewhat better when the aspect angles in the training and test sets were balanced. A nearest neighbor classifier on the same data gave an eighty-two point seven percent probability of correct classification. Three trained human subjects were each tested on one hundred signals, chosen at random from the set of two hundred eight returns used to create this dataset. Their responses ranged between eighty-eight percent and ninety-seven percent correct.
