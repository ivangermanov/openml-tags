A Casebook for a First Course in Statistics and Data Analysis

This dataset is part of a collection used in the book "A Casebook for a First Course in Statistics and Data Analysis," published by John Wiley and Sons, New York. The collection consists of numerous files, each representing a data set analyzed in the book. The file names correspond to those used in the publication.

The data files are written in plain ASCII text format. Missing values are denoted by "M" across all data files. Additional information about the data sets and the book can be accessed via gopher or the World Wide Web using a browser.

These datasets are available for free use in scientific, educational, and non commercial purposes, provided appropriate acknowledgment is given by citing the aforementioned book reference.

The specific file discussed here is health.dat. Attribute names were automatically generated due to lack of information in the data itself. The dataset is classified as numeric with no specific class index.

Features of the dataset include several columns, though their exact names are not human readable and thus not included here.

It is important to note that this dataset, along with others in the collection, serves as a valuable resource for students and researchers in the field of statistics and data analysis. The practical examples provided in these datasets allow for hands on learning and application of statistical concepts.

The availability of such datasets contributes to the advancement of statistical education and research, providing real world examples for students to work with and analyze. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in the field of statistics.
