White Wine

The dataset was collected from May 2004 to February 2007 using only protected designation of origin samples that were tested at the official certification entity, CVRVV. The CVRVV is an inter-professional organization with the goal of improving the quality and marketing of Vinho Verde. The data were recorded by a computerized system, iLab, which automatically manages the process of wine sample testing from producer requests to laboratory and sensory analysis. Each entry denotes a given test, either analytical or sensory. The ultimate goal is to use chemical analysis to determine the quality of the wine.

This version of the dataset contains only the white wine. 

The features include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality, which is the target feature.

The dataset was created for testing purposes. 

Additional information about the dataset reveals that these data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of thirteen constituents found in each of the three types of wines. Unfortunately, the initial dataset had around thirty variables, but for some reason, only the thirteen-dimensional version remains. There is no knowledge about which thirteen variables are included in the set.

All attributes are continuous. There are no missing values in the dataset. It is suggested to standardize variables for certain uses, such as with classifiers that are not scale-invariant.
