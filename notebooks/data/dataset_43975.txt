This dataset, known as Higgs, belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. It is a smaller version of the original dataset, containing one million rows.

The Higgs dataset is related to the detection of the Higgs boson in high-energy physics experiments. The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations.

The dataset consists of twenty-eight features, divided into two categories. The first twenty-one features represent kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. These include properties related to leptons, jets, and missing energy.

The remaining seven features are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. These features are based on the first twenty-one features and include properties related to masses of different particles.

The goal of this dataset is to classify events into two categories: signal and background. The signal category corresponds to the presence of the Higgs boson, while the background category corresponds to other types of interactions.

Deep learning methods can be applied to this dataset to automatically learn relevant features and improve the classification performance.
