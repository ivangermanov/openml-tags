Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Electricity with seed equal to zero, arguments number of rows maximum equal to two thousand, arguments number of columns maximum equal to one hundred, arguments number of classes maximum equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a subsampled dataset. It uses a random number generator with a given seed to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes from the dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, ensuring that the number of columns does not exceed the maximum allowed. If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows, ensuring that the class distribution is preserved.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column names.
