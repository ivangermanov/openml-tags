The dataset focuses on dental health metrics and their changes in response to preventive measures. It examines the effectiveness of different approaches to maintaining oral hygiene and preventing tooth decay across various demographic groups. The inclusion of gender and ethnicity as variables allows for analysis of potential disparities in dental health outcomes and the efficacy of prevention strategies among different populations.
