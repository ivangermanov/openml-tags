The HIVA dataset is a collection of molecules with their corresponding activity levels against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The primary goal of this dataset is to predict which compounds are active against AIDS HIV infection. Initially, the data had three classes: active, moderately active, and inactive; however, we reduced it to a two-class classification problem, focusing on active versus inactive compounds.

We represented the molecules using 2000 sparse binary input variables, each variable representing a specific property inferred from the molecular structure. Therefore, the main challenge is to establish a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) between the molecular structure and its activity, enabling high-throughput screening (HTS) of new compounds without actual testing.

This dataset combines samples from both training and validation sets. The data type is non-sparse, comprising numerous features that describe the molecular properties.

The HIVA dataset is part of the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge, aimed at comparing machine learning approaches with prior knowledge-based methods in solving real-world problems.
