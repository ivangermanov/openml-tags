HIVA is the HIV infection database. The task of HIVA is to predict which compounds are active against the AIDS HIV infection. The original data has three classes (active, moderately active, and inactive). We brought it back to a two-class classification problem (active vs. inactive). We represented the data as sparse binary input variables. The variables represent properties of the molecule inferred from its structure. The problem is therefore to relate structure to activity (a quantitative structure-activity relationship problem) to screen new compounds before actually testing them (a high-throughput screening problem).

Data type: Non-sparse

Number of features: Many

Number of examples and check sum: This dataset contains samples from both training and validation datasets.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes representing various molecular properties.

This dataset focuses on predicting the activity of compounds against HIV infection. It utilizes binary input variables to represent molecular properties, aiming to establish a relationship between chemical structure and biological activity. The challenge lies in effectively screening potential compounds before conducting physical tests, making it valuable for drug discovery and development processes in the fight against AIDS.

The data has been simplified from a three-class problem to a binary classification task, distinguishing between active and inactive compounds. This transformation allows for more straightforward analysis and prediction models. The sparse binary representation of molecular properties enables efficient computational processing and analysis of the chemical structures.

By leveraging this dataset, researchers and data scientists can develop and test machine learning models to predict the effectiveness of new compounds against HIV. This approach has the potential to accelerate the drug discovery process and contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat the AIDS epidemic.
