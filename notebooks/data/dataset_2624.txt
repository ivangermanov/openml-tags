The MIP-2016-regression dataset is a collection of algorithm runtime data for Mixed Integer Programming problems, specifically focused on Regression Analysis. This dataset is part of the Open Algorithm Challenge 2017, also known as "Mira". 

Features of this dataset include Instance Identification, Repetition, Problem Type, Number of Variables, Number of Constraints, Number of Non-Zero Coefficients, and many others related to linear programming, variable characteristics, constraint characteristics, and objective coefficients.

The dataset includes the PAR10 performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of MIPLIB2010, which is a well-known benchmark library for Mixed Integer Programming problems. The algorithm runtime data was taken from the twelve-thread table of the evaluations. 

Features were generated using the MIP feature computation code, and runtimes of the feature computations were recorded using RunSolver.

Keywords: Mixed Integer Programming, Regression Analysis, Algorithm Runtime Data, Linear Programming, Variable Characteristics, Constraint Characteristics, Objective Coefficients.
