QSAR-TID-100067 Dataset: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: One Hundred Thousand Sixty Seven. It has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, molecular fingerprints, and median PXc fifty.
