QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is associated with the MetaQSAR project from September. Please cite this source when using the data.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and numerous FCFP fingerprint bits. The full list of features is extensive, comprising over molecular fingerprint descriptors.

The scraped data provides additional information about the target protein ADAMTS:

ID: CHEMBL
Type: SINGLE PROTEIN
Preferred Name: ADAMTS
Synonyms: ADAMTS, ADAM TS, ADAM TS, ADAMTS, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs
Organism: Homo sapiens
Species Group: No
Protein Target Classification: Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAM clan/Metallo protease MB subfamily

The protein is associated with various Gene Ontology terms related to its cellular component, molecular function, and biological processes. These include extracellular region, metalloendopeptidase activity, proteolysis, and extracellular matrix organization.

Additional database identifiers and cross references are provided, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe entries. The protein is involved in pathways such as degradation of the extracellular matrix and O glycosylation of TSR domain containing proteins.
