The QSAR-TID-100479 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100479. This dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains information about a single protein, ADAMTS one, also known as A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs one. It is an enzyme and a protease that belongs to the metallo protease M twelve B subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including ovulation from ovarian follicle, kidney development, proteolysis, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, negative regulation of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, heart trabecula formation, positive regulation of G one S transition of mitotic cell cycle, and positive regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.

It is located in the extracellular region, basement membrane, extracellular matrix, cytoplasmic vesicle, and collagen-containing extracellular matrix. It has metalloendopeptidase activity, protein binding, heparin binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.

Keywords: QSAR, ADAMTS1, metalloproteinase, thrombospondin, extracellular matrix, proteolysis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, enzyme, protease.
