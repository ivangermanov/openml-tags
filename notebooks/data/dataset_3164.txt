The Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use File provides information on inpatient discharges for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. This file offers a comprehensive overview of the services rendered to these patients during their hospital stays.

The Inpatient Public Use File contains valuable data on utilization, payment, including total payment and Medicare payment, and hospital-specific charges for over three thousand United States hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System payments.

This extensive database is carefully organized by hospital and Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group, covering a range of fiscal years. It offers a wealth of information on various aspects of inpatient care, providing insights into the services provided, costs incurred, and payments made.

Some key details included in this dataset are the definition of diagnosis related groups, provider identification, provider name, street address, city, state, zip code, hospital referral region description, total discharges, average covered charges, average total payments, and average Medicare payments.
