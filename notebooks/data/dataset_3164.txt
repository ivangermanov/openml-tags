Description:
The delta opioid receptor is a G protein coupled receptor involved in pain modulation and other physiological processes. It belongs to the opioid receptor family and is activated by endogenous opioid peptides as well as exogenous opioid drugs. The receptor is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and plays a role in analgesia, mood regulation, and addiction.

Relationships:
The delta opioid receptor is part of several selectivity groups and protein families related to opioid receptors. It has relationships with mu and kappa opioid receptors as part of opioid receptor selectivity groups and families.

Approved Drugs:
Several compounds targeting the delta opioid receptor have reached clinical trials, including agonists and partial agonists. Some examples that have progressed to phase 2 or beyond include axomadol, ADL 5859, ADL 5747, and AZD 7268. Samidorphan, a partial agonist, received FDA approval in 2021.

Gene Ontology:
The delta opioid receptor is associated with numerous cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes according to Gene Ontology annotations. These include localization in neuronal membranes and projections, G protein coupled receptor activity, neuropeptide signaling, pain modulation, and regulation of various cellular processes.
