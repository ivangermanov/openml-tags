Alarm Bayesian Network. Sample 0.

The Alarm Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network has a total number of nodes and arcs, indicating its complexity and interconnectedness. Furthermore, it has a large number of parameters, which highlights its ability to model intricate relationships between variables. The average Markov blanket size and average degree provide insights into the network's structure and density.

The Alarm network was created as a case study to demonstrate the application of probabilistic inference techniques for belief networks. It has been cited in various publications, including the Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.
