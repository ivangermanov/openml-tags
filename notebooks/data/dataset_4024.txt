**QSAR-TID-10142**
**Tags:** MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10142. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty, among others.
