The Weather Problem Dataset: Machine Learning, Statistics 

The weather problem is a tiny dataset that we will utilize repeatedly to exemplify machine learning methods. This entirely fictitious dataset supposedly pertains to the conditions that are conducive for engaging in some unspecified recreational activity or game. Generally speaking, instances within a dataset are characterized by the values of distinct features or attributes, which serve to quantify various aspects of each instance. 

In the context of this particular dataset, there exist four primary attributes: the prevailing atmospheric outlook, the ambient temperature, the level of atmospheric humidity, and the presence or absence of wind. The ultimate outcome or response variable is predicated upon whether the conditions are deemed suitable for engaging in the aforementioned recreational activity or not.

Features: outlook, temperature, humidity, windy, play
