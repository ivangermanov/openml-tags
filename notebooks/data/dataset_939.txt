Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involves calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This binarization technique simplifies the original numeric target into a more straightforward two-class problem, potentially making it easier to analyze and model.

The dataset includes various features that may be used for analysis and prediction. While some feature names are not easily interpretable, they likely represent different attributes or measurements relevant to the study at hand. The binary classification approach allows for clear distinction between two groups within the data, which can be valuable for various analytical and machine learning tasks.
