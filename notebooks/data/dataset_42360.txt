The Daily Electric Energy dataset, also known as DEE, involves predicting the daily average price of electricity energy in Spain. This dataset contains real values from two thousand and three about the daily consumption in Spain of energy from various sources, including hydroelectric, nuclear electric, carbon, fuel, natural gas, and other special sources of energy. Unfortunately, there are missing values in the dataset.

The dataset consists of seven attributes, which are:

One, Hydroelectric, which represents the energy generated from hydroelectric sources.
Two, Nuclear, which represents the energy generated from nuclear electric sources.
Three, Coal, which represents the energy generated from coal sources.
Four, Fuel, which represents the energy generated from fuel sources.
Five, Gas, which represents the energy generated from natural gas sources.
Six, Special, which represents the energy generated from other special sources.
Seven, Consume, which represents the total daily energy consumption.

Keywords: Daily Electric Energy, Electricity Price, Energy Consumption, Spain, Hydroelectric, Nuclear, Coal, Fuel, Natural Gas.
