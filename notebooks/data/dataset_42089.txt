The collection spans over a decade, featuring an extensive repository of reviews up until November of a certain year. Each individual review encompasses comprehensive ratings based on five distinct aspects: the beer's appearance, its aroma, the sensation of the palate, the flavor profile, and the overall impression left on the reviewer. In addition to this, the reviews provide detailed information about the product itself, as well as the user submitting the review. Furthermore, each review includes a brief written description of the reviewer's experience.

The dataset also incorporates reviews sourced from RateBeer, offering a diverse range of perspectives on various beers.
