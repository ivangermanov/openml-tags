This dataset consists of beer reviews from Beer Advocate. The data spans a period of more than a decade, including all reviews up to November of a certain year. Each review includes ratings in terms of five distinct aspects: the beer's appearance, its aroma, the palate, the taste, and the overall impression. Reviews include information about the product and the user, followed by each of these five ratings, and a plaintext review. We also have reviews from Rate Beer.
