Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on plasma retinol levels and various related factors. It has been processed to create a binary classification problem from the original numeric data. The conversion was performed by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N').

The dataset includes a range of features related to health, lifestyle, and dietary habits. These features encompass age, sex, smoking status, body mass index (Quetelet index), vitamin use, caloric intake, fat consumption, fiber intake, alcohol consumption, cholesterol levels, and various measures of beta-carotene and retinol in diet and plasma.

This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for mythbusting studies and research projects that require a simplified, two-class target variable. It allows for easier analysis of factors influencing plasma retinol levels and their potential health implications.
