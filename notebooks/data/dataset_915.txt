The Plasma Retinol dataset has been binarized, converting the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This process involved computing the mean and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset comprises various features, including Age, Sex, Smoking Status, Body Mass Index, Vitamin Use, Caloric Intake, Fat Consumption, Fiber Intake, Alcohol Consumption, Cholesterol Levels, Beta Diet, Retinol Diet, and Beta Plasma levels.
