QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes information on Ephrin type-A receptor, also known as ECK EPHA, Epithelial cell kinase, and Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ECK. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Eph family classification.

The dataset provides details on related compounds such as REGORAFENIB and DASATINIB, which are small molecule inhibitors of Ephrin type-A receptor. These compounds have reached maximum phase in clinical trials and have been approved for use.

Gene ontology information is provided, including cellular components (plasma membrane, focal adhesion, cell surface), molecular functions (nucleotide binding, virus receptor activity, protein kinase activity), and biological processes (skeletal system development, angiogenesis, blood vessel development).

The dataset also includes information from various databases such as ExpressionAtlas, Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, CGD, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
