The Analcatdata Election Dataset has been converted into a binarized version of the original data set. This conversion involves transforming the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean value is calculated and all instances with a lower target value are classified as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all others are classified as Negative, denoted by 'N'.

This dataset encompasses various features, including County, votes for different presidential candidates, and total votes.
