This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. The dataset consists of various chemical features, which are not easily interpretable by humans. The primary purpose of this dataset is for use in machine learning models and other analytical applications.
