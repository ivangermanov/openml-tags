Name: Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed Three

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed with seed equal to three, arguments number of rows max equal to two thousand, arguments number of columns max equal to one hundred, arguments number of classes max equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, number of rows max, number of columns max, number of classes max, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes from the unique values in the target variable. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, it selects the top classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

If the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples columns and subsets the data. If the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to subset the data. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subsetted data, categorical mask, and column names.
