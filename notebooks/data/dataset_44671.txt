Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed Three 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed dataset. It has been generated using a specific set of parameters, including a seed value of three, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling.

The original dataset had a large number of instances, but this subsampled version has been reduced to a more manageable size while still maintaining a representative distribution of classes. This was achieved through a process of uniform sampling, first selecting a subset of classes and then randomly choosing instances from within those classes.

In addition to reducing the number of instances, the dataset has also been filtered to include only a subset of the original features. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and make it more suitable for analysis. The selection of features was performed randomly, but with the goal of preserving a diverse range of characteristics.

The resulting dataset consists of a set of features, each representing a different aspect of the gesture phase segmentation problem. These features have been carefully chosen to provide a comprehensive representation of the underlying phenomenon, and can be used as input to a machine learning algorithm for training and testing.
