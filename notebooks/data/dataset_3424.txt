QSAR-TID-10728 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10728. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset contains a total of one thousand and twenty-six features, including the molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50.

The target protein is the Beta-One Adrenergic Receptor, which is a single protein that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is primarily found in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, heart rate regulation, and smooth muscle contraction.

The receptor is also known by several synonyms, including Adrb One, Adrb One R, Beta-One Adrenergic Receptor, and Beta-One Adrenoceptor. It is a membrane receptor that binds to adrenergic ligands, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, and plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes.
