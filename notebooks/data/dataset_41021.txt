In the early two thousand, the Oakland Athletics were facing a major challenge. They didn't have the luxury of a deep pocket, unlike other teams, but they were still expected to keep up with them. This is where statistics came to the rescue. Billy Beane and his team used data to identify undervalued players who could contribute to the team's success without breaking the bank.

This dataset contains some of the information that was available to the Oakland Athletics in the early two thousand, and it can be used to better understand their methods. The dataset focuses on variables that were deemed important by the team, such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage, which were found to be crucial in scoring runs.

The variables in this dataset include team, league, year, runs scored, runs allowed, wins, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, batting average, playoffs, rank season, rank playoffs, games played, opponent on-base percentage, and opponent slugging percentage.

This dataset is referenced in The Analytics Edge course, which tells the story of Moneyball. The data itself is gathered from baseball-reference.com, one of the most comprehensive sports statistics resources available.
