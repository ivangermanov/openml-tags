The Prnn Viruses dataset consists of sixty-one viruses with rod-shaped particles affecting various crops, including tobacco, tomato, cucumber, and others. This dataset includes eighteen measurements on each virus, which describe the number of amino acid residues per molecule of coat protein.

The dataset is categorized into four groups: Horde Viruses, Tobra Viruses, Toba Movi Viruses, and Furo Viruses. The entire dataset is ordered accordingly, with Horde Viruses first, followed by Tobra Viruses, Toba Movi Viruses, and finally Furo Viruses. The type of virus is included as an additional feature.

Features include multiple columns describing the characteristics of each virus.
