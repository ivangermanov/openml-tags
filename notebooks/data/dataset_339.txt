The objective was to predict pasture production from a variety of biophysical factors. Vegetation and soil variables from areas of grazed North Island hill country with different management (fertilizer application and stocking rate) histories were measured and subdivided into paddocks. Nineteen vegetation (including herbage production), soil chemical, physical and biological, and soil water variables were selected as potentially useful biophysical indicators.

Attribute Information:
fertiliser - fertiliser used - enumerated
slope - slope of the paddock - integer
aspect deviation Northwest - the deviation from the northwest - integer
Olsen Phosphorus - integer
Minimum Nitrogen - integer
Total Sulfur - integer
Calcium Magnesium - calcium magnesium ratio - real
Labile Organic Matter - soil labile organic matter (grams per gram) - real
Nitrogen Fixation mean - a mean calculation - real
Earthworms main species - main species earth worms per square meter - real
Earthworms Number of species - number of species - integer
Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity - millimeters per hour - real
Organic Matter - real
Air Permeability - real
Porosity - real
High Fertility Responsive Grasses percent mean - mean percent - real
legume yield - kilograms of dry matter per hectare - real
Other Species percent mean - mean percent - real
January to March mean Time Domain Reflectometry - real
Annual Mean Runoff - in millimeters - real
root surface area - square meters per cubic meter - real
Leaf Phosphorus - parts per million - real
pasture production class - pasture production categorisation - enumerated
