Bike Sharing Demand

Tags: Machine Learning, Text & Literature

Bike sharing systems represent a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process, from membership to rental and return, has become automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. With over five hundred bike-sharing programs worldwide, comprising more than five hundred thousand bicycles, today there exists significant interest in these systems due to their crucial role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health concerns.

Apart from their intriguing real-world applications, the characteristics of data generated by these systems make them an attractive area of research. Unlike other transportation services, such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature transforms bike sharing systems into virtual sensor networks that can be utilized for sensing urban mobility. Consequently, it is anticipated that most significant events in the city could be detected through monitoring these data.

The core data set relates to a two-year historical log corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012 from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly available. We aggregated the data on a two-hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information was obtained from Freemeteo.

This dataset is highly correlated to environmental and seasonal settings. Factors such as weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and hour of the day can influence rental behaviors. The dataset contains attributes including season, year, month, hour, holiday, day of the week, working day, weather situation, temperature, feeling temperature, humidity, wind speed, casual users, registered users, and total rental bikes.
