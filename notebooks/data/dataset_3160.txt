QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and numerous FCFP fingerprint bits.

The dataset pertains to the C X C chemokine receptor type, also known as CD antigen CD, CXCR, CXC R, and CXCR. This receptor is found in Rattus norvegicus and belongs to the membrane receptor Family A G protein coupled receptor group, specifically the peptide receptor family A GPCR chemokine receptor CXC chemokine receptor classification.

The receptor is associated with various cellular components including the plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, cell surface, and membrane in general. Its functions encompass G protein coupled receptor activity, chemokine receptor activity, C C chemokine receptor activity, C X C chemokine receptor activity, chemokine binding, C C chemokine binding, C X C chemokine binding, and signaling receptor activity.

This receptor is involved in numerous biological processes such as angiogenesis, regulation of leukocyte migration, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, regulation of cell population proliferation, T cell chemotaxis, calcium mediated signaling, regulation of cell adhesion, regulation of angiogenesis, regulation of chemotaxis, regulation of calcium ion release, cell chemotaxis, chemokine mediated signaling pathway, cellular response to organic substances, and regulation of apoptosis execution.

The receptor is referenced in various databases including ExpressionAtlas, canSAR Target, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
