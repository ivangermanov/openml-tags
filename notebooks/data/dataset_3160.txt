This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred three thousand one hundred eleven, and it has sixteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systems BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used for research purposes.
