QSAR-TID-100042 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand forty-two, and it has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent Fingerprints of molecules which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, Fingerprints, and many others.
