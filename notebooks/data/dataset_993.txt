GEMLeR provides a comprehensive collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for the estimation of various quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The necessity for a unified repository of microarray classification problems has been increasingly recognized within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities. This repository aims to address this need by offering a standardized set of problems that can be used by different researchers to compare and evaluate various classification or feature selection techniques.

The origin of the data lies in the large publicly available Expression Project for Oncology repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of the Expression Project for Oncology is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is regularly updated with clinical outcomes and is released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions. This open access to information directly benefits patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

The decision to utilize data from the Expression Project for Oncology repository was driven by several factors, including the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the accessibility of a large number of samples for different tumor types.
