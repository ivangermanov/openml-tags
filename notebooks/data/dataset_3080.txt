QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a tyrosine protein kinase Srms, also known as C orf or SRMS. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TK protein kinase group/tyrosine protein kinase Src family. It is classified as a single protein target.

The tyrosine protein kinase Srms is associated with various cellular components, including the cytoplasm, cytosol, and extrinsic component of the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane. Its functions encompass nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, signaling receptor binding, ATP binding, and transferase activity.

This protein is involved in multiple biological processes such as protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, negative regulation of signal transduction, cell differentiation, peptidyl tyrosine autophosphorylation, and innate immune response.

The dataset provides information on various database cross references for this protein target, including canSAR Target, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro. These references offer additional details on protein domains, families, and functional classifications.

The tyrosine protein kinase Srms contains several important domains, including protein kinase domain, SH domain, serine threonine/tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, and tyrosine kinase active site. These structural elements contribute to its functional properties and interactions within cellular pathways.
