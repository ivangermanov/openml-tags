This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101508, belongs to the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, and MTLQSAR. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, dating back to September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen, showcasing activity values measured in pseudo-pCI50 units for various compounds interacting with the drug target identified as TID: 101508. The dataset comprises five hundred thirty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature denoted as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings utilizing the Pipeline Pilot program developed by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Typically, generating fingerprints does not necessitate missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset pertains to the Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Srms, also known as C20orf148, SRMS, or Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Srms. This enzyme belongs to the species Homo sapiens and falls under the category of single proteins. Its preferred name is Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Srms, and it is classified as an enzyme, kinase, or protein kinase belonging to the tyrosine protein kinase Src family.
