This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It has been modified to convert the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset includes various features, including Institution, Sex, Treatment, Grade, Age, Condition, Site, and Entry Status, which have been categorized into Positive and Negative classes based on the computed mean.
