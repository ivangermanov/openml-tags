The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation, which includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is a complex mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the inputs and outputs. It includes five features for input, and additional features are added to the datasets to measure the effects of nonrelated features. 

To generate the datasets, five different colinearity degrees were used, which is the number of features depending on other features. This was done to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters include the number of features, which range from five to one hundred, where only the first five features are related to the output, and the rest are completely random. The number of samples ranges from one hundred to one thousand.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets were generated by varying the feature number, sample number, and colinearity degree. The last attribute in each file is the target.
