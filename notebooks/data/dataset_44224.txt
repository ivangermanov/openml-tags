Membership Woes

A certain premium club, boasting a large customer membership, requires its members to pay an annual membership fee in exchange for the privilege of using its exclusive facilities. The fees are customized for every member's personal package, taking into account their individual needs and preferences. However, over the past few years, the club has been facing a significant issue with a substantial number of members cancelling their memberships, which has raised concerns among the management.

To address this issue, the club management plans to take a proactive approach by identifying and addressing customer grievances. However, they do not have the necessary resources to reach out to the entire customer base individually, and are therefore looking to explore whether a statistical approach can help them identify customers who are at risk of cancelling their memberships.

The aim is to help the club identify these customers, so that they can take targeted measures to retain them and prevent further cancellations. To achieve this, the club has collected a range of data on its members, including their membership details, personal information, and payment history.

Features: Membership Number, Membership Term in Years, Annual Fees, Marital Status, Gender, Annual Income, Occupation Code, Membership Package, Age at Issue, Additional Members, Payment Mode, Agent Code, Membership Status, Start Date, and End Date.
