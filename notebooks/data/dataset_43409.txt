Historical Weather Data of Goa, India

Tags: Context

I am currently building a short-term electric load forecasting model for Goa, which is a significant task. A substantial portion of the load is comprised of domestic household consumption. Temperature and humidity are crucial factors that can be used to estimate the heat index, which can be employed as one of the input variables for the model. Therefore, future temperature and humidity predictions are essential for the model's accuracy.

The dataset contains historical weather data from July 1, 2016, to July 31, 2019, with a 15-minute resolution. The data includes temperature at 2 meters above ground, relative humidity at 2 meters above ground, pressure at ground level, wind speed at 10 meters above ground, wind direction at 10 meters above ground, rainfall mass density per square meter area, and surface incoming shortwave irradiation.

The data was downloaded from the website http://www.soda-pro.com/web-services/meteo-data/merra, which is provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) / Goddard Space Flight Center. More information about the dataset can be found at http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2. The licenses for the data can be accessed at http://www.soda-pro.com/documents/10157/326300/CAMS-data-license.pdf and http://www.soda-pro.com/documents/10157/326300/SoDa-license.pdf.

The inspiration behind this dataset is to use the available past data to make future predictions of humidity and temperature.
