QSAR-TID-20025 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20025. The dataset has eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase RIPK2, which is a protein target involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and immune response. The protein is a key player in the regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathways and is involved in the activation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity.

The dataset provides a detailed description of the protein, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also includes information about the protein's expression, function, and process, as well as its relationships with other proteins and molecules.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase RIPK2 and its role in various cellular processes.
