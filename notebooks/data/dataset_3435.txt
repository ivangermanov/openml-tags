This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the C-X-C chemokine receptor type five, which is a single protein and has preferred name. It also has synonyms, including BLR one, Burkitt lymphoma receptor one, CD one eighty-five, and others.

The C-X-C chemokine receptor type five belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and chemokine receptor.

It is involved in various biological processes, including chemotaxis, immune response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, and others.

The receptor has various functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, protein binding, C-C chemokine receptor activity, C-X-C chemokine receptor activity, and C-C chemokine binding.

Keywords: QSAR, C-X-C chemokine receptor, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, chemotaxis, immune response.
