Australian Seed One Dataset with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the Australian dataset, generated with a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed ten. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, retaining only the instances that belonged to these classes.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled, reducing the number of columns to one hundred. The column selection was done randomly, but the resulting columns were sorted in ascending order to maintain consistency.

Finally, the dataset was further reduced by randomly selecting two thousand instances, while maintaining the stratification of the classes. This was achieved by using a train-test split function, which ensured that the class distribution was preserved in the subsampled dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features, which are A One, A Two, A Three, A Four, A Five, A Six, A Seven, A Eight, A Nine, A Ten, A Eleven, A Twelve, A Thirteen, A Fourteen, and A Fifteen.
