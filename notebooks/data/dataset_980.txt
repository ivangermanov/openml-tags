Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous input features, ranging from input to input, which represent various aspects of the optical digit recognition task. The final feature is the binary class, which indicates the classification outcome.

This dataset is a modified version of an optical digit recognition dataset, where the original multi-class problem has been transformed into a binary classification task. The majority class has been designated as positive, while all other classes have been grouped together as negative. This binarization process allows for simpler analysis and potentially different insights into the digit recognition problem. The dataset is likely used for machine learning and pattern recognition studies, particularly in the field of computer vision and handwritten digit classification.
