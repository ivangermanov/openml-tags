GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating diverse quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among others, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from an increasing necessity within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems that could be leveraged by various researchers. This enables the comparison of numerous classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample within the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly accessible Expression Project for Oncology repository managed by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of the Expression Project for Oncology and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is subsequently updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain sans intellectual property restrictions. This accessibility translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Although multiple sources of gene expression data are available, the decision to utilize data from the Expression Project for Oncology repository was made due to the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the use of the same microarray platform for all samples, the availability of supplementary information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the availability of a substantial number of samples for diverse tumor types.

When publishing material based on GEMLeR datasets, kindly acknowledge the assistance received by utilizing this repository. This facilitates replication of experiments and enables others to access the same datasets.
