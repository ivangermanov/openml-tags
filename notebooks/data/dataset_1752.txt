The QSAR-TID-101032 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101032. This dataset has eighty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset includes features such as molecule chembl id, and many others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and should be cited accordingly.

The target protein for this dataset is Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase Eleven, also known as Liver Kinase B One, which is a single protein. It belongs to the species group Homo Sapiens and has been classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase belonging to the CAMK protein kinase group, specifically the CAMK protein kinase LKB subfamily.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of cell growth, tissue homeostasis, vasculature development, protein phosphorylation, and many others. It has been found to be involved in various cellular components, including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and others.
