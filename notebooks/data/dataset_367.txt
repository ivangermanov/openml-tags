**Balloon**

The data consists of observations taken from a balloon approximately thirty kilometers above the surface of the Earth. In the section of the flight shown here, the balloon increases in height. As radiation naturally increases with height, there is a non-decreasing trend present in the data. The outliers are caused by the fact that the balloon slowly rotates, which causes the ropes from which the measuring instrument is suspended to intermittently cut off the direct radiation from the Sun.

The first column contains the raw data, while the second column contains the residuals after the removal of a non-decreasing trend.
