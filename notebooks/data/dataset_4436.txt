Machine Learning and Mathematics Subsampling of the dataset KDD Cup Nine Up Selling with Seed One 

This dataset is generated using a specific algorithm that involves uniformly sampling classes and columns, followed by stratified sampling of rows. The goal is to create a smaller, more manageable dataset while preserving the overall characteristics of the original dataset.

The process begins by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If there are more than ten classes, a selection of ten classes is made based on their frequency distribution. The indices where these classes are present are then selected, and the corresponding data points are retained.

Next, the algorithm uniformly samples columns from the selected data points. If there are more than one hundred columns, a selection of one hundred columns is made randomly. The selected columns are then retained, and the remaining columns are discarded.

Finally, the algorithm performs stratified sampling of rows based on the class distribution. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a balanced representation of all classes.

The resulting dataset consists of the selected features, including Var Six, Thirteen, Twenty-One, and so on, along with the Up Selling target variable.
