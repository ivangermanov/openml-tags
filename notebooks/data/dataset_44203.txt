Intersectional Bias Assessment Testing Data

This synthetic dataset contains demographic and clinical information used to evaluate the performance of a trained classifier in predicting a mental health diagnosis, specifically identifying individuals with schizophrenia or depression, while also assessing the model's performance for intersectional bias.

The dataset is utilized in a tutorial focused on an intersectional approach to model construction and evaluation in mental health care.

Features included in this dataset are:

Diagnosis, Gender, Ethnicity, Living Situation, Delay, Feeling of Pleasure, Depressive Mood, Sleep Patterns, Fatigue, Appetite Changes, Ruminative Thinking, Concentration Ability, Psychomotor Activity, Delusional Thoughts, Suspicious Behavior, Social Withdrawal, Passive Behavior, Feeling of Tension, and Unusual Thought Patterns.

Keywords: Intersectional Bias, Mental Health Diagnosis, Classifier Performance, Demographic Data, Clinical Information.
