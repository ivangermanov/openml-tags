Intersectional Bias Assessment Testing Data

This synthetic dataset contains demographic and clinical data used to test the performance of a trained classifier in predicting a diagnosis, specifically of schizophrenia or depression, and assess performance for intersectional bias. This dataset is used in the tutorial An Intersectional Approach to Model Construction and Evaluation in Mental Health Care, which focuses on the importance of considering intersectional bias in machine learning models used in mental health care. The dataset features a range of demographic and clinical variables, including diagnosis, sex, race, housing status, delay in seeking treatment, and various symptoms such as anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbances, fatigue, appetite changes, rumination, concentration difficulties, psychomotor symptoms, delusions, suspiciousness, withdrawal, passive behavior, tension, and unusual thoughts.
