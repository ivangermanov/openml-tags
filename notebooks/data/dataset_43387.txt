Oranges versus Grapefruit

The task of distinguishing between oranges and grapefruits is relatively straightforward for humans, yet even with careful observation, some degree of error is inevitable. To simulate this challenge, this dataset generates a large collection of values based on the average characteristics of oranges and grapefruits, including their color, weight, and diameter.

Content
This dataset is primarily fictional, as collecting real-world data would require measuring actual fruits and generating artificial samples from those measurements. However, using hypothetical data seems sufficient for our purposes.

Inspiration
Binary classification scenarios abound, but they can be difficult to teach effectively. I required a dataset that would facilitate a clear-cut binary classification exercise while remaining engaging and thought-provoking.

Features include the fruit's name, diameter, weight, and color properties.
