This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex cad/jpy currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans a specific date range and excludes weekends, as Forex markets are not active during these periods.

The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone. The class attribute determines the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent minute relative to the current minute. Specifically, if the mean high price increases in the next minute, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it is false.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used to inform actual trading decisions. Realistic trade strategies should be based on predictions made using close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
