QSAR-TID-10766 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3, Text & Literature

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10766. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature, MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cytochrome P four fifty nineteen A one, also known as Aromatase. It belongs to the enzyme cytochrome P four fifty family nineteen subfamily A and is involved in various biological processes, including estrogen biosynthetic process, luteinization, and response to xenobiotic stimulus.

Cytochrome P four fifty nineteen A one is a protein target that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolic process, steroid hormone biosynthetic process, and cellular response to estradiol. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the metabolism of bile acids, steroids, and other lipids.

The protein has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and its inhibition has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of certain types of cancer.
