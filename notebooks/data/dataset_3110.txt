QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Cytochrome P Aromatase, also known as Arom, Cyp, and CYPXIX. This enzyme is found in Rattus norvegicus and belongs to the Cytochrome P family A subfamily. It is classified as an Enzyme within the Protein Target Classification system.

Cytochrome P is involved in numerous biological processes, including estrogen biosynthesis, androgen metabolism, gonad development, and response to various stimuli such as xenobiotics, metal ions, and hormones. The enzyme plays crucial roles in luteinization, bone development, mammary gland development, and prostate gland growth.

The protein is associated with several cellular components, including the endoplasmic reticulum, synaptic vesicles, neuronal cell bodies, and dendritic spines. Its molecular functions encompass monooxygenase activity, iron ion binding, oxidoreductase activity, and aromatase activity.

Cytochrome P is implicated in multiple signaling pathways and metabolic processes, such as estrogen biosynthesis, endogenous sterol metabolism, and calcineurin mediated signaling. The enzyme's activity is regulated by various factors, including fibroblast growth factor, follicle stimulating hormone, and hydrostatic pressure.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying the structure activity relationships of compounds interacting with Cytochrome P, which could aid in drug discovery efforts targeting this important enzyme.
