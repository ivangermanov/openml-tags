**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Foreign Exchange aud/jpy pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, represented by a single row, corresponds to one candlestick of one hour. The entire dataset spans a period from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Foreign Exchange market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute represents the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask prices of the subsequent hour, relative to the mean of the High Bid and High Ask prices of the current hour. In other words, the class attribute indicates whether the mean High price will increase or decrease (or remain unchanged) during the following hour.

**Note**: This dataset is intended for scientific purposes only, and realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of the Close attributes (also available).
