The Weather Problem dataset is a small, illustrative collection of data that will be used repeatedly throughout our exploration of machine learning methods. This entirely fictional dataset revolves around the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified outdoor game.

In general, instances within a dataset are characterized by the values of various features or attributes, which measure distinct aspects of each instance. In the context of the Weather Problem, there are four key attributes: the overall outlook, the ambient temperature, the relative humidity, and whether it is windy or not. The ultimate outcome or response variable is simply whether to play the game or not, given these environmental conditions.
