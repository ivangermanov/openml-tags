The Medical Charges dataset is a part of the regression on numerical features benchmark and has been transformed accordingly. This dataset is based on the Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use File, which provides comprehensive information on inpatient discharges for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.

The Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use File offers insights into utilization, payment, including total payment and Medicare payment, and hospital-specific charges for over three thousand US hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System payments. The file is organized by hospital and Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group, covering multiple fiscal years.

Features of this dataset include total discharges, average covered charges, average Medicare payments, and average total payments.
