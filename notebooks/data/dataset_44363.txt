Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It does this by first uniformly sampling classes from the dataset, then uniformly sampling columns, and finally uniformly sampling rows. The function uses random number generation to ensure that the sampling is random and reproducible.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes to sample, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. If the number of classes in the dataset is greater than the maximum number of classes, the function selects a random subset of classes to include in the subsample. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the dataset.

If the number of columns in the dataset is greater than the maximum number of columns, the function selects a random subset of columns to include in the subsample. It then uses these columns to subset the dataset.

Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset is greater than the maximum number of rows, the function uses stratified sampling to select a random subset of rows to include in the subsample. This ensures that the subsample has the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The function returns a new dataset that includes the subsampled data, as well as the categorical mask and column names.
