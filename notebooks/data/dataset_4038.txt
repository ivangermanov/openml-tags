QSAR-TID-17024 Dataset: Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 17024. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and a class feature.

The features represent Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

This dataset contains information about a single protein preferred named ADAM seventeen, also known as Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain Containing Protein seventeen. It is an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, and belongs to the MAM clan and Metallo Protease M twelve B subfamily.

ADAM seventeen is classified under the organism species group Sus Scrofa. It has relationships with accession number O seven seven six three six. 

ADAM seventeen is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis, Notch signaling pathway, Notch receptor processing, tumor necrosis factor mediated signaling pathway, and positive regulation of ERK one and ERK two cascade.

It has molecular functions, including endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, Notch binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.

It is located in the plasma membrane and membrane components.
