QSAR-TID-17024 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17024. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17024. The features of the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way to represent molecules as a set of numerical descriptors. These descriptors can be used to predict the activity of molecules on a specific target.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its name, synonyms, and classification. The target is a single protein, specifically ADAM17, which is a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, Notch signaling pathway, and tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway.
