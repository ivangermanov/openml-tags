Indian Startup Funding

Tags: Context, Interested in the Indian startup ecosystem

I am interested in the Indian startup ecosystem and wanted to know what type of startups are getting funded in the last few years. I also wanted to know who are the important investors and the hot fields that get a lot of funding these days. This dataset is a chance to explore the Indian startup scene, deep dive into funding data, and derive insights into the future.

This dataset has funding information of Indian startups from January 2015 to August 2017. It includes columns with the date funded, the city the startup is based out of, the names of the funders, and the amount invested in US dollars.

Possible questions that could be answered are: How does the funding ecosystem change with time? Do cities play a major role in funding? Which industries are favored by investors for funding? Who are the important investors in the Indian ecosystem? How much funding do startups generally get in India?
