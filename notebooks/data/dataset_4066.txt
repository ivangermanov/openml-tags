Wine Quality 

This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. 

The dataset consists of two sets of wine samples, one for red wine and another for white wine. The inputs include objective tests, such as pH values, and the output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert grades the wine quality between zero (very bad) and ten (very excellent).

Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed, including Mean Absolute Deviation and a confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance.

The datasets are related to the red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physiochemical and sensory variables are available, with no data about grape types, wine brands, or wine selling prices. 

These datasets can be viewed as either classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. It would also be interesting to test feature selection methods, as not all input variables might be relevant.

The datasets have eleven input variables, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcohol. The output variable is the quality of the wine, scored between zero and ten.

Several of the attributes may be correlated, so applying feature selection methods might be useful.
