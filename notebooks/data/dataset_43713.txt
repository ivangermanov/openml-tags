Tags: Context

This dataset is part of a larger project that I have been working on, which aims to analyze and compare real historical weather data with weather folklore. The dataset provides a comprehensive hourly and daily summary of weather conditions in the Szeged, Hungary area, covering a period of ten years.

The dataset includes a wide range of weather-related data, including time, summary, precipitation type, temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind bearing, visibility, cloud cover, and pressure. This data is available at an hourly and daily level, providing a detailed picture of weather patterns in the region.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the Dark Sky team for providing access to their API, which made it possible to collect and analyze this data.

The dataset features a range of variables, including formatted date, summary, precipitation type, temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind bearing, visibility, cloud cover, and pressure.
