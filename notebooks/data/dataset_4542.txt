Subsampling of the dataset Ada with seed equal to two arguments number rows max equal to two thousand arguments number cols max equal to one hundred arguments number classes max equal to ten arguments no stratify equal to true generated with the following source code.

This function subsamples a given dataset. It takes several parameters including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, and the maximum number of classes. The function first uniformly samples the classes, ensuring that all classes are represented in the resulting dataset. Then, it uniformly samples the columns if required. Finally, it stratifies the sampling of rows according to the target variable.

Features: variables one through forty-eight, class
