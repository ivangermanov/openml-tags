QSAR-TID-51 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 51. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Serotonin 1a receptor, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including behavioral fear response, signal transduction, and neurotransmitter receptor activity.

The Serotonin 1a receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating serotonin levels in the brain. It is involved in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery for the Serotonin 1a receptor.
