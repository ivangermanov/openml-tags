QSAR-TID-10300 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10300. The dataset has twenty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta. This receptor is a single protein, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily One Group B Member Two, Rarb, or RAR-beta. It is a transcription factor and a nuclear hormone receptor, and it plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including transcription, cell differentiation, and apoptosis.

The receptor is involved in several biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription, ureteric bud development, glandular epithelial cell development, and growth plate cartilage development. It is also involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, apoptotic process, cell population proliferation, and hormone-mediated signaling pathway.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening. The dataset is available for download and can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and drug discovery.
