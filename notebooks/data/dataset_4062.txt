Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way, belonging to the "Regression on Numerical Features" benchmark.

The Computer Activity database is a collection of computer systems activity measures. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation with 128 megabytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files, or running very CPU-bound programs. The data was collected continuously on two separate occasions. On both occasions, system activity was gathered every five seconds. The final dataset is taken from both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming from each collection epoch.

System measures used include various aspects of memory and processing activity, such as reads and writes between system memory and user memory, system calls, and page faults.

The dataset has two different regression tasks obtained from these databases. The first task is to predict the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode from all attributes. The second task is to predict the same attribute using a restricted number of attributes, excluding the paging information.

This dataset has characteristics including 8192 cases and twenty-two continuous attributes.

Features include various aspects of system activity, such as memory access patterns and processor usage.

Keywords: computer activity, CPU usage, memory access, system calls, page faults, regression analysis.
