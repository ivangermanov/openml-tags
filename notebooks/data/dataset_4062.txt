QSAR-TID-10844 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CSK, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CSK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.

The target protein is Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CSK, also known as CSK, C-Src Kinase, Protein-Tyrosine Kinase CYL, and Tyrosine-Protein Kinase CSK. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and tyrosine protein kinase Csk family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including adaptive immune response, immune system process, protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, and phosphorylation. It is also involved in various cellular components, including cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, cell-cell junction, and membrane.
