The similarities and differences in the behaviors of different people have long been of interest, particularly in the fields of psychology and other social sciences. Understanding human behavior in particular contexts can help us to make informed decisions. Consider a game of poker, for instance - understanding why players raise, call, and fold in various situations can provide a distinct advantage competitively. Along these lines, we are going to focus on the behavior of online gamblers from a platform called Bustabit.

There are a few basic rules for playing a game of Bustabit: you bet a certain amount of money, and you win if you cash out before the game busts. Your win is calculated by the multiplier value at the moment you cashed out. For example, if you bet a certain amount and the value was a certain multiplier at the time you cashed out, you win a certain amount. In addition, a percentage bonus per game is multiplied with your bet and summed to give your final profit in a winning game. Assuming a bonus, your profit for this round would be the product of your bet and the multiplier, plus the product of your bet and the bonus, minus your initial bet.

The multiplier increases as time goes on, but if you wait too long to cash out, you may bust and lose your money. Lastly, the house maintains a slight advantage because in a certain percentage of games, everyone playing busts.
