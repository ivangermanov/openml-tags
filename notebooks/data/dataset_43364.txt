The Similarities and Differences in Behaviors of Different People Have Long Been of Interest

Understanding human behavior in particular contexts can help us make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge. A prime example of this is in the game of poker, where grasping why players raise, call, and fold in various situations provides a distinct advantage.

Along these lines, we are focusing on the behavior of online gamblers from a platform called Bustabit. To play a game of Bustabit, one bets a certain amount of money, known as Bits, and wins if they cash out before the game busts. The win is calculated by the multiplier value at the moment of cashing out. For instance, if one bets a certain amount and the value was a specific multiplier at the time of cashing out, they win that amount. Additionally, a percentage bonus per game is multiplied with the bet and summed to give the final profit in a winning game. 

Assuming a bonus, one's profit for this round would be the product of their bet and the multiplier plus the product of their bet and the bonus minus their initial bet. However, the multiplier increases over time, and waiting too long to cash out risks losing one's money. Moreover, the house maintains a slight advantage due to the fact that in a certain number of games, everyone playing busts.
