QSAR-TID-251 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet Activating Factor Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP6 Molecular Fingerprints

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet Activating Factor Receptor. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Platelet Activating Factor Receptor is a single protein that is a membrane receptor and is classified as a Family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is a small molecule receptor that is involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, signal transduction, and inflammatory response.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes including chemotaxis, immune response, and response to lipopolysaccharide. It is also involved in the regulation of cellular extravasation, phospholipase C activity, and interleukin-six production.

The receptor is a target for various compounds including Rupatadine and Minopafant, which are platelet activating factor receptor antagonists.
