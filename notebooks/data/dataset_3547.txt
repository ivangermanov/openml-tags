**QSAR-TID-251**

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 251. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, with activity values measured in pseudo-pCI50 units. The features were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA, and do not require missing value imputation.
