QSAR-TID-101506 Dataset: 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Single Protein, also known as Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase TAO Three, which is an enzyme belonging to the STE protein kinase group and STE protein kinase TAO subfamily. 

The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule Chembl IDs and class feature median pxc fifty. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Systemes Biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule Chembl ID and various FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
