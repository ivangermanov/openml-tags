**Data Description**

This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex EUR/RUB currency pair obtained from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a single hourly candlestick, devoid of weekend data since Forex markets remain closed during this period. The timestamp feature adheres to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the directional movement of the mean high price over the subsequent hourly interval relative to the current hourly mean high price. Specifically, the class attribute assumes a value of true if the mean high price ascends during the forthcoming hourly interval, and false if it declines or remains stagnant.

Please note that this dataset serves a purely scientific purpose, and realistic trading strategies should exclusively rely on predictions based on close attributes, also available within this dataset.
