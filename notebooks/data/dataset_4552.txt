Data Set Information:
Pitch classes information has been extracted from MIDI sources downloaded from the JSB Chorales website. Meter information has been computed through the Meter program, which is part of the Melisma music analyzer. Chord labels have been manually annotated by a human expert.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes the chorale ID, corresponding to the file names from Bach Central, and the event number, which is the index of the event inside the chorale. The pitch classes are represented as yes or no, depending on whether a given pitch is present. The pitch classes are assigned to attributes as follows: C, C sharp or D flat, D, and so on, up to B. The bass note is represented by its pitch class, and the meter is represented by an integer from one to five, with lower numbers denoting less accented events and higher numbers denoting more accented events. The chord label represents the chord resonating during the given event.

Relevant Papers:
The dataset is related to research on music information retrieval, particularly on chord recognition systems.
