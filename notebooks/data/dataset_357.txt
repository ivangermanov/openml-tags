This dataset is known as the SensIT Vehicle (combined) dataset, retrieved from the libSVM site. In addition to the preprocessing performed there, this dataset was created by joining test and train datasets that were already pre-combined. The classes were relabeled, with classes one and two becoming the positive class and class three becoming the negative class. Each file was normalized columnwise according to specific rules:

If a column contained only one value (constant feature), it was set to zero and subsequently removed due to sparsity. For columns with two values (binary features), the more frequently occurring value was set to zero, while the other was set to one. Columns with more than two values (multinary or real features) were divided by their standard deviation.

The dataset is used for vehicle classification in distributed sensor networks. It combines multiple sensor readings to identify and categorize different types of vehicles. This approach leverages the power of distributed computing and sensor networks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of vehicle detection and classification.

The features in this dataset represent various sensor readings and derived metrics, providing a comprehensive set of data points for analysis and classification tasks. These features capture different aspects of vehicle characteristics, including acoustic and seismic signatures, which can be used to distinguish between different types of vehicles.

This dataset is particularly useful for studying concept drift in machine learning, as vehicle characteristics and sensor readings may change over time or in different environments. It also serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on sensor network applications, distributed computing, and pattern recognition in the context of vehicle identification.
