**The Meta Album Insect Dataset Extended**

The original Insect dataset was created by the National Museum of Natural History, Paris. It consists of over 290,000 images in various sizes and orientations. The dataset has a hierarchical classification system, ranging from order, super family, family, and taxa. Each image depicts an insect in its natural environment or habitat, often on a flower or near vegetation.

The images were collected by researchers and numerous volunteers from the SPIPOLL Science project. They were uploaded to a central server via the SPIPOLL website, Android application, or iOS application. The preprocessed insect dataset was prepared from the original dataset by carefully processing the images. This involved cropping the images from both sides to create square images, which were then resized to 128x128 pixels using Open-CV with an anti-aliasing filter.
