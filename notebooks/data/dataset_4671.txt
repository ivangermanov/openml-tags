Subsampling of the dataset Fashion MNIST with Seed One 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of forty thousand nine hundred ninety six samples. The subsampling was performed using a specific set of parameters, including a seed value of one, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. Additionally, the stratified sampling approach was employed.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the dataset were identified, and then a random selection of ten classes was made. This was done to ensure that the subsampled dataset would retain a representative distribution of classes. Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Finally, the stratified sampling approach was used to select a subset of two thousand samples from the remaining dataset.

The resulting subsampled dataset consists of a subset of the original features, specifically those corresponding to pixels fifteen, twenty, twenty five, thirty one, forty three, forty six, forty eight, sixty one, sixty eight, eighty six, eighty seven, eighty nine, ninety seven, one hundred, one sixteen, one twenty, one forty seven, one sixty six, one seventy three, one eighty, one ninety, one ninety one, two zero one, two zero five, two seventeen, two nineteen, two thirty five, two forty, two sixty seven, two seventy four, two seventy six, two eighty one, two eighty seven, two ninety one, two ninety five, three fourteen, three nineteen, three twenty two, three twenty four, three twenty five, three forty three, three fifty, three fifty one, three fifty two, three fifty five, three sixty four, three eighty two, three eighty five, three eighty six, three ninety six, three ninety eight, four zero zero, four zero two, four twenty seven, four fifty one, four fifty two, four fifty seven, four sixty three, four sixty eight, four ninety two, five nineteen, five twenty four, five thirty two, five thirty four, five thirty eight, five forty five, five forty six, five fifty, five sixty two, five sixty nine, five seventy eight, five eighty, five eighty four, five eighty five, five eighty eight, five ninety one, five ninety three, six zero four, six eleven, six twenty one, six forty three, six fifty one, six fifty two, six fifty four, six fifty five, six fifty seven, six sixty four, six eighty four, six ninety four, seven zero one, seven zero six, seven fourteen, seven fifteen, seven sixteen, seven eighteen, seven twenty two, seven twenty nine, seven thirty seven, seven forty, seven sixty five.
