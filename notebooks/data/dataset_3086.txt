This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Fer, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Fer.

The drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Fer is also known as Feline Encephalitis Virus-Related Kinase Fer, Fer, Fujinami Poultry Sarcoma/Feline Sarcoma-Related Protein Fer, and Proto-Oncogene c-Fer. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and TK protein kinase group, specifically a Tyrosine Protein Kinase Fer family.

The dataset features were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains multiple features including molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty. The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule in the dataset. The median PXc fifty is a measure of the activity of each compound.

The drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Fer is involved in multiple biological processes including microtubule cytoskeleton organization, regulation of protein phosphorylation, protein phosphorylation, chemotaxis, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein.
