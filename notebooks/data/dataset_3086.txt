QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Tyrosine protein kinase FER, also known as Feline encephalitis virus related kinase FER, FER Fujinami poultry sarcoma/Feline sarcoma related protein, Fer p Fer Proto oncogene c Fer. This single protein target is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Fer family classification.

The target protein is associated with various cellular components, including chromatin, nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, adherens junction, cell cortex, actin cytoskeleton, microtubule cytoskeleton, lamellipodium, and cell projections. Its molecular functions involve nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, ATP binding, and transferase activity.

The protein participates in numerous biological processes, such as microtubule cytoskeleton organization, regulation of protein phosphorylation, cell adhesion, signal transduction, germ cell development, regulation of cell population proliferation, male gonad development, regulation of lamellipodium assembly, cytokine mediated signaling pathway, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and cellular response to various stimuli including insulin, lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen species.

Additional information about this target can be found in various databases and resources, including ExpressionAtlas, Gene Ontology, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
