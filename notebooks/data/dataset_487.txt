This dataset is one of two multivariate regression datasets from the paper industry, obtained from an experiment at the paper plant Saugbruksforeningen in Norway. The dataset has been thoroughly described and analyzed in a research paper titled "Moderate Projection Pursuit Regression for Multivariate Response Data". 

It comprises thirty observations and forty-one variables. The first thirty-two columns represent response variables that describe various qualities of the paper. The remaining nine columns consist of predictor variables. 

The first three predictor variables were deliberately varied systematically throughout the experiment. The next three predictor variables were constructed as squares of the initial three variables. The last three predictor variables were constructed as products of pairs of the initial three variables.

Features: response one, response two, response three, ... , response thirty-two, variable one, variable two, variable three, variable one squared, variable two squared, variable three squared, variable one times variable two, variable two times variable three, variable three times variable two.

Keywords: Papir 2, multivariate regression, paper industry, predictor variables, response variables.
