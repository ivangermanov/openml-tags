The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from a specific source. 

These datasets' names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

Friedman is one of the most used functions for data generation. Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: the output is equal to ten times the sine of pi times the product of the first two inputs plus twenty times the square of the third input minus point five squared plus ten times the fourth input plus five times the fifth input plus the noise.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to the colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: the number of features varies; the number of samples varies; and the colinearity degrees vary.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
