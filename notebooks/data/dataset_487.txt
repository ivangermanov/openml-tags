This dataset is one of two multivariate regression datasets from the paper industry, originating from an experiment conducted at a paper plant in Norway. The data have been analyzed and described in a published paper in Computational Statistics and Data Analysis.

The dataset comprises observations and variables. The first set of variables are response variables that describe various qualities of the paper. The remaining variables are predictor variables. The initial three predictor variables were systematically varied throughout the experiment. The next three predictor variables are constructed as squared terms of the first three. The final three predictor variables are interaction terms between the first three predictors.

The dataset has been used to explore moderate projection pursuit regression for multivariate response data. It provides a rich source of information for studying the relationships between paper qualities and various input factors in the paper production process.

Researchers interested in multivariate regression analysis, particularly in industrial applications, may find this dataset valuable for developing and testing statistical models. The structured nature of the predictor variables, including main effects, quadratic terms, and interactions, allows for the exploration of complex relationships in paper quality outcomes.

This dataset serves as an excellent example of how designed experiments in industrial settings can generate data suitable for advanced statistical analysis, potentially leading to improvements in manufacturing processes and product quality.
