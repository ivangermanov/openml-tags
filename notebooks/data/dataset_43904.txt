Machine Learning, Meteorology Law School Admissions Binary Dataset 

This survey was conducted among students attending law school in the United States. The dataset was obtained from the R package Fair ML. 

The response variable has been altered to create a binary version, specifically whether an undergraduate grade point average is greater than three point zero. Additionally, the race one variable has been simplified into two distinct categories: White and Non-White.

This dataset includes several key factors, including Age, Decile Rankings, Family Income, Law School Admission Test Scores, Gender, Race, Cluster, Full-Time Enrollment Status, Bar Examination Results, and Undergraduate Grade Point Averages Greater Than Three.
