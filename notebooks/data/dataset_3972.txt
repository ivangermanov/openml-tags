This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Dopamine D3 Receptor, and it has numerous rows and features. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The Dopamine D3 Receptor is a single protein, also known as D(3) dopamine receptor or Dopamine Receptor D3, belonging to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and specifically classified as a monoamine receptor.

QSAR-TID-130 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September 2015.

This dataset contains numerous molecular compounds with their corresponding activity values, which can be used for machine learning model development, particularly in the area of multi-task learning QSAR.

The molecular fingerprints were generated using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working on developing predictive models for Dopamine D3 Receptor, and it can be used for various applications such as virtual screening, lead optimization, and toxicity prediction.
