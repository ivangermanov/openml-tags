QSAR-TID-130 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 130. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 3133 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The Dopamine D3 receptor is a single protein and is also known as D(3) dopamine receptor. It is a membrane receptor and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is a small molecule receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity, and signal transduction.

The receptor is targeted by various compounds, including Trazpiroben, which is a dopamine D3 receptor antagonist, and Sarizotan, which is a dopamine D3 receptor agonist. Other compounds that target the receptor include Etilevodopa and Levodopa, which are dopamine D3 receptor agonists.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic transmission, dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity, and signal transduction. It is also involved in various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.
