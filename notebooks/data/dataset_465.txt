The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number".

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation, including both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function includes five features for input and is defined as y equals ten times sine of pi times x1 times x2 plus twenty times x3 minus point five squared equals ten times X4 plus five times X5 plus e.

To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: The number of features varies, including only the first five features being related to the output, while the rest are completely random. The number of samples also varies. Additionally, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target.
