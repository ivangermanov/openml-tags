The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset is a highly unbalanced classification problem, where the goal is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This is a crucial task for credit card companies to prevent customers from being charged for items they did not purchase.

The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with a total of 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. The positive class, which represents fraudulent transactions, accounts for only 0.172% of all transactions.

The dataset consists of numerical input variables, which are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and background information about the data cannot be provided.

The dataset includes the following features: Time, which represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, and Amount, which is the transaction amount. The feature Class is the response variable, taking a value of one in case of fraud and zero otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, it is recommended to measure the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), as the confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

The dataset has been collected and analyzed during a research collaboration on big data mining and fraud detection.
