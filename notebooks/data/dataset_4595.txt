Machine Learning Dataset: MFeat Factors

This dataset is a subsampled version of the MFeat Factors dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns from the original dataset.

The dataset has undergone several transformations, including class selection, column selection, and row selection. The class selection process involved choosing a specified number of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that each selected class had an equal probability of being chosen. This was done to maintain the stratification of the dataset.

The column selection process involved randomly choosing a specified number of columns from the original dataset. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its underlying structure.

Finally, the row selection process involved sampling a specified number of rows from the dataset, ensuring that the resulting dataset was stratified according to the chosen classes.

The resulting dataset consists of a specified number of rows, columns, and classes, making it suitable for machine learning tasks.

Features:

The dataset includes a range of features, including attributes related to various factors. These features are essential for modeling and analysis purposes.
