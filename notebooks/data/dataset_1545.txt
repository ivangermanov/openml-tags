This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: seventeen thousand one hundred forty-five, and it has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule chembl id and median px c fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systemes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and many others.

This dataset is part of the metaqsar project and was created in september two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains qsar data from chembl version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target tid seventeen thousand one hundred forty-five.
