The QSAR-TID-101602 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101602. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite this dataset when used.

This dataset contains information about a single protein, specifically the serine threonine protein kinase LATS two. It is also known as kinase phosphorylated during mitosis protein KPM and large tumor suppressor homolog two.

The organism associated with this protein is Homo sapiens. The protein target classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase AGC protein kinase group AGC protein kinase NDR family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including G one S transition of mitotic cell cycle, inner cell mass cell fate commitment, inner cell mass cellular morphogenesis, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, protein localization, hormone mediated signaling pathway, phosphorylation, regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway, peptidyl serine phosphorylation, keratinocyte differentiation, hippo signaling, intracellular signal transduction, positive regulation of apoptotic process, negative regulation of cyclin dependent protein serine threonine kinase activity, regulation of organ growth, cell division, canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, serine threonine protein kinase, protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, hippo signaling, Wnt signaling pathway.
