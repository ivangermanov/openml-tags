This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one twenty sixty seven, and it has numerous rows and many features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, and many more.

Scraped data includes information about caspase seven, an enzyme that belongs to the protein family of cysteine proteases.

Caspase seven is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including apoptosis, which is a form of programmed cell death.

It is also involved in the inflammatory response, heart development, and metabolic processes.

Additionally, caspase seven is known to participate in the defense response to bacteria and the positive regulation of apoptotic processes.

Furthermore, it is involved in the fibroblast apoptotic process, neuron apoptotic process, and lymphocyte apoptotic process.

Caspase seven has been shown to interact with various other proteins, including xiap, which is an inhibitor of apoptosis.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, caspase seven, apoptosis, cysteine proteases, inflammatory response, heart development, metabolic processes.
