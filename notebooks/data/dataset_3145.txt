QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Caspase, also known as Apoptotic protease Mch, CASP, and Caspase subunit p. This single protein target is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the enzyme/protease/cysteine protease classification. Caspase is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, apoptosis, inflammatory response, heart development, and protein processing. It is associated with multiple cellular components such as the extracellular region, nucleus, cytoplasm, and caspase complex.

Caspase functions include RNA binding, catalytic activity, endopeptidase activity, and protein binding. It plays crucial roles in apoptotic processes, defense responses, and cellular responses to various stimuli. The protein is referenced in several databases, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe, with numerous associated entries and structures.

The dataset provides valuable information for quantitative structure activity relationship studies, particularly in the context of drug discovery and development targeting Caspase and related proteins.
