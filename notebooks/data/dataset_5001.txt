**Andes Bayesian Network. Sample Five**

This dataset is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository and is categorized under Health and Medicine.

The Andes Bayesian network consists of two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs, with one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, and the average degree is roughly three point zero three. The maximum in-degree is six.

This network is particularly useful for online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It has been employed in various educational settings to facilitate adaptive learning and personalized instruction.

Some notable features of this network include goal-oriented nodes, resolve nodes, choose nodes, identify nodes, and many others that are specific to the domain of physics and mathematics.
