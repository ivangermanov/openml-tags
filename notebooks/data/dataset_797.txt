This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification results in a clear distinction between the two classes.

The dataset consists of various features that describe different aspects of the chemical compounds under study. These features include characteristics related to the chemical structure and properties of the compounds.
