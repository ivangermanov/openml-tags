Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains fifty features labeled as oz followed by a number. The final feature is labeled binaryClass.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification task. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean, respectively.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies and appears to be part of a larger research effort involving mythbusting and various analytical approaches. While the original source and date of creation are unknown, it is clear that this version is derived from an earlier dataset and has been specifically processed for binary classification purposes.

Researchers using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The binary classification approach may be particularly useful for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that require categorical outcomes.
