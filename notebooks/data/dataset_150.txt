The task consists of learning quantitative structure activity relationships, specifically the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by pyrimidines.

The data describes the characteristics of seventy-four cases, each with twenty-eight continuous variables. These variables include features related to molecular properties, such as polarity, size, flexibility, hydrogen bonding, and pi-donor and pi-acceptor abilities.

This dataset, known as Pyrim, is a collection of regression datasets focused on chemistry and machine learning. It was sourced from an original study on drug design using machine learning to model the structure-activity relationships of trimethoprim analogues binding to dihydrofolate reductase.

Keywords: QSAR, machine learning, chemistry, dihydrofolate reductase, pyrimidines, quantitative structure activity relationships, molecular properties.
