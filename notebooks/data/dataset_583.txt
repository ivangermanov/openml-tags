Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate collinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

Friedman is one of the most commonly used functions for data generation. Friedman functions incorporate both linear and non-linear relations between input and output, with normalized noise added to the output. The Friedman function is expressed as a mathematical equation involving trigonometric and polynomial terms.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. However, to assess the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with different collinearity degrees. The collinearity degree represents the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in the number of features, number of samples, and collinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. The datasets with higher collinearity degrees have more features generated.

As a result, numerous artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and collinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Features: The dataset includes multiple features labeled as "oz" followed by a number. These features represent various input variables used in the Friedman function and additional random variables.
