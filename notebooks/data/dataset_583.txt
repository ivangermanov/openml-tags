The Friedman datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

These dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation, which includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: the output is equal to ten times the sine of pi times the product of the first two inputs plus twenty times the square of the third input minus point five squared plus ten times the fourth input plus five times the fifth input plus the noise.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 

These added features are independent from the output; however, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. 

Collinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: the number of features varies, where only the first five features are related to the output, and the rest are completely random; the number of samples also varies; and the collinearity degrees vary.

For the datasets with collinearity degree four, the numbers of features are generated differently. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying the feature number, sample number, and collinearity degree.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
