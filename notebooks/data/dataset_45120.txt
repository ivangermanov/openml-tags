**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample 0.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a comprehensive resource for Bayesian network models. This particular model, the Barley Bayesian Network, is a preliminary model developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown without the Use of Pesticides".

The Barley Bayesian Network consists of forty-eight nodes and eighty-four arcs, with a total of parameters exceeding one hundred fourteen thousand. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point two five, and the average degree is three point five. The maximum in-degree is four.

This Bayesian network model is a complex representation of the relationships between various factors influencing the production of beer from Danish malting barley. The model takes into account a wide range of variables, including characteristics of the barley, environmental factors, and farming practices.
