**Barley Bayesian Network. Sample Zero.**

This dataset is a preliminary model for barley developed under the project "Production of Beer from Danish Malting Barley Grown Without the Use of Pesticides". The network consists of forty-eight nodes connected by eighty-four arcs, representing various factors influencing barley production.

The Barley Bayesian Network has a total of parameters, with an average Markov blanket size of approximately five point two five, indicating moderate complexity. The average degree of the nodes is three point five, with a maximum in-degree of four, suggesting a relatively sparse network structure.

This Bayesian network aims to model various aspects of barley production, including characteristics such as protein content, sorting, and size. It also incorporates environmental factors like nitrogen levels, soil type, and pesticide usage.

Features included in this model include characteristics related to barley quality, growth conditions, and farming practices.
