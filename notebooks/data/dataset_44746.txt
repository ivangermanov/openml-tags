Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in several parameters including self, seed, number rows max, number columns max, number classes max, and stratified. It uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility. It first selects the unique classes from the target variable y, and if there are more than the maximum allowed number of classes, it samples from them uniformly using their value counts as probabilities. It then selects the corresponding indices from the data and target variables. Next, it samples columns uniformly if their number exceeds the maximum allowed, sorts them, and selects the corresponding columns from the data. If the resulting data has more rows than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data while preserving the class distribution.
