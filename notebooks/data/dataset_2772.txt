**Data Description**
This is the historical price data of the Forex US Dollar/Japanese Yen currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one hour. The entire dataset spans a specific range of dates and does not include weekends, as the Forex market is not traded during this time.

The time zone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam. The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask prices of the following hour, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is expected to increase during the next hour, and false when the mean High price is expected to decrease or remain unchanged during the next hour.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trading strategies should only be applied to predictions based on Close attributes, which are also available.**
