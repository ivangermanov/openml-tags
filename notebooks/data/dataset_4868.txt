Nomao collects data about places including their name, phone number, and localization from multiple sources. The process of deduplication involves detecting which data refers to the same place. The instances in the dataset compare two spots. 

The dataset was enriched during the Nomao Challenge, an event organized alongside the Active Learning in Real-world Applications workshop, held at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases conference.

Features of the dataset include various variables related to the characteristics of the places.
