The QSAR-TID-12014 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12014. This dataset has twenty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains information about the Caspase-nine protein, also known as Apaf-three or Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor three. It is an enzyme that belongs to the Peptidase C fourteen family and plays a crucial role in the apoptotic process.

The Caspase-nine protein is involved in various biological processes, including response to hypoxia, kidney development, response to ischemia, proteolysis, and apoptotic process. It is also involved in the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to DNA damage and the activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process by cytochrome c.

This protein has been shown to interact with other proteins, including APAF-one, Cytochrome c, and XIAP. It is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and cytosol.

Keywords: QSAR, Caspase-nine, Apaf-three, Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor three, Peptidase C fourteen family, apoptotic process, intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, DNA damage.
