QSAR-TID-10300 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10300. It consists of twenty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty, among others.

The dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
