Win95pts Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete large network. 

The network has a total number of nodes and arcs that represent relationships between variables. The number of parameters indicates the complexity of the network. 

The average Markov blanket size and average degree provide insights into the structure of the network. The maximum in-degree suggests the most influential node in the network.
