QSAR-TID-11569 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11569. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 120 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015.

The Ephrin type-B receptor 2 is a single protein target, also known as Developmentally-regulated Eph-related tyrosine kinase, DRT, EK5, ELK-related tyrosine kinase, and EPHB2. It is a protein kinase that belongs to the tyrosine protein kinase Eph family.

The Ephrin type-B receptor 2 is involved in various biological processes, including cell morphogenesis, angiogenesis, urogenital system development, negative regulation of protein phosphorylation, and positive regulation of immunoglobulin production. It is also involved in protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of cell adhesion, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is involved in the development of the nervous system, particularly in the formation of axons and dendrites. It is also involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the formation of synapses.

The Ephrin type-B receptor 2 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and has been targeted by several drugs in clinical trials.
