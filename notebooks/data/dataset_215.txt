This is an artificial dataset described in a statistical reference book. It generates values for ten attributes independently using specific probabilities. The first attribute has equal probability of being negative one or positive one. The remaining attributes have equal probability of being negative one, zero, or positive one.

The target variable Y is obtained using a rule based on the value of the first attribute. If the first attribute is positive one, Y is calculated using a linear combination of the second, third, and fourth attributes plus random noise. If the first attribute is negative one, Y is calculated using a different linear combination of the fifth, sixth, and seventh attributes plus random noise.

This dataset is part of a collection of regression datasets. It consists of cases with continuous attributes. The original source is a statistical reference book.
