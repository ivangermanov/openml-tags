This dataset is derived from the original version by removing all instances with missing values in the last attribute. The Bridges dataset is originally not a classification dataset, but it is used extensively in the literature, using the last attribute as the target attribute. However, this attribute has missing values, which may lead to confusing benchmarking results. Therefore, these instances have been removed.

The Bridges dataset is compiled from various sources and was created on August 1, 1990.
