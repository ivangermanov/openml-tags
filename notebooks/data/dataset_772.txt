Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on earthquake-related information and has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem. The conversion process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances based on whether they fall above or below this threshold. This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to the data.

The dataset includes several features related to seismic events, such as the depth of the earthquake's focus, its geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and the newly created binary class label. These features provide valuable information for analyzing and predicting earthquake occurrences and their characteristics.

Researchers and data scientists interested in geophysics, seismology, or machine learning applications in natural disaster prediction may find this dataset particularly useful. The binarized nature of the target variable makes it suitable for various classification algorithms and model evaluation techniques.
