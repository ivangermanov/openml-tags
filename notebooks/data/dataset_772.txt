This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This conversion allows for a more straightforward classification problem. The dataset includes features such as Age and Civil Status, which provide important context for understanding the relationships between variables.
