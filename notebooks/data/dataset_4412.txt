Subsampling of the dataset Eye Movements with Seed equals Two 
Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

The dataset Eye Movements, consisting of forty-four thousand one hundred fifty-seven entries, underwent subsampling with specific parameters. The subsampling process utilized a specified seed value of two for reproducibility purposes. Additionally, the number of rows was capped at two thousand, while the maximum number of columns was set to one hundred. Furthermore, the number of classes was limited to ten.

Generated with the following source code:

This Python function facilitates the subsampling of datasets. It accepts several arguments, including a seed value, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, as well as an option for stratification. The function employs NumPy's default random number generator to ensure randomness.

Initially, the function retrieves the input data and corresponding labels. In cases where the number of unique classes exceeds the specified maximum, the function selects the desired number of classes using a weighted random choice based on their frequency in the dataset. This ensures that the sampled dataset maintains an adequate representation of each class.

Next, the function filters the input data to only include entries corresponding to the selected classes. If necessary, the function then randomly samples columns from the filtered data to reach the specified column limit.

Finally, if the resulting dataset still contains more entries than the maximum allowed, the function employs stratified sampling to select the desired number of rows while maintaining the original class distribution.
