Fruitfly Dataset

This dataset is a designed experiment that examines the relationship between sexual activity and the lifespan of male fruitflies. The experiment involves manipulating the sexual activity of male fruitflies by providing them with either one or eight receptive virgin females per day, and comparing their longevity to that of two control groups. One control group consists of males kept with one or eight newly inseminated females, while the other control group consists of males kept without females.

The dataset contains five variables: ID, Partners, Type, Longevity, and Thorax. The ID variable represents the serial number of each male fruitfly within its respective group. The Partners variable indicates the number of female companions each male has, which can be zero, one, or eight. The Type variable describes the type of companion, which can be a virgin female, a newly inseminated female, or no female. The Longevity variable measures the lifespan of each male fruitfly in days. The Thorax variable represents the length of each male fruitfly's thorax in millimeters.

The story behind the data is that the experiment was conducted to investigate whether increased sexual activity reduces the lifespan of male fruitflies, as has been observed in female fruitflies. The results showed that males supplied with eight virgin females per day had a shorter lifespan than those supplied with one virgin female per day, suggesting a cost of increased reproduction in terms of reduced longevity.

Teachers can use this dataset to teach various statistical concepts, including analysis of variance, classical analysis of covariance, and multiple regression. The dataset is particularly useful for illustrating the importance of considering confounding variables, such as thorax length, when analyzing the relationship between sexual activity and longevity. It also provides opportunities for discussing statistical interactions and the role of intermediate variables.
