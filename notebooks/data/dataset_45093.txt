The Lung dataset is a machine learning dataset related to microarray analysis in transportation biology, consisting of two hundred three instances and five classes.

This dataset was created for classification of human lung carcinomas by mRNA expression profiling, which reveals distinct adenocarcinoma subclasses.

Features of this dataset include various probes for genes involved in different biological processes, such as cell signaling, metabolism, and gene regulation.
