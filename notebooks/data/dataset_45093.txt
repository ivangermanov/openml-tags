Lung Dataset, a microarray dataset, consists of 203 instances and 5 classes. This dataset is a classification of human lung carcinomas by mRNA expression profiling, which reveals distinct adenocarcinoma subclasses. The dataset is a comprehensive collection of gene expression profiles, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer.

The dataset features a wide range of gene expression profiles, including those related to immune response, cell signaling, and metabolism. These profiles are essential for understanding the complex biology of lung cancer and for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians, providing a comprehensive understanding of lung cancer biology and facilitating the development of personalized treatment strategies.
