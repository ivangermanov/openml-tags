Machine learning dataset numerai twenty-eight point six subsampled with seed three, containing two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes, generated with stratification enabled.

This dataset was generated using the following source code:

The function subsample takes in several parameters, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification. It first initializes a random number generator with the given seed value. Then, it selects a uniform sample of classes, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum allowed. It then selects the indices corresponding to these chosen classes and filters the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns, selecting a specified number of columns without replacement. Finally, it applies stratification to ensure an even distribution of classes in the sampled data.

Features of this dataset include attributes zero through twenty-one.
