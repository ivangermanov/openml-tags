Please cite: The data are a subsample of observations from a dataset that originated in a study where air pollution at a road is related to traffic volume and meteorological variables, collected by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. The response variable consists of hourly values of the logarithm of the concentration of NO2 (particles), measured at Alnabru in Oslo, Norway, between October and August. The predictor variables are the logarithm of the number of cars per hour, temperature meters above ground (degree Celsius), wind speed (meters per second), the temperature difference between meters above ground (degree Celsius), wind direction (degrees between and), hour of day and day number from October.

The dataset explores the relationship between air pollution, specifically NO2 concentration, and various factors including traffic volume and weather conditions. The measurements were taken over a period of nearly two years in Oslo, Norway. The study aims to understand how these different variables contribute to air quality in an urban environment, particularly near roadways. The inclusion of both traffic-related and meteorological predictors allows for a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing NO2 levels.
