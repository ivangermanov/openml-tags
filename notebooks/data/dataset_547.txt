The no2 dataset with tags OpenML-Reg19 and study_130 originates from StatLib and was sourced in two thousand four.

This dataset is a subsample of five hundred observations from a larger study where air pollution at a road is related to traffic volume and meteorological variables, collected by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. 

The response variable consists of hourly values of the logarithm of the concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide particles, measured at Alnabru in Oslo, Norway, between October and August. 

The predictor variables are the logarithm of the number of cars per hour, temperature two meters above ground in degree Celsius, wind speed in meters per second, the temperature difference between twenty-five and two meters above ground in degree Celsius, wind direction in degrees between zero and three sixty, hour of day, and day number from October first.
