This multivariate regression dataset is derived from the See Click Predict Fix competition held on Kaggle in 2013. Specifically, it concerns predicting three target variables representing the number of views, clicks, and comments a particular three-one-one issue will receive. The dataset comprises issues collected from four cities in the United States - Oakland, Richmond, New Haven, and Chicago - spanning a twelve-month period.

In this pre-processed version, a random one percent sample of the data has been taken. The features utilized include the duration an issue remained online, the source from which it was created, such as Android or iPhone, and the type of issue, including graffiti, potholes, trash, and others. Additionally, geographical coordinates of the issue, the city where it was published, and the distance from the city center are also included.

All multivalued nominal variables were initially transformed into binary and then rare binary variables, being true for less than one percent of cases, were removed.
