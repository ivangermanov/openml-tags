Cardiac Arrhythmia Database

This dataset aims to determine the type of arrhythmia from ECG recordings. It contains numerous attributes, both linear valued and nominal. The goal is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and classify it into one of sixteen groups. Class refers to 'normal' ECG classes, while the other classes refer to different types of arrhythmia, with the final class encompassing unclassified cases.

Currently, a computer program exists that performs such classification. However, discrepancies arise between the cardiologist's classification and the program's output. Using the cardiologist's assessment as the gold standard, the objective is to minimize these differences through machine learning techniques.

The database includes a wide range of attributes, including age, sex, height, weight, and various ECG measurements such as QRS duration, PR interval, QT interval, T interval, and P interval. It also contains vector angles in degrees on the front plane for QRS, T, P, QRST, and J, as well as heart rate.

Multiple channels (DI, DII, DIII, AVR, AVL, AVF, V to V) are analyzed, measuring wave characteristics like Q wave, R wave, S wave, R' wave, and S' wave. The existence of ragged waves and diphasic derivations are also noted. Amplitude measurements and area calculations (QRSA and QRSTA) are included for each channel.

The class labels range from normal ECG to various arrhythmia types, including ischemic changes, myocardial infarction, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, premature contractions, bundle branch blocks, AV blocks, ventricular hypertrophy, and atrial fibrillation or flutter.

This comprehensive dataset provides a wealth of information for researchers and medical professionals studying cardiac arrhythmias and developing improved diagnostic tools.
