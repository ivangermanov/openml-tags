Audiology Database

This database is a standardized version of the original audiology database. The non-standard set of attributes have been converted to a standard set of attributes according to the rules that follow.

Each property that appears anywhere in the original data or test file has been represented as a separate attribute in this file. A property such as Age Greater Than Sixty is represented as a boolean attribute with values False and True. In most cases, a property of the form X(Y) is represented as a discrete attribute X whose possible values are the various Y's; Air is an example.

There are two exceptions: when only one value of Y appears anywhere, for example Static Normal. In this case, X_Y appears as a boolean attribute. When one case can have two or more values of X, for example History. All possible values of History are treated as separate boolean attributes.

Since boolean attributes only appear as positive conditions, each boolean attribute is assumed to be False unless noted as True. The value of multi-value discrete attributes taken as Unknown unless a value is specified.

The original case identifications, Patient One to Patient Two Hundred in the data file and Test One to Test Twenty-Six in the test file, have been added as a unique identifier attribute.
