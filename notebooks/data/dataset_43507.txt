The Tweets of Wisdom

In recent years, Twitter has become one of the most popular social media platforms, accommodating a diverse range of people and thoughts, from celebrity status to government policies. Among these diverse thoughts, there are many Twitter accounts that tweet self-help thoughts, often related to improving one's life and excelling at what one does. I delved into the world of these tweets to search for common themes and patterns. As a result, I decided to collect and analyze these tweets to better understand the words of wisdom they convey.

I collected the data using the Tweepy Application Programming Interface. The dataset contains tweets, retweets, and retweets with comments from a selection of authors. The data includes more authors than initially selected, as every retweet from any of the selected authors is stored as a tweet from the original author. Additionally, every retweet with a comment includes tags and the original content of the retweet.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Stack Overflow, which provided invaluable assistance at every stage of this project, from data collection to analysis. I also appreciate the Tweepy API, which made it significantly easier to fetch tweets.

I was inspired to collect this dataset for several reasons, primarily to understand the similarities between these tweets and to identify the factors that make some tweets go viral. I explore these questions and many more in my analysis.

The dataset features include the author's handle, the date and time the tweet was created, the number of likes, the number of retweets, and the content of the tweet.
