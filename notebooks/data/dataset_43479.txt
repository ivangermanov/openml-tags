USA Airport Dataset
Tags: 

This dataset is a comprehensive record of United States domestic flights from nineteen ninety to two thousand nine. It has been sourced from the OpenFlights website, which boasts an extensive database of various travel mediums across the globe. I stumbled upon this dataset while preparing for a hackathon and thought it was worthy of being included in Kaggle's dataset list.

What's in it? This dataset comprises a multitude of attributes that provide valuable insights into the world of domestic air travel. The attributes present in the dataset include the origin airport, destination airport, origin city, destination city, number of passengers transported, number of seats available, number of flights between origin and destination, distance flown, and the date of flight. Additionally, the dataset also includes the population of the origin and destination cities as reported by the United States Census.

Where did you get it? I would like to extend my gratitude to the original creators of this dataset for their diligent effort in collecting and compiling this data. I plan to update this dataset to include additional attributes that may reveal more information about this dataset.
