Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Partners, Type, Thorax, Sleep, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Fruitfly, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified two-class classification problem. The process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using this as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean were labeled as positive, while those above were designated as negative. This transformation allows for binary classification tasks and myth-busting analyses.

The dataset includes several features related to fruitfly characteristics and behaviors, such as the number of partners, body type, thorax measurements, and sleep patterns. The newly created binary class serves as the target variable for classification purposes. This modified version of the dataset is particularly useful for various studies and research endeavors in the field of entomology and machine learning.
