Pollen Dataset 

This dataset is a binarized regression problem, originating from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. In an effort to debunk common myths, this dataset has been used in various studies, including Mythbusting Study One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, and Study Seven.

The dataset has undergone a transformation, converting its numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as Negative, denoted by 'N'.

The dataset comprises several key features, including Ridge Width, Nutlet Border, Crack Length, Weight, and Density, which ultimately influence the binary classification outcome.
