The dataset robert has been subsampled with a seed value of three. This subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset until a maximum of ten classes were reached. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to filter the data.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled until a maximum of one hundred columns were reached. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset.

If the number of rows in the resulting dataset exceeded two thousand, the data was further split using stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution was maintained.

The resulting dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical features. The categorical features have been converted to strings for compatibility with OpenML.
