Name: Robert Subsampling Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Robert dataset with stratification

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Robert dataset, with a focus on stratified sampling to maintain class balance. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while preserving its essential characteristics.

The dataset features a carefully selected subset of columns, ensuring that the most informative and relevant features are retained. The stratified sampling approach guarantees that the class distribution is maintained, which is crucial for accurate model performance.

The resulting dataset is a balanced and representative subset of the original Robert dataset, making it ideal for machine learning model training and evaluation.
