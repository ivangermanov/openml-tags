New York City Bike Trip Duration 

Tags: Earth Science, Machine Learning 

Context 
Inspired by the New York City Taxi Trip Duration playground, I created a dataset using the publicly available data. Citi Bike is a bike-sharing service available in New York City that permits easy and affordable bike trips. They regularly release data about such trips, including starting and ending stations, starting and ending time, duration of the trip, and a few other variables. It closely resembles the data available about taxi trips, and I think it could be interesting to compare the two datasets.

Content 
The dataset covers bike trips from the first six months of the year. The data has been anonymized and arranged to follow the Taxi Trip dataset categories and nomenclature. Notice that the starting and ending points of each trip correspond to one of the bike stations spread around New York City, most of them in Manhattan, with a substantial subset in Brooklyn.

Acknowledgments 
This dataset is the property of New York City Bike Share, which operates New York City’s Citi Bike bicycle-sharing service.

Inspiration 
Is there a correlation between the duration of bike rides and taxi rides? Weather or traffic conditions could affect both in a similar way. Is it always faster to get a cab?
