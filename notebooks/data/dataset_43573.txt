New York City Bike Trip Duration

Tags: Context

Inspired by the New York City Taxi Trip Duration playground, I created a dataset using publicly available data from the City Bike website. City Bike is a bike sharing service available in New York City that permits easy and affordable bike trips. They regularly release data about such trips, including starting and ending stations, starting and ending time, duration of the trip, and a few other variables. This dataset closely resembles the data available about taxi trips, and I think it could be interesting to compare the two datasets.

The dataset covers City Bike trips from the first six months of the year. The data has been anonymized and arranged to follow the Taxi Trip dataset categories and nomenclature. Notice that the starting and ending point of each trip correspond to one of the City Bike stations spread around New York City, most of them in Manhattan, with a substantial subset in Brooklyn.

Inspiration

Is there a correlation between the duration of bike rides and taxi rides? Weather or traffic conditions could affect both in a similar way. Is it always faster to get a cab?
