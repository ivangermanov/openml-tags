Vehicle Norm Dataset
Tags: study_16

This dataset is a normalized version of the vehicle dataset. It originates from the UCI repository and focuses on classifying vehicle silhouettes into four types based on features extracted from the silhouettes. The vehicles can be viewed from various angles.

The purpose of this dataset is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicles using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The problem type is classification.

The data was originally gathered at the Turing Institute in 1986-1987, partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The initial goal was to develop a method for distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by applying an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Shape features extracted from example silhouettes were used to generate a classification rule tree through computer induction.

This object recognition strategy successfully discriminated between silhouettes of model cars, vans, and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation. The rule tree classification performance compared favorably to Minimum Distance Classifier and k-Nearest Neighbor statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency.

The features were extracted from the silhouettes using the Hierarchical Image Processing System (HIPS) extension BINATTS. This system extracts a combination of scale-independent features utilizing both classical moments-based measures and heuristic measures. The measures include scaled variance, skewness, kurtosis about the major/minor axes, hollows, circularity, rectangularity, and compactness.

Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double-decker bus, Chevrolet van, Saab 9000, and an Opel Manta 400. This combination was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van, and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, while distinguishing between the cars would be more challenging.

The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation. The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface and painted matte black to minimize highlights. The images were captured, thresholded, and processed to remove image noise.

The dataset includes multiple sets of images covering full 360-degree rotations of each vehicle, with additional sets captured at different camera elevations. The total number of examples in the dataset is 946, with 240 examples each for Opel, Saab, and bus classes, and 226 examples for the van class.

The dataset contains 18 attributes, including measures such as compactness, circularity, distance circularity, radius ratio, aspect ratios, scatter ratio, elongatedness, rectangularity, scaled variance, skewness, kurtosis, and hollows ratio.
