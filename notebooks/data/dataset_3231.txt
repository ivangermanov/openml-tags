QSAR-TID-10979 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10979. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1671 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 is a single protein, also known as FLT, FLT1, FLT-1, Fms-like Tyrosine Kinase 1, FRT. It is a protein target classification of 1. Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase VEGFR family.

The protein is involved in angiogenesis, monocyte chemotaxis, protein phosphorylation, chemotaxis, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, positive regulation of phospholipase C activity, positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, phosphorylation, cell migration, peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, cell differentiation, positive regulation of protein modification process, positive regulation of kinase activity, cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 signaling pathway, vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, positive regulation of MAP kinase activity, positive regulation of MAPK cascade, positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, positive regulation of angiogenesis, protein autophosphorylation, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway, blood vessel morphogenesis, embryonic morphogenesis, negative regulation of vascular endothelial cell proliferation, and hyaloid vascular plexus regression.
