QSAR-TID-12017 Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12017. It has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by nine hundred ninety-six FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.
