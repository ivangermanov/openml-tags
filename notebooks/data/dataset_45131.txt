**Child Bayesian Network**

This sample network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. The Child Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium network consisting of twenty nodes and twenty-five arcs, with a total of two hundred thirty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is three, and the average degree is two point five, with a maximum in-degree of two.

This network represents a probabilistic model for diagnosing disease in a child, incorporating various factors such as age, symptoms, medical test results, and underlying conditions. It is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of machine learning and life science.

The network includes variables related to cardiac mixing, lung flow, carbon dioxide levels, oxygen saturation, chest x-rays, and other relevant medical factors. These variables interact with each other in complex ways, allowing the network to capture subtle patterns and relationships between them.
