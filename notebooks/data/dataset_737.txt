Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version 1). This dataset converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Natural logarithm of Votes divided by Population, Population, Education, Houses, Income, X Coordinate, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Space GA, is a binarized regression problem used for various studies and mythbusting purposes. It represents a modified version of an original dataset, where the primary alteration involves transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification. This transformation is achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean.

The dataset encompasses several features that provide insights into demographic and socioeconomic factors. These include population-related metrics, educational statistics, housing information, income data, and geographical coordinates. The final feature, Binary Class, represents the transformed target variable, which now consists of two categories: positive ('P') and negative ('N').

Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation and acknowledge its origins as a binarized adaptation of a pre-existing dataset. The Space GA dataset serves as a valuable resource for exploring binary classification problems and conducting comparative analyses between regression and classification approaches.
