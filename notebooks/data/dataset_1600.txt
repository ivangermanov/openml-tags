SPECTF Tags: study, study, uci

This dataset describes the diagnosis of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Patients are classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. The database consists of SPECT image sets from patients, which were processed to extract features summarizing the original images. This resulted in continuous feature patterns for each patient. The CLIP algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns, achieving accuracy comparable to cardiologists' diagnoses.

The SPECTF heart data is a merged version of separate train and test sets typically distributed. On OpenML, this train-test split can be found as one of the possible tasks. It's worth noting that the SPECT heart data provides binary data for the same classification task.

The dataset originates from the University of Colorado at Denver and the Medical College of Ohio. It was donated on October, and is considered a good dataset for testing machine learning algorithms. It contains instances described by attributes, with the predicted attribute being OVERALL DIAGNOSIS (binary).

The data has no missing values. The class attribute is binary, while all other attributes are continuous, representing counts in various regions of interest (ROI) during rest and stress conditions. These continuous attributes have integer values ranging from to.

The dataset is divided into training data and testing data. This version corrects a previous error where datasets were incorrectly merged, resulting in the correct number of instances.

Features include counts in various ROIs during rest and stress, labeled as FR and FS respectively, where R stands for rest and S for stress. These features provide detailed information about different regions of the heart under varying conditions.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating machine learning models in medical imaging and diagnosis, particularly in the field of cardiac health assessment.
