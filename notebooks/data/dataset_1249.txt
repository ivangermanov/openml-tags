News Twenty Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Concept Drift, Life Science

This dataset is part of the LIBSVM data repository. It was originally created for a research paper titled "Learning to Filter Netnews" and published in the Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning.

The dataset has undergone preprocessing, which involved splitting the data into training and testing sets with an eighty-twenty ratio. The dataset contains a large number of features, including attributes one through one hundred, among others.

The News Twenty dataset is related to the twenty newsgroups problem, which involves classifying news articles into different categories. The dataset is useful for machine learning tasks, particularly those involving concept drift, which occurs when the underlying distribution of the data changes over time.
