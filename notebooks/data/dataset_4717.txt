This dataset is a subsampled version of the Shuttle dataset, which originally had forty thousand six hundred eighty-five instances. The subsampling was done using a seed value of two, which ensures reproducibility of the results. The maximum number of rows was set to two thousand, while the maximum number of columns was limited to one hundred. Furthermore, the number of classes was restricted to ten.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the dataset were identified. Since there were more than ten classes, a random selection of ten classes was made, taking into account their frequency of occurrence in the dataset. This ensured that the selected classes were representative of the entire dataset.

Next, the rows corresponding to the selected classes were extracted from the dataset. After that, a random selection of columns was made, ensuring that the number of columns did not exceed one hundred. Finally, a random sample of two thousand rows was taken from the resulting dataset, while maintaining the class distribution.

The resulting dataset has the same characteristics as the original Shuttle dataset, with the exception of the reduced number of rows, columns, and classes. This subsampled dataset is suitable for machine learning experiments that require smaller datasets without sacrificing representativeness.
