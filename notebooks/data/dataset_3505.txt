QSAR-TID-249 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 249. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1487 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The MetaQSAR project was conducted in September 2015.

This dataset is related to the Endothelin receptor ET-A, which is a single protein target. The preferred name is Endothelin receptor ET-A, and it has several synonyms, including EDNRA, Endothelin-1 receptor, and Endothelin receptor type A.

The Endothelin receptor ET-A is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, blood vessel remodeling, and response to hypoxia.

Several compounds have been identified as Endothelin receptor ET-A antagonists, including Sparsentan, Atrasentan, Zibotentan, Nebentan, and Enrasentan. These compounds have been shown to have various effects on the body, including reducing blood pressure and improving cardiovascular function.

The Endothelin receptor ET-A is also involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein phosphorylation.

The dataset provides a comprehensive understanding of the Endothelin receptor ET-A and its role in various biological processes. It can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases related to the Endothelin receptor ET-A.
