Win95pts Bayesian Network. Sample 0.

The Win95pts Bayesian network repository references the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository discrete large dataset. This dataset contains a significant number of nodes and arcs, which are critical components of Bayesian networks.

The network consists of a substantial seventy-six nodes and one hundred twelve arcs, which are essential for modeling complex relationships between variables. Furthermore, the network has a considerable five hundred seventy-four parameters, which are used to quantify these relationships.

In terms of node connectivity, the average Markov blanket size is approximately six, indicating that each node has around six neighboring nodes. The average degree of the nodes is approximately three, suggesting that most nodes have three edges connected to them. The maximum in-degree of seven indicates that some nodes have a higher number of incoming edges.

Some of the notable features of this network include Print Port, Network Print, Printer Driver, and Desktop Printing Speed, among others.
