The Texas Winter Storm 2021 Tweets dataset is a collection of social media posts gathered during the devastating winter storm that hit Texas in February 2021. This severe weather event, also known as Winter Storm Uri, brought widespread destruction, including massive power outages, water and food shortages, and hazardous weather conditions.

This dataset comprises tweets from influential users, typically those with a large following, although some posts from less prominent users are also included. The tweets were posted during the crisis week, providing valuable insights into public sentiment and concerns.

Inspired by previous projects, this dataset aims to apply natural language processing techniques to understand user opinions on crisis management. By analyzing these tweets, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how people respond to natural disasters and identify areas for improvement in emergency response strategies.

The dataset features a range of attributes, including tweet identifiers, usernames, tweet texts, hashtags, creation dates, and user information such as follower counts, friend lists, favorite tweets, and descriptions.
