QSAR-TID-100075 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TGF-beta receptor type II, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TGF-beta receptor type II. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The TGF-beta receptor type II is a single protein, also known as TbetaR-II, TGF-beta receptor type-2, TGF-beta receptor type II, TGF-beta type II receptor, and TGFBR2. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TKL protein kinase group/TKL protein kinase STKR family/TKL protein kinase STKR Type two subfamily.

The TGF-beta receptor type II is involved in various biological processes, including blood vessel development, branching involved in blood vessel morphogenesis, vasculogenesis, in utero embryonic development, heart looping, positive regulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation, and lens development in camera-type eye. It is also involved in protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway, and transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway.

The TGF-beta receptor type II has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase activity, transforming growth factor beta receptor activity, and protein binding. It is also involved in various cellular components, including extracellular region, extracellular space, cytosol, plasma membrane, caveola, and membrane raft.
