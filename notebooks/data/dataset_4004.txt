This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TGF Beta Receptor Type Two, and it has multiple rows and numerous features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
