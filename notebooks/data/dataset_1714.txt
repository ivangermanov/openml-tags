This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Three, and it has seventy-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and nine hundred twenty-six more...
