The QSAR-TID-38 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID thirty-eight. It has seventy rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset contains information about a protein target, specifically epoxide hydrolase one, also known as EPHX one. It is a single protein and its preferred name is epoxide hydrolase one. Its synonyms include EPHX, EPHX one, epoxide hydratase, and epoxide hydrolase one.

It is an enzyme that belongs to the serine protease S thirty-three family. It is involved in various biological processes, including lipid metabolic process, cellular aromatic compound metabolic process, xenobiotic metabolic process, response to toxic substance, response to organic cyclic compound, arachidonic acid metabolic process, aromatic compound catabolic process, and epoxide metabolic process.

It has various functions, including catalytic activity, epoxide hydrolase activity, protein binding, hydrolase activity, ether hydrolase activity, and cis-stilbene-oxide hydrolase activity.

Keywords: QSAR, epoxide hydrolase, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR, enzyme, serine protease.
