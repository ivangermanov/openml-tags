The QSAR-TID-17084 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: seventeen thousand eighty-four, and it has multiple rows and features including identifiers and a class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: seventeen thousand eighty-four.

The kappa opioid receptor is a single protein that is also known as kappa-type opioid receptor. It is found in the plasma membrane and is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, behavior, locomotory behavior, sensory perception of pain, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting opioid receptor signaling pathway, and regulation of saliva secretion.

This receptor has G protein-coupled receptor activity, G protein-coupled opioid receptor activity, and dynorphin receptor activity. It is classified as a kappa opioid receptor and is involved in various biological processes.

Features include molecule identifiers and molecular fingerprints.
