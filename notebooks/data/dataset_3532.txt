QSAR-TID-19903 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19903. The dataset has forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin three receptor, also known as Neurokinin B receptor, Neuromedin-K receptor, NK-three R, NK-three receptor, and NKR. The Neurokinin three receptor is a single protein, and its preferred name is Neurokinin three receptor. It belongs to the species group Cavia porcellus.

The Neurokinin three receptor is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. It is involved in signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and tachykinin receptor signaling pathway. The receptor has transmembrane signaling receptor activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and tachykinin receptor activity.
