Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Age, Civil, Can/US, Binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, focusing on mythbusting and various studies. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification, where instances below the mean are labeled as positive and those above as negative. This conversion allows for a simplified analysis of the data, potentially revealing insights that may not have been apparent in the continuous numeric form. The features included in this dataset provide information on age, civil status, geographical location (Canada/US), and the binary classification outcome.
