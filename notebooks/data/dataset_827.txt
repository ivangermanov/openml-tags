Collins Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting 

The Collins Dataset has undergone a transformation to create a binarized version of the original data set. In this process, the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by re-labeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

Originally, this dataset consisted of various features including Text, whether the narrative was written in the First Person, instances of Inner Thinking, thinking positively or negatively, and thinking ahead or back. It also included Reasoning, sharing Social Ties, engaging in Direct Activity, Interacting, Notifying, following Linear Guidance, using Word Pictures, understanding Spatial Intervals, describing Motion, recalling Past Events, recognizing Time Intervals, and shifting between Events. Furthermore, it examined Text Coverage, different Genres, and the use of Counters.
