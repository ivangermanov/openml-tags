QSAR-TID-10586 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet Activating Factor Receptor, and it has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Platelet Activating Factor Receptor. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Platelet Activating Factor Receptor is a single protein, also known as PAFr, PAF-R, Platelet-Activating Factor Receptor, and Ptafr. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a Small molecule receptor. It is involved in Lipid-like ligand receptor activity and is classified as a one Membrane receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of cellular extravasation, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in response to symbiotic bacterium, positive regulation of phospholipase C activity, lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, and response to lipopolysaccharide.
