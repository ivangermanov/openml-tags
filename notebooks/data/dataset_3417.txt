QSAR-TID-100436 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100436. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the C-C chemokine receptor type eight, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as CC chemokine receptor, CHEMR one, C-C chemokine receptor type eight, C-C CKR-eight, and CC-CKR-eight. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and peptide receptor family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including chemotaxis, immune response, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration and calcium-mediated signaling.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the C-C chemokine receptor type eight.
