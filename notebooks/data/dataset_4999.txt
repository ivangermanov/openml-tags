Andes Bayesian Network Sample 3

This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete very large dataset.

The Andes dataset has two hundred twenty-three nodes and three hundred thirty-eight arcs. It also has one thousand one hundred fifty-seven parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately five point six one, and the average degree is approximately three point zero three. The maximum in-degree is six.

The Andes dataset is used for modeling human activities and involves machine learning techniques. It focuses on student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks.

Features of this dataset include goal-oriented nodes, resolution nodes, choice nodes, identification nodes, and many others. These nodes are interconnected to represent various aspects of human behavior and decision-making processes.

Keywords: Bayesian Network, Machine Learning, Human Activities, Student Modeling, Coached Problem Solving.
