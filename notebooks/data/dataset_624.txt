The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from Stochastic Gradient Boosting. 

These datasets are coded as "Fri C0 100 5", where Fri represents the Friedman dataset, C0 represents the colinearity degree, one hundred represents the sample number, and five represents the feature number. 

The Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. This function is as follows: y equals ten times sin of pi times x one times x two plus twenty times x three minus point five squared equals ten times X four plus five times X five plus e.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to the colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies, with only the first five features being related to the output; the rest are completely random. The number of samples also varies. Colinearity degrees vary, with some datasets having no colinearity and others having up to four degrees of colinearity.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying the number of features, the number of samples, and the colinearity degree.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
