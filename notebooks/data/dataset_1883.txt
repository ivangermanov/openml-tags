This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tid Two Fourteen, and it has a large number of rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Px C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Zero Two Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September Two Thousand Fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version Seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tid Two Fourteen.
