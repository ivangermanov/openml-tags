The dataset BNG (lymph) is an artificial dataset tagged as BNG. It contains features related to the lymphatic system and various lymph node characteristics. These features include lymphatics, blockages in the afferent lymphatic vessels, lymph cells, and lymph system. The dataset also covers bypass mechanisms, extravasation processes, and regeneration patterns. Early uptake in lymph nodes, as well as diminished and enlarged lymph nodes, are recorded. Changes in lymph composition, nodal defects, structural alterations, and special morphological forms are documented. The dataset tracks dislocation and exclusion of nodes, along with the number of nodes involved. Classification is included as a feature.
