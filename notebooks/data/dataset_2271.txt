QSAR-TID-11066 Dataset Information 

Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11066. It has twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median pXC50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
