The Iris dataset, categorized under Health and Medicine, has several notable characteristics. Specifically, this dataset consists of five prominent features: Sepal Length, which refers to the length of the sepal, one of the outer parts of the flower; Petal Width, which represents the width of the petal; and Species, which categorizes the different types of flowers present in the dataset. Notably, two features, namely Sepal Width and Petal Length, have been intentionally disregarded.
