**Link Bayesian Network**

The Link Bayesian Network is a discrete very large network referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository.

This network consists of a significant number of nodes and arcs, with a substantial number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is moderate, while the average degree is relatively low.

The maximum in-degree of the network is also relatively low. This network is characterized by its complex structure, with many nodes and arcs interacting with each other.

**Features**

The network comprises various features, including those related to genetic linkage analysis, pedigree data, and probabilistic graphical models.
