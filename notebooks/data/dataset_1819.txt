QSAR-TID-11409 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11409. The data was sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen. 

The dataset consists of nine hundred twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, followed by FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints numbered from zero to nine hundred ninety-eight.
