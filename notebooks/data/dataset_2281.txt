MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-11261

Tags: Earth Science, Meteorology, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11261. The dataset has 748 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
