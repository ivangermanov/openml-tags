QSAR-TID-10904 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10904. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 483 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein is Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase RAF, also known as cRaf, Proto-oncogene c-RAF, RAF, Raf-1, and RAF1. It is a single protein that belongs to the protein kinase group and TKL protein kinase RAF family.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including the MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. It is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase RAF inhibitors.
