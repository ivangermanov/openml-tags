Insurance Bayesian Network Sample Six 

This Bayesian network repository reference is available online. The Insurance Bayesian Network has twenty-seven nodes and fifty-two arcs, with one thousand eight parameters. On average, each node has a Markov blanket size of approximately five point nineteen and an average degree of three point eighty-five. The maximum in-degree of any node is three.

This Bayesian network model was designed to adapt to probabilistic networks with hidden variables. It is a powerful tool for machine learning and life science applications. 

Features of this model include driver history, driving skill, age, ruggedness of automobile, mileage, vehicle year, insurance liability cost, damage to this car, anti-theft devices, driver quality, risk aversion, good student discounts, ownership of other cars, make and model, accidents, socioeconomic status, home base, property cost, car value, anti-lock brakes, cost of this car, cost of other cars, theft, airbags, medical costs, senior training, and cushioning.
