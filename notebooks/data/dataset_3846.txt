QSAR-TID-103780 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103780. The dataset has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Oxoeicosanoid Receptor One, also known as Five-Oxo-ETE G-Protein Coupled Receptor, GPR One Seventy, G-Protein Coupled Receptor R Five Twenty-Seven, and G-Protein Coupled Receptor TG One Zero One Nine. The target is a single protein, and its preferred name is Oxoeicosanoid Receptor One. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family A G-Protein Coupled Receptor, and a Small Molecule Receptor. It is also a Lipid-Like Ligand Receptor, and a Leukotriene Receptor.

The target is classified as a One Membrane Receptor, Family A G-Protein Coupled Receptor, Small Molecule Receptor, Lipid-Like Ligand Receptor, and Leukotriene Receptor. It is described as being involved in signal transduction, G-Protein Coupled Receptor signaling pathway, and adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G-Protein Coupled Receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
