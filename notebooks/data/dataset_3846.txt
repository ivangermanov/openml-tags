I desired a highly imbalanced dataset to share with others, and this one fits the bill perfectly. An imbalanced dataset typically refers to a classification problem where the number of observations per class is not equally distributed, often resulting in a large amount of data or observations for one class, referred to as the majority class, and significantly fewer observations for one or more other classes, referred to as the minority classes.

For instance, in this dataset, there are substantially more samples of fully paid borrowers compared to those who did not fully pay their loans. The full Lending Club data is available on their website.

For companies like Lending Club, accurately predicting whether or not a loan will default is crucial. This dataset contains historical data, allowing users to build a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of default for future loans. As you will notice, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes numerous features that make this problem even more challenging.

Features include credit policy, purpose, interest rate, installment, annual income, debt-to-income ratio, FICO score, days with credit line, revolving balance, revolving utilization, inquiries last six months, delinquencies two years, and public record.
