okcupid-stem Seed Four Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the okcupid-stem dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes and columns from the original dataset.

The dataset has been stratified to ensure an even distribution of classes. This means that the sampling process took into account the class labels and attempted to maintain a consistent proportion of each class in the resulting dataset.

The subsampling process involved selecting a specified number of rows and columns from the original dataset. The column selection process involved choosing a specified number of column indices uniformly at random. The row selection process involved concatenating the selected columns with the class labels and then using a stratified sampling approach to select the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset contains a range of features, including demographic information such as age, body type, education level, ethnicity, height, income, location, and occupation. It also includes lifestyle and preference information such as diet, drinking habits, drug use, offspring, orientation, pet ownership, religious beliefs, sexual preference, star sign, smoking habits, spoken languages, and relationship status.
