Tags: This dataset contains moonrise, moonset, and lunar phase timings for every date from two thousand five to two thousand seventeen for London, United Kingdom; collected from Time and Date.

Inspiration

This data can be used to study the effects of the lunar cycle on any other event of interest. One interesting application for which this dataset was created is to find the correlation of full moon timings with road accidents, to test the Lunar Lunacy effect! The creator is eager to see what other creative uses it can have, as the possibilities seem endless.

Note: Since only one city can be chosen to retrieve results from the source, London in the United Kingdom was selected as the geographical location. It is noteworthy that moonrise and moonset times will differ for different locations in the United Kingdom, despite being in the same time zone, due to differences in solar time (in simpler words, differences in horizon levels). Yet, these differences in timings will still be less than thirty minutes (as observed when comparing the contrasts between eastern and western locations of the United Kingdom). Therefore, if precise timing is not required, these timings can be used to account for the entire United Kingdom. Moreover, the primary moon phases occur at a specific moment in time, so phase timings will always be the same for every location throughout the United Kingdom.
