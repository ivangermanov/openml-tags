Subsampling of the dataset KC One with Seed Three 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original KC One dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes were representative of the overall distribution. 

If the number of unique classes exceeded the maximum allowed, a random selection of classes was made based on their frequency of occurrence. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the original dataset, resulting in a reduced dataset with only the relevant samples.

Furthermore, if the number of columns in the filtered dataset exceeded the maximum allowed, a uniform sampling of columns was performed to reduce the dimensionality. This involved randomly selecting a specified number of columns from the dataset, while ensuring that the resulting subset retained a good representation of the original features.

Finally, if the resulting dataset still had more rows than desired, a stratified sampling approach was employed to further reduce the size of the dataset. This ensured that the final subsampled dataset maintained an optimal balance between class representation and overall size.

The resulting dataset consists of a carefully curated selection of features, including location, volume, edge volume, internal volume, node count, volume, length, degree, incidence, edge, and tree metrics, among others.
