Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses random sampling to select the desired number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining the original distribution of the data.

The function first selects a specified number of classes from the original dataset using random sampling with replacement. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it selects a specified number of columns from the filtered data using random sampling without replacement. If the number of columns in the filtered data is less than or equal to the specified number, it uses all the columns.

Finally, it selects a specified number of rows from the filtered data using stratified sampling to maintain the original distribution of the data. If stratified sampling is not required, it uses random sampling without replacement.
