**Mildew Bayesian Network**

This Bayesian network repository reference is a discrete medium-sized network. It consists of thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs, resulting in a total of five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five seven, while the average degree is around two point six three. Furthermore, the maximum in-degree is three.

The Mildew Bayesian Network is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning and transportation. This network provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex relationships between various factors influencing mildew growth in winter wheat.

The network features a range of variables, including microclimate, leaf area index, photo, and more. These factors interact with each other in complex ways, making the Mildew Bayesian Network an essential tool for anyone seeking to better understand and manage mildew in winter wheat.
