Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

The Delta Ailerons dataset focuses on aircraft control surfaces and their impact on flight dynamics. It includes various measurements related to aircraft motion and orientation, such as roll rate, pitch rate, current pitch, current roll, and the difference in roll rate. These parameters are crucial for understanding and analyzing aircraft behavior during flight.

The binarization process applied to this dataset transforms the continuous target variable into a binary classification problem. This modification allows for the application of classification algorithms and techniques, potentially revealing new insights or patterns in the data that may not have been apparent in the original regression format.

Researchers and data scientists working with this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and consider the implications of the binarization process on their analyses and conclusions. The dataset's versatility makes it suitable for various studies in aeronautics, machine learning, and data science.

Features included in the dataset are Roll Rate, Pitch Rate, Current Pitch, Current Roll, Difference in Roll Rate, and Binary Class.
