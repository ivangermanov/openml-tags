**MetaQSAR Project**

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Eleven. The dataset has thirty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent Folded Circular Fingerprint One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, Folded Circular Fingerprint Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Zero, Folded Circular Fingerprint Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit One, Folded Circular Fingerprint Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Two, and so on.
