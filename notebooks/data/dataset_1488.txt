Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset

This dataset comprises a range of biomedical voice measurements from individuals, with the primary objective of discriminating between healthy people and those suffering from Parkinson's disease. The dataset consists of recordings from thirty-one people, twenty-three of whom have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Each column in the table represents a specific voice measurement, while each row corresponds to one of the nineteen-five voice recordings from these individuals. The "name" column contains the subject's name and recording number.

The main aim of this dataset is to differentiate between healthy individuals and those afflicted with Parkinson's disease, based on the "status" column, which is set to zero for healthy individuals and one for those with Parkinson's disease.

The attribute information includes matrix column entries, such as:

* Name: ASCII subject name and recording number
* MDVP Fo (Hertz): average vocal fundamental frequency
* MDVP Fhi (Hertz): maximum vocal fundamental frequency
* MDVP Flo (Hertz): minimum vocal fundamental frequency
* MDVP Jitter (percent) and MDVP Jitter (Absolute): several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
* MDVP RAP and MDVP PPQ and Jitter DDP: measures of variation in fundamental frequency
* MDVP Shimmer and MDVP Shimmer decibel and Shimmer APQ three and Shimmer APQ five and MDVP APQ and Shimmer DDA: several measures of variation in amplitude
* NHR and HNR: two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
* Status: health status of the subject (one indicates Parkinson's disease, zero indicates healthy)
* RPDE and D two: two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
* DFA: signal fractal scaling exponent
* Spread one, spread two, PPE: three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation
