Abstract: Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset

Source: The dataset was created by the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.

Data Set Information: This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from individuals, some with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of many voice recordings from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to the "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD. Further details are contained in the following reference.

Attribute Information: Matrix column entries (attributes):
name - ASCII subject name and recording number
MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP:Jitter(%), MDVP:Jitter(Abs), MDVP:RAP, MDVP:PPQ, Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
MDVP:Shimmer, MDVP:Shimmer(dB), Shimmer:APQ3, Shimmer:APQ5, MDVP:APQ, Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude
NHR, HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy
RPDE, D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent
spread1, spread2, PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation
