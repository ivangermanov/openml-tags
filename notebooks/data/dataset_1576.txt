MetaQSAR project - September 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.
