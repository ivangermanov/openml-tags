The SoilHydroDB dataset provides global soil hydraulic properties essential for various geoscience applications. It comprises an extensive collection of measurements gathered from published literature and other credible sources, which have undergone rigorous standardization and quality control procedures.

This comprehensive database contains three primary soil hydraulic properties: Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity, Water Content at thirty-three kilopascals and less than two millimeters, and Water Content at one thousand five hundred kilopascals and less than two millimeters.

The dataset includes essential site information, such as site observation date, geographic coordinates, laboratory sample number, layer sequence, horizon designation, and horizon boundaries. It also provides detailed descriptions of soil texture, including clay, silt, and sand percentages, as well as organic carbon, pH levels, and cation exchange capacity.
