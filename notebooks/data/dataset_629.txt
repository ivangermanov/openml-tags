This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The classification is based on the mean value of the target feature, where instances below the mean are labeled as Positive and those above the mean are labeled as Negative.
