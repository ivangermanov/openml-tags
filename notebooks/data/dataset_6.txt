Liver Disorders

Tags: Health, Medicine

This dataset consists of records of single male individuals, each containing six blood test results that are believed to be indicative of liver disorders potentially caused by excessive alcohol consumption.

The first five variables are all blood tests, including mean corpuscular volume, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. These tests are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that may arise from excessive drinking.

It is important to note that the seventh field, often referred to as the selector, has been widely misinterpreted in the past as a dependent variable representing the presence or absence of a liver disorder. However, this interpretation is incorrect. The seventh field was actually created by researchers to split the data into training and testing sets. Therefore, it is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification purposes.

Unfortunately, the dataset does not contain any variable that directly indicates the presence or absence of a liver disorder. To overcome this limitation, researchers have used the sixth field, which represents the number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages consumed daily, as a dependent variable for classification after dichotomizing it.

Because of the widespread misinterpretation of the seventh field in the past, researchers should exercise caution when using this dataset as a classification benchmark and clearly state their methodology to avoid confusion.
