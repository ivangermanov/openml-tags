The objective of this dataset is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. The character images were based on 20 different fonts, and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes, including statistical moments and edge counts, which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.

Typically, the first 16,000 items are used for training, and the resulting model is used to predict the letter category for the remaining 4,000 items. The dataset contains no missing values.

The features include horizontal position of box, vertical position of box, width of box, height of box, total number of on pixels, mean x of on pixels in box, mean y of on pixels in box, mean x variance, mean y variance, mean x y correlation, mean of x * x * y, mean of x * y * y, mean edge count left to right, correlation of x edge with y, mean edge count bottom to top, and correlation of y edge with x.

The target variable is the capital letter, with 26 possible values from A to Z.

This dataset provides a challenging task for machine learning algorithms in the domain of optical character recognition and pattern classification. It offers a large number of samples with various distortions, making it suitable for testing the robustness and generalization capabilities of different classification methods.
