The QSAR-TID-10403 dataset is a collection of QSAR data showcasing activity values of various compounds on the drug target Thrombin. This dataset contains nine hundred thirty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains activity values in units of pseudo-pCI fifty, along with molecular fingerprints and other relevant information about each compound.

The thrombin protein, also known as prothrombin or coagulation factor two, plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process. It is a serine protease that cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin, leading to the formation of blood clots.

In addition to its role in blood coagulation, thrombin has been implicated in various physiological processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, and platelet activation. As such, it is an important target for the development of therapeutic agents aimed at treating cardiovascular diseases and other disorders.

This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop new compounds targeting thrombin, as well as for those interested in understanding the structure-activity relationships of existing compounds.
