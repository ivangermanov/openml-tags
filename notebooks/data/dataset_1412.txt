This dataset contains information related to non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer, focusing on genes identified in the development and international validation studies of a practical molecular assay to predict survival in resected cases. The study aims to elucidate genetic factors associated with different subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, particularly those with ALK-positive status and those negative for EGFR, KRAS, and ALK mutations.

Features include overall survival in years, overall survival event occurrence, histological classification, patient age and sex, as well as various gene expression data points. The gene expression data is represented by probe set identifiers from microarray experiments, measuring the expression levels of specific genes potentially relevant to lung cancer prognosis and treatment response.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers investigating molecular signatures in lung cancer, potentially leading to improved diagnostic and prognostic tools for patients with this disease.
