Title: Wine Quality
Sources Created by: University of Minho and CVRVV

Past Usage:
This dataset was used in a study modeling wine preferences based on physicochemical properties. The research applied data mining methods to analyze red and white wine samples. Inputs included objective tests like pH values, while the output was based on sensory data from wine expert evaluations. Each expert graded wine quality on a scale from very bad to very excellent. Various data mining techniques were employed under a regression approach, with support vector machines achieving the best results. The study computed several metrics and plotted the relative importance of input variables through sensitivity analysis.

Relevant Information:
The datasets contain information on red and white variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic constraints, only physicochemical inputs and sensory outputs are available, excluding data on grape types, wine brands, or pricing. The datasets can be used for classification or regression tasks. The quality classes are ordered but not balanced, with more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. This imbalance suggests potential applications for outlier detection algorithms to identify exceptional wines. Additionally, the relevance of all input variables is uncertain, making feature selection methods potentially valuable.

Number of Instances:
Red wine: first instances
White wine: remaining instances

Number of Attributes:
Eleven input attributes plus one output attribute

Attribute Information:
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.

Output variable (based on sensory data):
Quality (score between zero and ten)

Missing Attribute Values: None

Additional Information:
The datasets offer opportunities for various analytical approaches, including classification, regression, and feature selection. The imbalanced nature of the quality classes presents challenges and opportunities for specialized analytical techniques. Researchers are encouraged to explore the relationships between physicochemical properties and perceived wine quality, potentially uncovering insights valuable to the wine industry.
