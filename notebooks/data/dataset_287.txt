Wine Quality

Tags: Chemistry, Machine Learning, Study

The Wine Quality dataset was created by Paulo Cortez and others in 2009. It consists of two datasets, one for red wine and one for white wine, each containing physicochemical properties and sensory data.

The inputs include objective tests, such as pH values, and the output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert grades the wine quality between zero, very bad, and ten, very excellent.

Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Various metrics were computed, including mean absolute deviation and a confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance.

A sensitivity analysis procedure was also performed to measure the relative importance of the input variables. The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine.

Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available. There is no data about grape types, wine brand, or wine selling price. These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.

Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. It would also be interesting to test feature selection methods, as it is unclear whether all input variables are relevant.

The datasets contain eleven input variables and one output variable. The input variables are based on physicochemical tests, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcohol.

The output variable is based on sensory data and represents the quality of the wine, scored between zero and ten. There are no missing attribute values in the datasets.
