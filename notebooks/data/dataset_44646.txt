Name: King-Rook versus King-Pawn Seed Three

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset King-Rook versus King-Pawn with seed three

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function is defined to take in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of classes from the unique classes in the dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes. The indices where these classes are present are selected, and the dataset is filtered accordingly.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns. It selects a subset of column indices, sorts them, and filters the dataset to include only these columns.

If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the dataset accordingly. It concatenates the dataset with the target variable, performs a train-test split with stratification, and filters the dataset to include only the required number of rows.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string format and returns a dataset with the filtered data, categorical mask, and column names.
