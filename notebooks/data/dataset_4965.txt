**Hailfinder Bayesian Network**

The Hailfinder Bayesian Network is a discrete large network repository referenced in the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository. 

This network consists of a substantial number of nodes and arcs, resulting in a considerable number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size and average degree indicate a moderate level of complexity within the network structure.

The Hailfinder Bayesian Network was designed to forecast severe weather conditions, specifically focused on predicting hail storms. This system utilizes a range of variables and factors to generate predictions, incorporating multiple aspects of meteorology and atmospheric conditions.

**Features:**

The network incorporates various features, including cloud cover, moisture levels, wind patterns, temperature distributions, and other relevant meteorological factors. These features are essential in generating accurate forecasts and predictions within the realm of severe weather events.
