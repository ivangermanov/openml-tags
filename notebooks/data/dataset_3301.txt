QSAR-TID-10909 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10909. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule Chembl ID and median pxc fifty. The rest of the features are FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are not human-readable.
