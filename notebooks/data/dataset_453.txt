The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded according to their characteristics, specifically, the degree of colinearity, sample number, and feature number.

These datasets were designed to test the performance of algorithms in various scenarios, including non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs, and the presence of noise. 

The Friedman function, which generates these datasets, includes both linear and non-linear relations between input and output variables, and a normalized noise is added to the output.

The original Friedman function has five input features, but to measure the effect of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output.

To measure an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity. Colinearity refers to the number of features that depend on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets have varying parameters, including the number of features, ranging from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random.

The number of samples also varies, ranging from one hundred to one thousand. Additionally, the datasets have different colinearity degrees, ranging from zero to four.

For datasets with a high colinearity degree of four, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets have fewer features, specifically five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty.

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

In each dataset, the last attribute is the target variable.
