Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: x box, y box, width, high, on pixels, x bar, y bar, x squared bar, y squared bar, xy bar, x squared y bar, x y squared bar, x edge, x edge versus y, y edge, y edge versus x, binary class

This dataset, known as "Letter," contains information related to letter recognition and classification. It has been processed to convert a multi-class problem into a binary classification task, where the majority class is labeled as positive and all other classes are grouped as negative. The features describe various attributes of letter images, including their dimensions, pixel distributions, and edge characteristics. This binarized version of the dataset is intended for use in machine learning and pattern recognition studies, particularly those focused on binary classification problems.
