Letter Dataset: Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset features include box dimensions, pixel information, and bar measurements. Specifically, these features are the x-box dimension, y-box dimension, width, height, number of pixels, x-bar measurement, y-bar measurement, x squared bar measurement, y squared bar measurement, xy bar measurement, x squared y bar measurement, xy squared bar measurement, x-edge measurement, x edge versus y measurement, y-edge measurement, and y edge versus x measurement.
