This is the historical price data of the Forex Cad Chf from Dukascopy. One instance, or row, is one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset has a data range and does not include weekends, since the Forex is not traded on weekends. The time zone of the feature Time Stamp is Europe Amsterdam.

The class attribute is the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following day, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. This means the class attribute is true when the mean High price is going up the following day, and the class attribute is false when the mean High price is going down or staying the same the following day.
