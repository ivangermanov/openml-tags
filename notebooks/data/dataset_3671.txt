This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: three thousand forty-two, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Folded Circular Fingerprint 1024-bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
