QSAR-TID-30042 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30042. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30042. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the target protein, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The target protein is a single protein, and its preferred name is BMP-two-inducible protein kinase. It has several synonyms, including BIKe, BMP-two-inducible protein kinase, and BMP-two K.

The dataset also contains information on the expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, and Wikipedia entry for the target protein. The expression atlas provides information on the expression of the target protein in different tissues and cells. The go component provides information on the cellular component of the target protein, including its location in the cell. The go function provides information on the molecular function of the target protein, including its role in different biological processes. The go process provides information on the biological process in which the target protein is involved. The Wikipedia entry provides a brief overview of the target protein and its role in different biological processes.
