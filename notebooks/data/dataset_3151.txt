QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule identifiers and median activity values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL IDs and numerous FCFP fingerprint bits. The target protein is a serine/threonine protein kinase, also known as mammalian STE like protein kinase or MST. It is classified as an enzyme in the kinase family, specifically in the STE protein kinase group and MST subfamily.

The protein is found in humans and is involved in various cellular processes. Its components include presence in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and cytosol. The protein has multiple functions, including nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, protein kinase activity, and ATP binding. It participates in numerous biological processes such as cell morphogenesis, blood vessel development, neural tube formation, protein phosphorylation, apoptosis, and signal transduction.

The protein is associated with several Gene Ontology terms related to its cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. It is also linked to entries in databases such as InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe, indicating its structural and functional characteristics.

This QSAR dataset provides valuable information for studying the relationship between molecular structures and their activity on this important kinase target, potentially aiding in drug discovery and development efforts.
