Lung Cancer Data

This dataset contains information on three types of pathological lung cancers. It was originally published in a pattern recognition journal and has been used to illustrate the power of optimal discriminant plane methods in high-dimensional settings.

The data consists of instances with multiple attributes, including one class label and numerous predictive features. All predictive attributes are nominal, taking on integer values from zero to three. There are a few instances of missing attribute values, which have been marked as unknown.

The dataset has been used in various studies comparing classification methods in high-dimensional settings. However, it's important to note that some of the reported results may be biased, as pointed out in subsequent research. Different classification methods applied to this data have yielded varying accuracy rates.

The original data source provided limited information about the individual variables or the specific context in which the data was initially collected. This lack of detailed background information adds a layer of complexity to the interpretation and use of the dataset.

The class distribution is relatively balanced across the three types of lung cancer represented in the data. This balance can be beneficial for certain types of analysis and machine learning applications.

Researchers interested in using this dataset should be aware of its limitations and potential biases. It serves as an interesting case study in the challenges of working with high-dimensional data in medical contexts, particularly when dealing with small sample sizes.

The dataset highlights the importance of careful methodology in analyzing medical data, especially when the number of features is large relative to the number of samples. It also underscores the need for caution when interpreting results from complex classification problems in healthcare settings.
