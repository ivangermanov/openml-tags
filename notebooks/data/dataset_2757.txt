This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex CAD/CHF currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans a period from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute indicates the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent minute relative to the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases in the following minute and false when it decreases or remains unchanged.
