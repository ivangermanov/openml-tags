Gold Rate History in Tamil Nadu (Context)

As we are all aware, according to the observation of economists, the current trend suggests that the yellow metal is performing better as an investment option in comparison to mutual funds, equities, real estate, and fixed deposits. The weak global economic outlook for the entire year might be the reason why gold prices are surging. The yellow metal is considered a financial instrument that does not erode in valuation during periods of economic turbulence. Many global investors are looking for safer investment options, including gold, as fears over a recession continue to grow.

Therefore, we need to forecast the price of gold in the future based on trend or seasonality using historical data from January to September. The historical data has been collected from January to September.
