The QSAR-TID-11408 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11408. This dataset has 1211 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class features, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this source when using the dataset.

The dataset contains information about the c-Jun N-terminal kinase three protein, also known as Mitogen-activated protein kinase ten, which belongs to the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase MAPK family. This enzyme plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and response to light stimuli.

The dataset provides information about the protein's structure, function, and interactions, including its nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and plasma membrane localization. It also includes data about its nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and ATP binding capabilities.

Furthermore, the dataset provides information about the protein's involvement in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, JNK cascade, response to light stimulus, phosphorylation, and rhythmic process regulation.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, c-Jun N-terminal kinase three, Mitogen-activated protein kinase ten, protein kinase, signal transduction, protein phosphorylation.
