Tags: Sub sampling of the dataset Gina generated with the following source code:

The function sub sample takes in several parameters including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification. 

This function first uniformly samples the classes present in the dataset, selecting a specified maximum number of classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the dataset accordingly.

Next, it uniformly samples the columns of the dataset, selecting a specified maximum number of columns. 

If the dataset still has more rows than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data. This ensures that the class distribution is preserved in the sampled dataset.

Finally, the function converts any categorical columns to strings and returns a new dataset object with the sampled data.
