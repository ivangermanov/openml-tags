This dataset, known as Eucalyptus, contains information about various eucalyptus trees and their characteristics. The data has been binarized from its original multi-class format into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was performed by relabeling the majority class as positive and all other classes as negative. The dataset includes a wide range of features related to the trees' physical attributes, environmental conditions, and growth patterns. These features provide valuable insights into the eucalyptus trees' development and survival in different conditions.
