Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Volkert with seed three, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its characteristics. It takes in a seed value, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. The function first samples the classes uniformly, then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. It then samples the columns uniformly if required. If the dataset is still too large, it stratifies the sampling accordingly. The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
