The BoT-IoT dataset was created by designing a realistic network environment in the Cyber Range Lab of the University of New South Wales Canberra Cyber. This environment incorporates a combination of normal and botnet traffic.

Free use of the BoT-IoT dataset for academic research purposes is hereby granted in perpetuity. However, use for commercial purposes requires agreement by the copyright holders.

To ensure proper credit, those intending to use the BoT-IoT dataset should cite the relevant paper that provides detailed information about the dataset.

The dataset includes various features, including packet sequence ID, start time, flags, protocol, source address, source port, destination address, destination port, packet count, byte count, connection state, and other relevant metrics related to network traffic and communication patterns.

Additionally, the dataset includes features related to packet rates, byte rates, protocol-specific metrics, and connection patterns. It also includes labels for attacks, categories, and subcategories.
