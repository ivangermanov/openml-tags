QSAR-TID-11055 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11055. It has forty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
