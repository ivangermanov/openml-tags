QSAR-TID-11055 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 6, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
