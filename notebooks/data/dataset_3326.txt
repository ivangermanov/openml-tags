The second dataset contains hourly traffic volume information for Interstate 94 Westbound at the Minnesota Department of Transportation's ATR station 301, which is located approximately midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota. This dataset includes hourly weather features and holidays to account for their impact on traffic volume. There are no missing values in this dataset.

The variables include whether it was a national holiday or a regional holiday, specifically the Minnesota State Fair. The average temperature is recorded in Kelvin.
