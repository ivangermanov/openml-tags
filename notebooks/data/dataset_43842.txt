League of Legend High Elo Team Comp Game Length 

Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics 

I have been exploring League of Legends datasets for personal projects, but due to the limitations imposed by Riot's API, I have opted to collect data from OP.GG instead. My primary objectives are to identify the most effective team compositions and to develop a predictive model for victory or defeat based on team composition and game duration.

The most recent matches in the dataset date back to October sixteenth. This comprehensive dataset comprises ranked matches from various regions, including Korea, North America, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe servers. Each entry includes information on the winning team, total match duration, blue team composition, and red team composition.

It is worth noting that only high-elo games were incorporated into the dataset, encompassing Challenger, Grandmaster, Master, and occasionally High Diamond ranks. Furthermore, the dataset accounts for all one hundred fifty-one unique champions available in the game, with Samira being the latest addition.

The dataset features include game length, matchmaking rating, result, server, team one, team two, and timestamp.
