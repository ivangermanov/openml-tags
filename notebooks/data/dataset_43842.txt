League of Legend High Elo Team Comp Game Length Tags: Context

I was exploring League of Legends datasets to play around, but since Riot allows limited calls to their API, I collected the data from OP.GG. My few goals were to find out the best team compositions and to predict Victory or Loss given a team composition and game length. The most recent games in the dataset are from October.

The dataset consists of ranked matches from the Korea, North America, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe servers. It has information on which team won the match, the total time of the match, the blue team composition, and the red team composition. Note that only high-elo games were added, including Challenger, Grand Master, Master, and sometimes even High Diamonds. Note that there are a large number of unique champions, with the latest addition being Samira.

You may find my analysis useful, which includes quick data cleaning and analysis.

The dataset features include Game Length, Server, Team One, Team Two, and Timestamp.
