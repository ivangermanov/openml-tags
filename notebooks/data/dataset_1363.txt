QSAR-TID-13005 Dataset 

Tags: Computer Systems, Education, MTLQSAR, Study 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 13005. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and a class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50 as features. Other features include molecular fingerprints, which are essential for understanding the properties of molecules. These molecular fingerprints are represented as binary vectors, where each bit corresponds to the presence or absence of a particular molecular feature. This allows for efficient comparison and analysis of different molecules.

The dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project involves collecting and curating large amounts of data, including chemical structures, biological activities, and other relevant information. This dataset is an important contribution to the project, providing valuable insights into the properties and activities of different molecules.
