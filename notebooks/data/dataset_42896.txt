The database was created with records of behavior of the urban traffic of the city of São Paulo in Brazil, capturing the dynamics of traffic flow and incidents that occurred during a specific period. This dataset, tagged as behavior-urban-traffic, provides a comprehensive view of the traffic situation in São Paulo from Monday to Friday, with data collected every thirty minutes from seven in the morning to eight in the evening.

The dataset was used in academic research at the Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management, and it offers a unique opportunity to analyze and understand the complexities of urban traffic. The data includes information on various aspects of traffic behavior, such as the time of day, as well as incidents and events that may affect traffic flow, including immobilized buses, broken trucks, vehicle excess, accidents with victims, and running over incidents.
