Many children's products are thought to contain hazardous materials, specifically dangerous metals. It is essential to ensure that children can safely enjoy their toys without being exposed to these harmful substances.

This dataset contains numerous products tested for dangerous metals by the New York City Health Department. The importance of testing these products cannot be overstated, as it helps to identify potential health risks and ensures that manufacturers take necessary precautions to create safer products.

The dataset provides valuable insights into the metal concentrations found in various products. By analyzing this data, researchers and policymakers can work together to establish stricter safety standards and regulations, ultimately protecting the health and well-being of children.

Product information includes the type of product, product name, metal detected, concentration level, units of measurement, manufacturer details, country of origin, collection date, and deletion status.
