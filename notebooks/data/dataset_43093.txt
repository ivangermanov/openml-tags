The Miami Housing 2016 dataset contains information on single-family homes sold in Miami. This comprehensive dataset provides a wide range of features, including publicly available information, distance variables, aviation noise, and geographic coordinates.

The dataset comprises various columns, including a unique identifier for each property, sale price, land area, floor area, value of special features, distances to nearby amenities and noise sources, age of the structure, airplane noise levels, structure quality, sale month, latitude, and longitude.

A typical machine learning model would aim to predict the logarithm of the sale price based on these variables, excluding the unique parcel number. The features included in this dataset provide valuable insights into the characteristics of each property and its surroundings, allowing for a detailed analysis of the factors influencing housing prices.
