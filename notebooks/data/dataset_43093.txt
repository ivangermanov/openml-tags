The Miami Housing 2016 dataset contains information on single-family homes sold in Miami in 2016. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the housing market, including publicly available information as well as additional variables such as distance to various amenities and environmental features.

The dataset contains a unique identifier for each property, known as the Parcel Number, although about one percent of these appear multiple times. The sale price of each property is also included, as well as the land area and floor area of the property. Additionally, the value of any special features, such as swimming pools, is provided.

The dataset also includes variables related to the distance of each property to various amenities, including the nearest rail line, the ocean, bodies of water, the central business district, subcenters, and highways. These distance variables can be used as indicators of noise levels and accessibility.

Other variables in the dataset include the age of the structure, a dummy variable indicating whether the property is affected by excessive airplane noise, and a measure of the quality of the structure. The month in which the property was sold is also included, as well as the latitude and longitude of the property.

A typical model using this dataset would attempt to predict the sale price of a property as a function of all variables except the Parcel Number.
