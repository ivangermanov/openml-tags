As a community of responsible people, can we focus on predicting these disasters to save lives around? People are already going through worse, and if a sudden earthquake comes up, it becomes hell for them. The United States Geological Survey determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur in the US. The USGS provides science about the natural hazards that threaten lives and livelihoods, the water, energy, minerals, and other natural resources we rely on, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.

Established in 1879, the USGS is located in Reston, United States. The dataset contains information about earthquakes, including the time of the event, latitude and longitude of the epicenter, depth of the event, magnitude, magnitude type, number of seismic stations used to determine the location, azimuthal gap between stations, horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station, root-mean-square travel time residual, network ID, event ID, time of update, place of the event, type of seismic event, horizontal error, depth error, magnitude error, number of stations used to calculate the magnitude, status of the event, location source, and magnitude source.

The time of the event is reported in milliseconds since the epoch, and does not include leap seconds. The latitude and longitude are given in decimal degrees, with negative values for southern latitudes and western longitudes. The depth of the event is given in kilometers, and the magnitude is a decimal value. The magnitude type is a string that indicates the method or algorithm used to calculate the magnitude.

The number of seismic stations used to determine the location is an integer value, and the azimuthal gap is a decimal value that indicates the largest gap between azimuthally adjacent stations. The horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station is a decimal value, and the root-mean-square travel time residual is a decimal value that indicates the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times.

The network ID is a string that identifies the network that contributed the data, and the event ID is a unique identifier for the event. The time of update is reported in milliseconds since the epoch, and the place of the event is a string that describes the location of the event. The type of seismic event is a string that indicates whether the event is an earthquake or a quarry blast.

The horizontal error, depth error, and magnitude error are decimal values that indicate the uncertainty of the reported location, depth, and magnitude of the event. The number of stations used to calculate the magnitude is an integer value, and the status of the event is a string that indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human. The location source and magnitude source are strings that indicate the network that originally authored the reported location and magnitude of the event.
