Dataset: gina agnostic
Tags: derived, mythbusting, OpenML, study

This dataset originates from the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge, which comprised multiple datasets. The challenge aimed to compare the performance of domain specific feature engineering (prior knowledge) against algorithms trained on anonymized, preprocessed data without domain specific knowledge (agnostic).

The gina agnostic dataset focuses on handwritten digit recognition, specifically separating odd numbers from even numbers in two digit combinations. It is derived from a subset of the MNIST data set. Only the unit digit is informative for the task, making at least half of the features distracters. This presents a two class classification problem with sparse continuous input variables, where each class consists of several clusters, resulting in heterogeneous classes.

The original MNIST data was modified to create the agnostic version. Pixels that were predominantly white were removed, reducing the feature set from to a smaller number. The original resolution of gray levels was maintained. Despite the data's sparsity, it was saved as a dense matrix for better compression. Feature names represent the matrix coordinates of pixels.

To construct the dataset, the original data was divided into two parts, and digits were randomly paired to create two digit numbers. The task involves separating odd from even numbers, with the tens digit serving as a distracter. For the "prior" dataset version, the informative digit was retrieved in its original representation, resulting in a vector concatenating the lines of a pixel map.

The dataset includes samples from both training and validation sets. It contains non sparse data with numerous features and examples. The features are represented by attribute names followed by numbers, which are not easily human readable.

This dataset provides an opportunity to explore machine learning techniques on anonymized data, comparing the effectiveness of agnostic learning approaches to those utilizing prior domain knowledge in the context of handwritten digit recognition.
