This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10547, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10547. This dataset has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains information about C-C chemokine receptor type one, also known as C-C chemokine receptor type one, C-C CKR-one, CC-CKR-one, CCR one, and CCR-one. This receptor is a single protein preferred name and belongs to the species group Homo sapiens.

It is classified under membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and chemokine receptor. The description of this receptor includes its relationship and accession number.

There are multiple records available for this receptor, including its parent molecule ChEMBL ID, parent molecule name, parent molecule type, mechanism of action, max phase, first approval, USAN stem, and references.

Additionally, there is information available about expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process. The go component includes cytoplasm, plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, and membrane. The go function includes phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C activity, G protein-coupled receptor activity, chemokine receptor activity, protein binding, C-C chemokine receptor activity, C-C chemokine binding, and chemokine ligand seven binding.

The go process includes dendritic cell chemotaxis, calcium ion transport, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, exocytosis, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, cell adhesion, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

There are also cross-references available from various sources including Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro.
