QSAR-TID-10351 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen, and it has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen. Matrix Metalloproteinase Thirteen is a single protein, also known as Collagenase Three, and it belongs to the species Rattus norvegicus. It is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, and metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M ten A subfamily.

The protein target classification is one enzyme, protease, metallo protease, metallo protease MAM clan, and metallo protease M ten A subfamily. The description of the protein is Collagenase Three. The organism is Rattus norvegicus, and the species group is no protein target classification.

The protein has several GO components, including extracellular region, extracellular space, extracellular matrix, and intercellular canaliculus. It also has several GO functions, including fibronectin binding, endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, collagen binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, and calcium-dependent protein binding.

The protein is involved in several biological processes, including ossification, luteolysis, osteoblast differentiation, response to hypoxia, endochondral ossification, growth plate cartilage development, proteolysis, heart development, parturition, response to xenobiotic stimulus, response to mechanical stimulus, response to hormone, protein metabolic process, extracellular matrix disassembly, protein catabolic process, extracellular matrix organization, bone mineralization, collagen catabolic process, embryonic hindlimb morphogenesis, response to estrogen, estrous cycle, bone morphogenesis, and cellular response to fluid shear stress.

The protein has several cross-references, including canSAR-Target, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro. It is involved in several pathways, including collagen degradation, degradation of the extracellular matrix, activation of matrix metalloproteinases, and assembly of collagen fibrils and other multimeric structures.
