This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10351, is tagged with Government, MTLQSAR, and study_3. It originates from the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values of various compounds on the drug target TID: 10351. There are thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset does not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated during the fingerprint creation process. The features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

Scraped data reveals that the ID is ChEMBL four nine four four, and the type is single protein. The preferred name is Matrix Metalloproteinase thirteen, also known as Collagenase three, Matrix Metalloproteinase thirteen, Mmp thirteen, MMP-thirteen, and UMR case. The synonyms list is empty. The organism is Rattus norvegicus, belonging to the species group No. The protein target classification is one enzyme/protease/metallo protease/metallo protease MAM clan/metallo protease M ten A subfamily.

The description highlights the relationship between Accession and Collagenase three, which is classified as a single protein. The accession number is P two three zero nine seven.

There are five components associated with this protein, including extracellular region, extracellular space, extracellular matrix, intercellular canaliculus, and others. Thirteen go functions are linked to this protein, encompassing fibronectin binding, endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, calcium ion binding, collagen binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, calcium-dependent protein binding, and low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding.

Twenty-four go processes are connected to this protein, including ossification, luteolysis, osteoblast differentiation, response to hypoxia, endochondral ossification, growth plate cartilage development, proteolysis, heart development, parturition, response to xenobiotic stimulus, response to mechanical stimulus, response to hormone, protein metabolic process, extracellular matrix disassembly, protein catabolic process, extracellular matrix organization, bone mineralization, collagen catabolic process, embryonic hindlimb morphogenesis, response to estrogen, estrous cycle, bone morphogenesis, cellular response to fluid shear stress, and positive regulation of pancreatic trypsinogen secretion.

One canSAR-target is associated with this protein, bearing the accession number P two three zero nine seven. Four reactome pathways are linked to this protein, involving collagen degradation, degradation of the extracellular matrix, activation of matrix metalloproteinases, and assembly of collagen fibrils and other multimeric structures.
