Complete Historical Cryptocurrency Financial Data

Tags: Context

Recent growing interest in cryptocurrencies, specifically as a speculative investment vehicle, has sparked a global conversation over the past year. Although this data is available across various sites, there is a lack of understanding as to what is driving the exponential rise of many individual currencies. This dataset is intended to be a starting point for a detailed analysis into what is driving price action, and what can be done to predict future movement.

Inspiration

For a while now, I have been searching for a reliable source for historical price information related to cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find anything that I could use to my liking, so I built my own dataset. I've written a small script that scrapes historical price information for the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization as listed on CoinMarketCap.com. I plan to run some basic analysis on it to answer questions that I have a gut feeling about, but no quantitative evidence yet. Questions such as: What is the correlation between Bitcoin and alternative coin prices? What is the average age of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization? Which day of the week is best to buy or sell? Which coins in the top two hundred are less than six months old? Which currencies are the most volatile? What happens when we go to bed and Asia starts trading?
