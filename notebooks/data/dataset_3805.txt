QSAR-TID-11685 Tags: Demographics, MTLQSAR, study three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11685, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50 as well as numerous fingerprint features. 

Scraped Data: 

The protein target is Chymotrypsin C also known as Caldecrin, and it belongs to the serine protease family. It is an enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides or individual amino acids. 

The protein target classification is one point enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S one A subfamily. 

It is involved in various biological processes including proteolysis and intracellular calcium ion homeostasis.
