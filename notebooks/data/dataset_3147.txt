QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Dopamine D receptor, also known as D dopamine receptor or DRD. This receptor is classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein coupled receptor category, specifically a small molecule receptor and monoamine receptor within the dopamine receptor family. It is found in Chlorocebus aethiops.

The Dopamine D receptor is associated with several cellular components including the Golgi membrane, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and synapses. Its functions include G protein coupled receptor activity and dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity. The receptor is involved in various biological processes such as dopaminergic synaptic transmission, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling, adenylate cyclase inhibiting dopamine receptor signaling, regulation of cell secretion, and hyaloid vascular plexus regression.

The receptor is characterized by several protein domains and families, including GPCR Rhodopsin, Dopamine receptor, Dopamine D receptor, and GPCR Rhodopsin TM. It is also associated with the Pfam family tm.

This QSAR dataset provides valuable information for studying the activity and properties of compounds interacting with the Dopamine D receptor, which plays important roles in neurotransmission and various physiological processes.
