Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on cholesterol levels and related health factors. It has been processed to create a binary classification system, dividing subjects into two groups based on their cholesterol measurements. The binarization process involves calculating the average cholesterol level across all subjects and then categorizing individuals as either positive or negative in relation to this threshold.

The dataset includes various health-related features that may contribute to or be associated with cholesterol levels. These features encompass demographic information, cardiovascular indicators, and other relevant medical measurements. Some of the key features include age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and various other cardiac health indicators.

This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for myth-busting exercises and various studies related to cholesterol and heart health. It allows researchers to investigate potential correlations between different health factors and cholesterol levels, as well as to develop and test predictive models for cholesterol-related health outcomes.
