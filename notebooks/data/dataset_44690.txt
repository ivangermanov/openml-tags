Name: Wine Quality White Seed Two

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Wine Quality White with seed equals two

This dataset is a subsample of the original Wine Quality White dataset. It was generated using a specific source code that involves random sampling of classes, columns, and rows. The subsampling process was done to reduce the size of the original dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The subsampling process started by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeded a certain maximum, the classes were selected based on their frequency of occurrence. The indices where these selected classes were present were then used to subset the original dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled if the number of columns exceeded a certain maximum. The selected columns were chosen randomly, and the dataset was subsetted accordingly.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were sampled if the number of rows exceeded a certain maximum. The sampling was done in a stratified manner to maintain the class balance of the original dataset.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, including V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10, V11, and Class.
