Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher. 

Features: RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe, binaryClass

This dataset, known as Glass, is a binarized version of an original multi-class dataset. It has been modified to convert the target feature from multiple classes into a binary classification problem. The majority class has been relabeled as positive ('P'), while all other classes have been grouped together and labeled as negative ('N'). This conversion allows for simplified binary classification tasks and analysis.

The dataset includes various features related to glass composition and properties, such as refractive index (RI) and the presence of different chemical elements like sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), barium (Ba), and iron (Fe). The binary classification feature is represented by the "binaryClass" attribute.

This dataset is particularly useful for mythbusting and various study purposes in the field of materials science and classification algorithms. Researchers and data scientists can utilize this dataset to develop and test binary classification models for glass type prediction based on its compositional features.
