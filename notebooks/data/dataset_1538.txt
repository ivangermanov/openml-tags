This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. It has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Extended Connectivity Circular FingerPrints molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
