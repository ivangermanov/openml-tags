Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification problem. The transformation process involved calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value falls below or above this mean, respectively. Positive instances are labeled with 'P', while negative instances are labeled with 'N'.

The dataset includes features such as year and field goals, along with the newly created binary classification feature. This binarization process allows for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques to the data, potentially simplifying analysis and model development for certain research questions or applications.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The original source and date of the dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper attribution and consideration of potential limitations or biases in the data.
