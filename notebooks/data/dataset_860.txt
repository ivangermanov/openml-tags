The MFEAT-KARHUNEN dataset is a collection of data related to chemistry and life science, specifically focused on myth-busting and studying various concepts. This binarized version of the original dataset has been modified to convert the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature, where the majority class is labeled as Positive and all others are labeled as Negative.

Originally converted from its initial form, this dataset now presents a simplified classification system for easier analysis. It comprises a wide range of attributes, including various characteristics and properties related to chemistry and life science.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and students seeking to explore and understand complex concepts in chemistry and life science, particularly in the context of myth-busting and in-depth studies.
