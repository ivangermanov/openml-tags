The primary objective of this challenge is to introduce the research community to real-world datasets of significant importance to Four Paradigm. These datasets have been uniformly formatted, despite differences in their types. The data has been preprocessed into matrices, allowing participants to focus primarily on classification, although they are free to employ additional feature extraction methods, provided they adhere to the rules of the challenge.

All challenges are categorized as binary classification problems and are evaluated using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The identities of the datasets and their respective types remain concealed; however, their structures have been disclosed.

The final score for the second phase will be calculated by averaging the rankings on all testing datasets, generating a comprehensive ranking, and determining the winners based on this ranking. Time constraints have been imposed on these tasks. The CodaLab platform provides shared computational resources for all participants, featuring two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, forty gigabytes of solid-state drive storage, and an Ubuntu operating system.

To ensure fair evaluations, each code submission is executed within a predetermined time frame.
