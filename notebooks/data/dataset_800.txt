Pyrim Dataset 

Tags: Binarized, Chemistry, Life Science, Myth Busting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive 'Positive' and all others as negative 'Negative'. 

The dataset features include properties related to three molecules, including their polarity, size, flexibility, hydrogen donor and acceptor abilities, pi donor and acceptor abilities, polarisability, and sigma values.
