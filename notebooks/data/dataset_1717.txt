This dataset, named QSAR-TID-12857, is classified under the categories of Economics, Life Science, and MTLQSAR. It was part of the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12857. There are eleven rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. Some of the features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The dataset relates to the protein target Tryptase Gamma, also known as PRSS31, Serine Protease 31, TMT, and TPSG1. This transmembrane tryptase is a single protein and belongs to the species group Homo sapiens. Its classification falls under enzyme, protease, serine protease, and serine protease PA clan.

Tryptase Gamma is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, and has functions related to serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.

Keywords: QSAR, Tryptase Gamma, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, serine protease, proteolysis.
