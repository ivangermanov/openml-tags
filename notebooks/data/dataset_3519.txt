QSAR-TID-12809 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12809, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features, and others.
