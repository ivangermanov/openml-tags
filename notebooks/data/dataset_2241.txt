QSAR-TID-11286 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11286. It has multiple rows and multiple features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The data contains molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features. These features do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
