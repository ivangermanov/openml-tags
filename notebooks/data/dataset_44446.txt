Name: Cover Type Seed Three with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type with seed equals three, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset. It takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the maximum number of columns randomly.

If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data accordingly. It concatenates the data and target, splits the data into a subset of the desired size, and then separates the data and target again.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, target, categorical mask, and columns.
