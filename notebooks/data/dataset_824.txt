The Anal Cat Data Draft dataset has been modified to create a binarized version of the original dataset. This conversion involved transforming the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature, where the majority class has been relabeled as Positive and all other classes have been relabeled as Negative.

This dataset is tagged under Chemistry, Life Science, MythBusting, Study, and other related categories.

Features of this dataset include the Actual Date, Monthly information, and Binary Class labels.
