Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This process transforms the continuous data into a binary classification problem, which can be useful for certain types of analysis and machine learning tasks.

The dataset provides a binarized representation of an original regression problem, allowing for binary classification approaches to be applied. This transformation can be particularly useful in scenarios where the goal is to categorize instances into two distinct groups based on their relationship to the mean value of the target feature. Such binarization techniques are often employed in data preprocessing to simplify complex numerical data for certain types of analysis or to test the effectiveness of binary classification algorithms on originally continuous data.
