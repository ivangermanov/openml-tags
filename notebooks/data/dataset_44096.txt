The German Credit dataset classifies individuals described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. This dataset comes with a cost matrix:

Good         Bad (predicted)
Good          0            1 (actual)
Bad           5            0

It is worse to classify a customer as good when they are bad, than it is to classify a customer as bad when they are good.
