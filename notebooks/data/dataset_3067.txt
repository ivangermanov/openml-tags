QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on LIM domain kinase, a single protein target. LIM domain kinase is also known as LIMK or LIMK. It is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the TKL protein kinase LISK family, specifically the TKL protein kinase LIMK subfamily within the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase classification.

LIM domain kinase is primarily located in the nucleus, cytoplasm, cis Golgi network, centrosome, microtubule organizing center, spindle, cytoskeleton, intracellular organelles, and perinuclear region of cytoplasm. Its functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, metal ion binding, and protein serine kinase activity.

The protein is involved in various biological processes such as positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, protein phosphorylation, spermatogenesis, actin cytoskeleton organization, astral microtubule organization, establishment of vesicle localization, head development, cornea development in camera type eye, positive regulation of protein localization to nucleus, and negative regulation of cilium assembly.

Additional information about LIM domain kinase can be found in various databases including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. The protein is also referenced in resources such as ExpressionAtlas, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, and Wikipedia.
