Historical Financials Data for Stocks

Context:
Getting access to high-quality historical stock market data can be very expensive and complicated. Parsing SEC 10-Q filings directly from the SEC EDGAR is difficult due to the varying structures of filings. Moreover, SEC filing data from providers such as Quandl charge hefty yearly fees to get access to them. 

Content:
The quarterly financials are provided in a single CSV file, Quarterly Financials. It is worth noting that approximately half of the data is missing, either because the field was not detected by the XBRL parsing system or the field was not addressed in the SEC filing.

Acknowledgements:
All the data is scraped from the SEC from the XBRL files.

Features:
The dataset includes a range of financial metrics, including assets, liabilities, stockholder equity, earnings per share, net income, profit and loss, cost of goods sold, filing date, costs and expenses, cash, notes payable, preferred stock value, depreciation, operating expenses, revenues, land, accounts receivable, deferred revenue, gross profit, shares issued, accrued income taxes, shares outstanding, borrowed funds, inventory, commercial paper, dividends, common stock, cost of services, debt, accrued insurance, officers' compensation, intangible assets, salaries and wages, interest and debt expense, convertible debt, asset management costs, accounts receivable, direct operating costs, operating cycle, and stock.
