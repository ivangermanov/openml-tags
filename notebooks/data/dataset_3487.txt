The Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is a transmembrane receptor that belongs to the protein kinase superfamily and is involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways.

The receptor is composed of several domains, including the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular domain. The extracellular domain is responsible for binding to insulin-like growth factor 1, while the intracellular domain contains the tyrosine kinase activity that is essential for signal transduction.

The Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is also implicated in several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting the Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor.
