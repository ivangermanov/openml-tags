Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample 6.

This Bayesian network repository reference is available at bnlearn, a comprehensive repository for Bayesian networks.

The Hepar2 network consists of seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, with a total of one thousand four hundred fifty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, while the average degree is approximately three point five one. The maximum in-degree is six.

This network is particularly useful for modeling complex relationships between various medical conditions and symptoms. It features a range of variables related to liver disorders, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase levels, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint problems, platelet count, very high alpha-macroglobulin levels, spider angiomas, spleen problems, age, jaundice, hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, chronic hepatitis, itching, steatosis, sex, history of injections, hepatitis B surface antigen, cirrhosis, palmar erythema, pain, hepatitis C virus antibody, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase levels, rheumatic hepatitis, gallstones, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, primary biliary cirrhosis, alanine transaminase levels, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, aspartate transaminase levels, hepatitis B e antigen, skin problems, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, hepatitis B core antibody, right upper quadrant pressure, history of alcohol consumption, lupoid hepatitis, antimitochondrial antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites, hospitalization, obesity, diabetes, history of choledocholithotomy, liver density, blood transfusion, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, liver edge, edema, fatty liver, history of alcoholism, surgical intervention.
