Hailfinder Dataset

Tags: Graphical models, MaRDI, New Tag, Random Tag, TA3

The Hailfinder dataset is a Bayesian network designed to forecast severe summer hail in northeastern Colorado. This dataset contains fifty-six variables that are used to predict the likelihood of hail.

The variables in the dataset include factors such as vertical motion, moisture, cloud cover, instability, wind patterns, and boundaries. These factors are used to forecast the probability of hail in different regions, including the mountains and plains.

The dataset includes variables such as the subjective judgment of vertical motion, quasigeostrophic vertical motion, combined vertical motion, area of meso-alpha, satellite contribution to moisture, reading at the forecast center for moisture, combined moisture, area of moisture and dry air, visible cloud cover, infrared cloud cover, combined cloud cover, cloud shading, instability in the mountains, wind hodograph, outflow from mountains, morning boundaries, boundaries, cloud shading convection, composite plains forecast, capping change, low-level moisture advection, instability change, mountain forecast, date, scenario, scenario relevant to AM convective inhibition, morning convective inhibition, AM convective inhibition in scenario, capping within scenario, scenario relevant to AM instability, LI from twelve Z DEN sounding, AM dewpoint calculations plains, AM instability within scenario, instability scaling within scenario, scenario relevant to regions two/three/four, latest convective inhibition, LLIW severe weather index, current propensity to convection, scenario relevant to plains forecast, plains forecast, regions two/three/four forecast, region five forecast, dewpoints, low-level lapse rate, mean relative humidity, mid-level lapse rate, movement of features, relative humidity ratio, surface wind shifts and discontinuities, synoptic forcing, temperature discontinuities, wind aloft, wind fields mountains, and wind fields plains.
