The consumer credit department of a bank wants to automate the decision-making process for approval of home equity lines of credit. To do this, they will follow the recommendations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to create an empirically derived and statistically sound credit scoring model. The model will be based on data collected from recent applicants who were granted credit through the current process of loan underwriting. This model will be built from predictive modeling tools, but the created model must be sufficiently interpretable to provide a reason for any adverse actions or rejections.

The Home Equity dataset, referred to as HMEQ, contains baseline and loan performance information for recent home equity loans. The target variable, Bad, is a binary indicator of whether an applicant eventually defaulted or was seriously delinquent. This adverse outcome occurred in certain cases. For each applicant, twelve input variables were recorded, including Loan Amount, Mortgage Due, Property Value, Reason for Loan, Job Type, Years on Job, Number of Derogatory Reports, Number of Delinquencies, Credit Account Age, Number of Inquiries, Credit Account Number, and Debt-to-Income Ratio.
