QSAR-TID-10657 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10657. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10657. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Adenosine A1 receptor, which is a single protein target.

The Adenosine A1 receptor is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and response to stimulus.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on QSAR modeling and drug discovery for the Adenosine A1 receptor.
