This dataset, named QSAR-TID-10657, belongs to the categories of Economics and Life Science, and is part of the MTLQSAR and MetaQSAR projects. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10657. 

The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. These features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The preferred name for this target is Adenosine A One Receptor. It also has synonyms such as Adenosine Receptor A One and ADORA One. 

It belongs to the species Gallus gallus, and its protein target classification is one point Membrane Receptor, Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor, Small Molecule Receptor, Family A GPCR, Nucleotide-Like Receptor, Family A GPCR, Adenosine Receptor.

It has component relationships with plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, synapse, and cellular anatomical entity. 

Its function includes G protein-coupled adenosine receptor activity and G protein-coupled receptor activity.

Its process includes G protein-coupled adenosine receptor signaling pathway, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and response to stimulus.
