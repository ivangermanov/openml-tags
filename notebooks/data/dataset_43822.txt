Perth House Prices
Tags: Acknowledgements

This dataset was scraped from the website http://house.speakingsame.com/ and includes data from various Perth suburbs, resulting in a comprehensive collection of information. 

I believe the columns chosen to represent this dataset are the most crucial in predicting house prices. Some preliminary analysis I conducted showed a significant correlation between each of these columns and the response variable, namely the price of the house. 

Data obtained from other sources includes Longitude and Latitude data, which was obtained from data.gov.au. School ranking data was obtained from Better Education. The nearest schools to each address selected in this dataset are schools that are defined to be ATAR-applicable. In the Australian secondary school education system, ATAR is a scoring system used to assess a student's cumulative academic results and is used for entry into Australian universities. As such, schools that do not have an ATAR program, such as primary schools, vocational schools, special needs schools, etc., are not considered in determining the nearest school. It is also worth noting that under the Nearest School Rank column, there are some missing rows as some schools are unranked according to this criteria by Better Education.
