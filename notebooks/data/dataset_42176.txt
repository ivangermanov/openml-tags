Parkinson Speech UCI Dataset

The dataset used in this study was gathered from patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The data collection process involved recording the sustained phonation of the vowel "a" from each subject with three repetitions, using a microphone set to 44.1 kHz.

The dataset consists of various speech signal processing algorithms, including Time Frequency Features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Wavelet Transform-based Features, Vocal Fold Features, and TWQT features, which were applied to the speech recordings to extract clinically useful information for Parkinson's disease assessment.

The attributes in the dataset include demographic information, such as gender, as well as various speech signal processing features, including measures of jitter, shimmer, harmonicity, intensity, and frequency.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working on the diagnosis and assessment of Parkinson's disease using speech signal processing techniques.
