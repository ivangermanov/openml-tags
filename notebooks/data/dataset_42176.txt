Parkinson Speech UCI Dataset

Tags: Demographics, Economics

Data Set Information:
The data used in this study were gathered from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The patient group consisted of one hundred and eighty-eight individuals, including one hundred and seven men and eighty-one women, with ages ranging across decades. In contrast, the control group comprised sixty-four healthy individuals, consisting of twenty-three men and forty-one women, also spanning various age ranges. During the data collection process, the microphone was set to capture high-quality audio signals, and following the physician's examination, the sustained phonation of the vowel "a" was recorded from each subject with three repetitions.

Attribute Information:
Various speech signal processing algorithms were applied to the speech recordings of Parkinson's disease patients to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment. These algorithms included time-frequency features, mel frequency cepstral coefficients, wavelet transform-based features, vocal fold features, and TWQT features.
