Inferring Relevance from Eye Movements: Feature Extraction

The Eye Movements dataset is a straightforward classification task that provides pre-computed feature vectors for each word in the eye movement trajectory, along with class labels. The dataset consists of several assignments, each comprising a question followed by ten sentences, which are titles of news articles. One of the sentences is the correct answer to the question, five sentences are irrelevant to the question, and four sentences are relevant to the question but do not answer it.

The dataset features include the line number, assignment number, previous fixation duration, first fixation duration, first pass fixation duration, next fixation duration, first saccade length, last saccade length, previous fixation position, landing position, leaving position, total fixation duration, mean fixation duration, regression length, regression duration, pupil diameter maximum, pupil diameter lag, time protection, title number, word number, probability of first fixation, probability of second fixation, and next word regression.

The dataset is available at the provided URL, and it is a preprocessed dataset, making it ready for analysis.
