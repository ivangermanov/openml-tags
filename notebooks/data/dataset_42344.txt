sf-police-incidents Tags: Incident reports from the San Francisco Police Department between January and May, provided by the City and County of San Francisco. The dataset was downloaded from the official website. For a description of all variables, check out the homepage of the data provider. The original data was published under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License. As the target, the binary variable Violent Crime was created. A Violent Crime was defined as Category belonging to Assault, Robbery, Sex Offenses Forcible, or Kidnapping, or Descript belonging to Grand Theft Purse Snatch or Attempted Grand Theft Purse Snatch. Additional date and time features, including Hour, Day of the Week, Month, and Year, were created. The original variables, including Category, Descript, Date, Time, Resolution, Location, and Police Department Identification, were removed from the dataset. One record, which contained the only missing value in the variable Police District, was removed from the dataset. Using this dataset for machine learning was inspired by a blog post about modeling tricks and impact coding of categorical variables with many levels. Note that incidents consist of multiple rows in the dataset when the crime belongs to more than one Category, which is indicated by the Identification variable Incident Number, ignored by default. For this version, the majority class was downsampled to achieve a balanced classification task. Unused factor levels were dropped. The numeric features, including coordinates, were removed to increase the importance of the high cardinal factorial features.
