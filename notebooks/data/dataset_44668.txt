Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed with seed equal to zero, arguments n rows max equal to two thousand, n columns max equal to one hundred, n classes max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, n rows max, n columns max, n classes max, and stratified as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses the numpy random default random generator to generate random numbers. It then selects a subset of the data based on the input arguments. If the number of classes is greater than n classes max, it selects a subset of classes using the value counts of the target variable and the random generator. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than n columns max, it selects a subset of columns using the random generator. If the number of rows is greater than n rows max, it uses the train test split function from scikit learn to split the data into a subset of the desired size, stratifying accordingly. Finally, it returns a dataset with the subset of data, categorical mask, and columns.
