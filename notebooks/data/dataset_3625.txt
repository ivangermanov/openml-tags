QSAR-TID-11000 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11000. The dataset has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the chemical structure of compounds.

The features in the dataset are primarily FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and provide a compact and efficient way to represent the chemical structure of compounds.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the drug target TID: 11000. The activity values in the dataset can be used to train machine learning models to predict the activity of new compounds, and the molecular fingerprints can be used to identify structural features that are associated with activity.
