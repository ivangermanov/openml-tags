Online Peer-to-Peer Lending Dataset 
Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This dataset is comprised of historical loans from both Prosper and Lending Club, spanning from the year two thousand thirteen to two thousand eighteen. At present, only summaries of the loans are available, including terms, origination dates, loan amounts, statuses, and other relevant information. However, detailed lender data will be added soon. The columns have been matched as accurately as possible, although some columns are estimates.

The dataset contains a wealth of information about each loan, including the loan number, amount borrowed, loan term, borrower rate, monthly installment, credit grade, origination date, listing title, outstanding principal balance, total principal paid, total interest paid, late fees paid, debt sale proceeds received, last payment date, next payment due date, days past due, and loan status description. Additionally, the source of the data is also indicated.
