Edge Embedding represents the Embedding of Molecules Bonds in the HIV Inhibitors Dataset. This dataset features a comprehensive set of molecular properties, including Edge Zero, Edge One, Edge Two, and so on, up to Edge Twenty-Nine. These features are essential in understanding the molecular structure and behavior of HIV inhibitors.
