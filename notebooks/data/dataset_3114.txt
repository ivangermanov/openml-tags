QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Leukotriene A hydrolase, also known as Leukotriene A hydrolase, Lta h, LTA hydrolase, and Tripeptide aminopeptidase LTAH. This protein is found in Mus musculus and belongs to the Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAE clan/Metallo protease M family classification.

Gene Ontology annotations for this protein include various cellular components such as nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and cytosol. Its molecular functions encompass aminopeptidase activity, epoxide hydrolase activity, leukotriene A hydrolase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, tripeptide aminopeptidase activity, metal ion binding, and metalloaminopeptidase activity.

Biological processes involving this protein include proteolysis, leukotriene metabolic process, response to zinc ion, leukotriene biosynthetic process, protein metabolic process, peptide catabolic process, response to peptide hormone, and type I pneumocyte differentiation.

The protein is involved in several Reactome pathways, including synthesis of Leukotrienes and Eoxins, neutrophil degranulation, biosynthesis of D series resolvins, protectins, E series (S) resolvins, aspirin triggered D series resolvins, and E series (R) resolvins.

Various database entries and classifications are associated with this protein, including UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam entries. These classifications provide further information on the protein's structure, function, and evolutionary relationships.
