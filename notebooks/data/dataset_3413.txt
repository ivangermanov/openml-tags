This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target DNA dependent protein kinase, and it has multiple rows and features.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, and many other features that are not human readable.

Dataset name is QSAR-TID-10056 and it is part of the MetaQSAR project.

Tags include economics, life science, MTLQSAR, and study three.

This dataset should be cited as part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

DNA dependent protein kinase is an enzyme that plays a key role in the repair of DNA double strand breaks through the non-homologous end joining pathway.

It is a key component of the non-homologous end joining machinery and is essential for the repair of DNA double strand breaks.

The protein is composed of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit, and its activity is tightly regulated through various post-translational modifications.

Deregulation of DNA dependent protein kinase has been implicated in various diseases including cancer and immunodeficiency disorders.
