QSAR-TID-10056 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10056. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 690 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The target is DNA-dependent protein kinase, also known as DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, DNA-PK catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, DNPK1, HYRC. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/atypical protein kinase group/atypical protein kinase PIKK family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015.

The target is involved in various biological processes, including DNA repair, DNA recombination, and response to DNA damage. It is also involved in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation.

The target has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and has been the subject of several studies on its role in DNA damage response and repair.

Keywords: DNA-dependent protein kinase, QSAR, molecular fingerprints, DNA repair, protein phosphorylation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, cancer.
