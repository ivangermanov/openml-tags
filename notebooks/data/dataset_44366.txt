California Seed Four Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset California with seed equal to four, arguments number of rows maximum equal to two thousand, arguments number of columns maximum equal to one hundred, arguments number of classes maximum equal to ten, and arguments no stratify equal to false.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. 

First, it samples the classes uniformly, selecting the indices where one of the selected classes is present. Then, it samples the columns uniformly if required. 

If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it stratifies the data accordingly, using the target name, and splits the data into a subset of the desired size. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string for open machine learning, and returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and columns.
