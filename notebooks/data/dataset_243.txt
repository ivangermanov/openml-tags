This dataset, named ipums la ninety-eight small, is tagged with demographics, derived, history, study one, and study forty-one. It contains unweighted PUMS census data from the Los Angeles and Long Beach areas for the years nineteen seventy, nineteen eighty, and nineteen ninety. The coding schemes have been standardized to be consistent across years.

The original source for this dataset is the IPUMS project, a large collection of federal census data with standardized coding schemes to make comparisons across time easy. The data is an unweighted one in one hundred sample of responses from the Los Angeles â€“ Long Beach area for the specified years. The household and individual records were flattened into a single table, and all variables available for all three years were included. When there was more than one version of a variable, such as for race, the most general version was used. For occupation and industry, the nineteen fifty basis was used.

Note that PUMS data is based on cluster samples, meaning samples are made up of households or dwellings from which there may be multiple individuals. Individuals from the same household are no longer independent. The effect of this issue, along with the effects of stratification, on standard errors is discussed further.

The variable school type appears to have different coding values across the years nineteen seventy, nineteen eighty, and nineteen ninety. There are two versions of this dataset. The small dataset contains a one in one thousand sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area, formed by sampling from the large dataset. The large dataset contains a one in one hundred sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area.

The dataset must be cited appropriately, including the IPUMS project as the source. Users are granted a limited license to use and distribute the dataset, subject to certain conditions. No fee may be charged for use or distribution, and publications and research reports based on the dataset must cite it appropriately.
