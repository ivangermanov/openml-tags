QSAR-TID-9 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 9. This dataset has 5013 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it. The dataset is related to the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is a transmembrane receptor that binds to epidermal growth factor, leading to the activation of various downstream signaling pathways. It is involved in various physiological processes, including embryonic development, tissue repair, and immune response.

The receptor has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where it is often overexpressed or mutated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Inhibitors of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor have been developed as cancer therapeutics, and they have shown promising results in clinical trials.

The dataset can be used to develop predictive models of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor activity, which can aid in the discovery of new inhibitors and the optimization of existing ones.
