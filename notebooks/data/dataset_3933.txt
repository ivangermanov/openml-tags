This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: nine, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
