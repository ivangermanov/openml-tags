The BTS-Lyrics dataset was collated as a casual project using data from Genius and Big Hit. Currently, it contains a collection of albums, with each album having its unique characteristics.

The dataset has several columns that provide information about each track. The first column is the ID, which is a sequential numerical identifier that uniquely identifies each track. The Album Title column contains the title of the album, while the English Album Title column contains the title of the album without non-English characters.

The Album Release Date column contains the date the album was released in ISO format (Year-Month-Day). The Album Sequence column indicates the sequence of the track in the album. The Track Title column contains the title of the track, while the Korean Track Title column contains the title of the track with Korean characters. The English Track Title column contains the title of the track without non-English characters.

The Lyrics column contains the English translated lyrics of the track, sourced from Genius. Note that this column will be empty for instrumental tracks. The Hidden Track column indicates whether the track is a hidden track, while the Remix column indicates whether the track is a remix. The Featured column indicates who is featured in the track.

The Performed By column indicates who performed the track, with multiple individuals separated by semicolons. Note that featured artists will not be reflected in this column. The Repackaged column indicates if the track was already released in an earlier album. The Language column indicates the language of the track, with options including Korean, English, and Not Applicable (for instrumentals).
