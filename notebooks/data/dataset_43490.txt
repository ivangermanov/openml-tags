The BTS-Lyrics dataset is a collection of data gathered as a casual project using information from Genius and Big Hit. This dataset currently contains a multitude of albums, each with its unique characteristics.

The columns in the dataset include a sequential numerical identifier to uniquely identify each track, the title of the album, the title of the album without non-English characters, the release date of the album in ISO format, and the sequence of the track within the album.

Additionally, the dataset includes the title of the track, the title of the track with Korean characters, the title of the track without non-English characters, and the English-translated lyrics of the track obtained from Genius, which will be empty for instrumental tracks.

Other columns indicate whether the track is a hidden track, a remix, or features other artists, as well as who performed the track, with multiple individuals separated by semicolons. The dataset also notes whether the track was previously released in an earlier album and the language of the track, categorized as Korean, English, or Not Applicable for instrumentals.

Acknowledgments are given for the banner and profile image inspiration.

Future improvements planned for the dataset include the addition of Japanese albums.

Features of the dataset include the track identifier, album title, English album title, album release date, album sequence, track title, Korean track title, English track title, lyrics, hidden track indicator, remix indicator, featured artist indicator, performed-by indicator, repackaged indicator, and language.
