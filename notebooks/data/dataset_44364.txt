The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses random number generation to select a specified number of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. The function first selects a specified number of classes from the dataset, and then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. It then selects a specified number of columns from the dataset, and finally selects a specified number of rows from the dataset. The function uses stratified sampling to ensure that the selected rows are representative of the original dataset.

The dataset California is a large dataset with many features, including Median Income, House Age, Average Rooms, Average Bedrooms, Population, Average Occupation, Latitude, Longitude, and Price. The subsample function is used to reduce the size of this dataset while still maintaining its representative characteristics.
