Subsampling of the dataset KC One with seed equals one arguments number rows max equals two thousand arguments number columns max equals one hundred arguments number classes max equals ten arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

def subsample(self, seed, number rows maximum, number columns maximum, number classes maximum, stratified) -> Dataset:
random number generator equals numpy dot random dot default random generator opened in parenthesis seed closed parenthesis
x equals self x
y equals self y

Uniformly sample classes equals y dot unique
if length of classes is greater than number classes maximum:
value counts equals y dot value counts
selected classes equals random number generator dot choice opened in parenthesis classes comma size equals number classes maximum comma replace equals false comma probability equals value counts divided by sum of value counts closed parenthesis
Select the indices where one of these classes is present index equals y dot index opened in parenthesis y dot is in opened in parenthesis classes closed parenthesis closed parenthesis
x equals x dot iloc opened in parenthesis index closed parenthesis
y equals y dot iloc opened in parenthesis index closed parenthesis

Uniformly sample columns if required
if length of x dot columns is greater than number columns maximum:
column indexes equals random number generator dot choice opened in parenthesis list opened in parenthesis range opened in parenthesis length of x dot columns closed parenthesis closed parenthesis comma size equals number columns maximum comma replace equals false closed parenthesis
sorted column indexes equals sorted opened in parenthesis column indexes closed parenthesis
selected columns equals list opened in parenthesis x dot columns opened in parenthesis sorted column indexes closed parenthesis closed parenthesis
x equals x opened in parenthesis selected columns closed parenthesis
else:
sorted column indexes equals list opened in parenthesis range opened in parenthesis length of x dot columns closed parenthesis closed parenthesis

if length of x is greater than number rows maximum:
Stratify accordingly
target name equals y dot name
data equals pandas dot concat opened in parenthesis x comma y comma axis equals quote columns closed quote closed parenthesis

y equals subset opened in parenthesis target name closed parenthesis

We need to convert categorical columns to string for OpenML
categorical mask equals opened in parenthesis self dot categorical mask opened in parenthesis i for i in sorted column indexes closed parenthesis
columns equals list opened in parenthesis x dot columns closed parenthesis
return Dataset opened in parenthesis 
dataset equals self dot dataset 
x equals x 
y equals y 
categorical mask equals categorical mask 
columns equals columns 
closed parenthesis
