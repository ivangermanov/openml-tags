The Pigs Bayesian Network is a comprehensive repository of data that showcases the capabilities of Bayesian networks in modeling complex systems. This network comprises four hundred forty-one nodes and five hundred ninety-two arcs, which are used to represent probabilistic relationships between variables. With a staggering five thousand six hundred eighteen parameters, this network is capable of capturing intricate patterns and dependencies within the data.

One notable feature of the Pigs Bayesian Network is its average Markov blanket size, which stands at three point sixty-six, indicating a moderate level of complexity in the relationships between variables. Furthermore, the average degree of the nodes is two point sixty-eight, suggesting a relatively sparse network structure.

The maximum in-degree of the nodes is two, implying that each node has a limited number of parent nodes influencing its behavior. This feature contributes to the overall efficiency of the network in terms of computational resources required for inference and learning.

Some of the key characteristics of the Pigs Bayesian Network include its large scale, complex structure, and high dimensionality. These features make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking and evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms and Bayesian network learning methods.
