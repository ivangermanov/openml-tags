KDD Cup Ninety Nine Seed Four Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the KDD Cup Ninety Nine dataset with a seed of four. It has been generated using a specific source code written in Python.

The subsample function takes several arguments, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratified sampling. In this case, the seed value is four, the maximum number of rows is two thousand, the maximum number of columns is one hundred, and the maximum number of classes is ten.

The function first uniformly samples the classes, selecting a specified number of unique classes from the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the data.

Next, the function uniformly samples the columns, selecting a specified number of columns from the dataset. Finally, it stratifies the data according to the target variable and subsets the data to the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset contains a selection of features, including duration, protocol type, service, flag, and others related to network traffic and system access. The dataset is tagged as relating to Agriculture and Earth Science.
