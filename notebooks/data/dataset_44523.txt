Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses random number generation to select a subset of the data. The function first selects a subset of classes, then selects a subset of columns, and finally selects a subset of rows. The selection of classes and rows is done in a stratified manner to ensure that the subsample is representative of the original dataset.

The function takes in several arguments, including the seed for the random number generator, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, and the maximum number of classes. It also takes in a boolean argument to determine whether to stratify the sampling.

The function returns a new dataset that contains the subsampled data. The dataset includes the subsampled features, the target variable, and a mask to indicate which columns are categorical.
