Machine Learning Dataset: Arcene Seed One 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Arcene dataset, featuring two thousand rows and one hundred columns. The sampling process ensured that the dataset retained ten distinct classes, which were chosen randomly from the original set of classes.

The sampling methodology employed a combination of uniform sampling and stratification techniques. Firstly, the algorithm uniformly sampled classes from the original dataset, selecting ten classes based on their frequency distribution. It then proceeded to select the corresponding indices where these classes were present.

Next, the algorithm performed uniform column sampling, choosing one hundred columns from the original set of columns. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its underlying structure.

Finally, the dataset was stratified according to the target variable, ensuring that the resulting subsampled dataset retained a balanced representation of all ten classes.

Features include various variables such as molecular descriptors, spectral intensities, and other attributes relevant to the manufacturing domain.
