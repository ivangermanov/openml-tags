Condominium Comparable Rental Income in NYC
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

The Department of Finance is required by New York State law to value condominiums or cooperatives as if they were residential rental apartment buildings. To accomplish this, the Department of Finance uses income information from rental properties similar in physical features and location to the condominiums or cooperatives. By applying this income data to the condominium or cooperative, the Department of Finance determines its value in the same way it values rental apartment buildings.

This report includes information at a condominium suffix level, which represents a subdivision of the condominium since the Department of Finance values condominiums at a suffix level. It is not uncommon for a condominium to have more than one suffix.

The dataset contains reports from multiple years, providing a comprehensive overview of the valuation process.

Each record includes essential information about the property, including:

* Borough-Block-Lot Location: The unique identifier of the property, consisting of the borough, block, and lot.
* Address: The street address of the property.
* Neighborhood: The designated neighborhood where the property is located, as determined by the Department of Finance.
* Building Classification: A two-character code describing the property's use, along with a detailed description of the building class.
* Total Units: The total number of units within the building.
* Year Built: The year the building was constructed.
* Gross Square Footage: The total square footage of the building.
* Estimated Gross Income: An estimate of the annual gross income generated by the property.
* Estimated Expense: An estimate of the annual operating expenses incurred by the property.
* Net Operating Income: The estimated gross income minus the estimated expense.
* Full Market Value: The current total market value of the land and building.
