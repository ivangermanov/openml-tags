The ELE Two dataset, tagged as Electrical Maintenance, consists of four input variables and a comprehensive dataset comprising a representative number of well-distributed examples. As a result, learning methods are expected to obtain a considerable number of rules, which implies a larger search space characterized by high complexity.

The dataset features five attributes:

One: X One, a real-valued attribute ranging from zero point five to eleven point zero.
Two: X Two, a real-valued attribute ranging from zero point one five to eight point five five.
Three: X Three, a real-valued attribute ranging from one point six four to one forty-two point five.
Four: X Four, a real-valued attribute ranging from one point zero to one sixty-five point zero.
Five: Y, a real-valued attribute ranging from sixty-four point four seven zero zero one to eight thousand five hundred forty-six point zero three zero two seven three.
