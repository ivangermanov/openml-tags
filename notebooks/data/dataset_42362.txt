ELE Two Tags: Electrical Maintenance Data Set

This problem consists of four input variables, and the available data set comprises a representative number of well-distributed examples. In this case, the learning methods are expected to obtain a considerable number of rules. Therefore, this problem involves a larger search space, which is characterized by high complexity.

The attributes included in this data set are:

One: X One - a real value ranging from point five to eleven point zero.
Two: X Two - a real value ranging from point one five to eight point five five.
Three: X Three - a real value ranging from one point six four to one forty-two point five.
Four: X Four - a real value ranging from one point zero to one sixty-five point zero.
Five: Y - a real value ranging from sixty-four point four seven zero zero one to eight thousand five hundred forty-six point zero three zero two seven three.
