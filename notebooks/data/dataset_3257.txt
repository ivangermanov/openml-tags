QSAR-TID-236 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: two thirty-six, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It is a comprehensive collection of QSAR data, providing valuable insights into the activity of compounds on specific drug targets. The dataset is particularly useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The features of the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. This allows for the comparison and analysis of different molecules and their properties. The dataset also includes IDs and class features, which provide additional information about the molecules and their activity.

The MetaQSAR project is a collaborative effort to collect and curate QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and standardized dataset for QSAR modeling and analysis.
