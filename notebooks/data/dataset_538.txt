The USNEWS dataset for the ASA Statistical Graphics Section's Data Analysis Exposition contains information on over American colleges and universities. The data may be obtained in either of two formats. USNEWS.DATA contains the raw data in comma delimited fields with a single data line for each school. The order of variables is the same as given below for the fixed column version, although the spacing varies for each school. USNEWS.DATA has the data arranged in fixed columns, with three data lines for each school and a maximum line length of characters.

This dataset is taken from the U.S. News & World Report's Guide to America's Best Colleges. This dataset is protected by copyright, is reproduced with permission of the copyright holder(s), and may not be downloaded or otherwise copied, except solely for the purpose of analysis in connection with the American Statistical Association's Data Analysis Exposition. The data are reproduced with the permission of the publisher. Most of the data are for the school year. You may wish to consult a copy of the U.S. News source for more detailed descriptions of the variables.

The dataset includes information such as the Federal ID number, college name, state, public/private indicator, average SAT and ACT scores, application and enrollment statistics, tuition costs, faculty information, and graduation rates. Missing values are denoted with an asterisk.

To obtain the dataset from Statlib, users can send specific messages to the provided email address. The purpose of the Data Analysis Exposition is to encourage statisticians to demonstrate techniques, especially graphical, for analyzing data and displaying the results of an analysis. Individuals and groups will work with the same set of data and present their analyses at a special session as part of the annual Joint Statistical Meetings.

The datasets are drawn from two sources: U.S. News & World Report's Guide to America's Best Colleges and the AAUP (American Association of University Professors) Salary Survey. The U.S. News data contains information on various college-related metrics, while the AAUP data includes average salary, overall compensation, and number of faculty broken down by professor ranks.

Participants in the Data Analysis Exposition are encouraged to explore various aspects of the data, such as modeling tuition, clustering colleges into comparison groups, displaying faculty salary structures, or finding ways to rank schools. The main objective is to find innovative ways to display the interesting features of the data.
