The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility. The function first selects a subset of classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes does not exceed the maximum number of classes specified. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the original dataset.

If the number of columns in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of columns specified, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset. It does this by generating a list of column indices, sorting them, and then selecting the top columns based on the maximum number of columns specified.

If the number of rows in the dataset exceeds the maximum number of rows specified, the function uses the train test split function from scikit learn to split the dataset into a subset of the specified size. It does this in a stratified manner to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset that includes the subsampled data, the categorical mask, and the column names.
