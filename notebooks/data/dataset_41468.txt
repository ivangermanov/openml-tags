The Image benchmark dataset consists of two thousand natural scene images. This dataset was made publicly available as a processed image dataset, with each image being associated with one hundred thirty-five features. Each observation can be associated with different label sets, where all possible labels are Desert, Mountains, Sea, Sunset, and Trees. About a quarter of the images belong to more than one class, although images belonging to three classes or more are very rare.

The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of features, including various characteristics that describe the images. These features are essential in understanding the complexities of the images and their relationships with the labels.

The Image dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on multi-label classification tasks, as it provides a challenging and realistic scenario for evaluating the performance of their models.
