This image benchmark dataset consists of two thousand natural scene images. A total of one hundred thirty-five features were extracted for each image, making it publicly available as a processed image dataset. Each observation can be associated with different label sets, where all possible labels include desert, mountains, sea, sunset, and trees. Approximately twenty-two percent of the images belong to more than one class; however, images belonging to three classes or more are extremely rare.
