This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies include research on carbolenes, melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, QSAR analysis, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity relationships, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloalkanes, protein engineering, stability of aromatic amides, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The datasets cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, including molecular descriptors, physicochemical properties, toxicity, biodegradability, enzyme activity, protein stability, and drug efficacy. Various computational and statistical methods were employed in these studies, such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), and multivariate pattern recognition.

These datasets provide valuable resources for researchers in the fields of medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and drug discovery. They can be used to develop and validate predictive models for various molecular properties and biological activities.
