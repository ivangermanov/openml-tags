QSAR-TID-10120 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10120, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset includes multiple molecular fingerprints such as FCFP6 1024 0, FCFP6 1024 1, FCFP6 1024 2, and so on. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015. 

The dataset is related to the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Eleven, also known as MAPK11. It is a single protein preferred name, with synonyms including MAP kinase p38 beta, MAPK 11, MAP kinase 11, and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 11. 

It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens, and its protein target classification is enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase MAPK family/CMGC protein kinase p38 subfamily. 

The dataset includes information about the relationship between the molecule and the target, including mechanisms of action, max phase, and first approval. 

It also includes information about the expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process.
