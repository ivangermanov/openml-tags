QSAR-TID-10120 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10120. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 212 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target protein is Mitogen-activated protein kinase eleven, also known as MAP kinase p38 beta. It is a single protein and belongs to the protein family of Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase MAPK family/CMGC protein kinase p38 subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including MAPK cascade, osteoblast differentiation, protein phosphorylation, and positive regulation of gene expression. It is also involved in stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, positive regulation of interleukin-12 production, and intracellular signal transduction.

The protein has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, and has been targeted by several small molecule inhibitors, including RWJ-67657, LOSMAPIMOD, and REGORAFENIB.
