Name: Higgs Seed One Number of Rows Two Thousand Number of Classes Ten Number of Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Higgs generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset. It takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the maximum number of columns.

Finally, the function subsamples the dataset based on the number of rows. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the dataset accordingly and selects a subset of the data.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, the target variable, and a mask indicating which columns are categorical.
