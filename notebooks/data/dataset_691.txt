Wind Dataset: A Binarized Regression Problem for Chemistry and Life Science Studies 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set, which converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset features include Year, Month, Day, and several other variables relevant to chemistry and life science studies. 

The dataset is particularly useful for myth-busting and studying various phenomena in these fields. With its binarized regression problem approach, researchers can explore complex relationships between variables and draw meaningful conclusions.
