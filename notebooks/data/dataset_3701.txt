QSAR-TID-14070 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14070. The dataset has thirty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 14070. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Human Herpesvirus Six Protease, which is a single protein target.

The Human Herpesvirus Six Protease is a serine-type endopeptidase that plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle. It is responsible for the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein, which is essential for the assembly and release of viral particles.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working on the development of inhibitors against the Human Herpesvirus Six Protease. The QSAR data can be used to identify potential inhibitors and to optimize their activity through structure-based design.
