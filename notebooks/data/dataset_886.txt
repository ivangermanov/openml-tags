Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: nitrogen dioxide concentration, cars per hour, temperature at two meters, wind speed, temperature difference between two and twenty-five meters, wind direction, hour of day, binary class

This dataset focuses on air quality measurements, specifically nitrogen dioxide concentrations, and their relationship to various environmental and traffic-related factors. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, where instances are categorized as either positive or negative based on their nitrogen dioxide concentration relative to the mean value. This binarization allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset includes information on traffic density, measured in cars per hour, as well as several meteorological parameters such as temperature at different heights, wind speed, and wind direction. The time of day is also recorded, which may be relevant for understanding daily patterns in air pollution levels.

This binarized version of the dataset is particularly useful for studies related to air quality prediction, traffic impact on pollution levels, and the influence of weather conditions on air pollutants. It can be employed in various machine learning and data mining applications, especially those focused on binary classification tasks.
