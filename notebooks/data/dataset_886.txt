The MC2 Software Defect Prediction dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect datasets. The specific type of software is unknown. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.
