This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-10871, contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10871. It consists of thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It includes data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The drug target, also known as Purinergic Receptor P2Y Eleven, belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is a single protein and its preferred name is P2RY Eleven. Its synonyms include P2RY Eleven, P2Y Purinoceptor Eleven, and others.

This receptor is a neurotransmitter receptor, and it plays a role in defense response, signal transduction, and other biological processes. It is involved in various signaling pathways, including G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, drug target, Purinergic Receptor P2Y Eleven, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction.
