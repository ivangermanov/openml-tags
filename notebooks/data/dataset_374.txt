This database contains the HTML source of web pages plus the ratings of a single user on these web pages. The web pages cover four separate subjects: Bands (recording artists), Goats, Sheep, and BioMedical. The HTML source of each web page is provided. Users examined each web page and indicated their preference on a three point scale (hot, medium, cold). Between fifty and one hundred pages were rated per domain. This approach is realistic because the goal is to learn user profiles from as few examples as possible, providing users with an incentive to rate pages. The primary challenge is to predict user ratings for web pages within a specific subject category. Early publications reported on the accuracy of predicting ratings, while later publications utilized precision at top N or the F measure.

The dataset includes the HTML source of web pages along with user ratings. Users evaluated each page on a three point scale ranging from hot to cold. The number of pages rated per domain varied but was kept intentionally low to encourage user participation and enable learning from minimal examples. The main objective is to develop algorithms capable of predicting user preferences for web pages within defined subject areas. Various evaluation metrics have been employed in related research, including rating prediction accuracy, precision at top results, and F measure.

Features include identification, text content, and classification. The dataset does not contain missing values. The HTML source provides the raw content for each web page, which serves as the basis for analysis and prediction. By focusing on a limited number of ratings per domain, the dataset aims to simulate real world conditions where users may only provide feedback on a small subset of pages.
