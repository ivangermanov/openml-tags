Graph Inference Dataset

Tags: Graphical models, MaRDI, TA3

The Graph Inference Dataset is a collection of graph datasets in CSV format, used in the article "Learning Functional Causal Models with Generative Neural Networks". The dataset consists of two types of files: those without hidden variables and those with hidden variables.

Files without hidden variables are denoted by *_numdata.csv and contain data for around twenty variables connected in a graph. These files are further categorized into four subtypes: G2, G3, G4, and G5, which refer to graphs with two, three, four, and five parents maximum for each node, respectively. Each corresponding *_target.csv file contains the ground truth of the graph, with cause and effect relationships explicitly defined. Additionally, there are larger graphs with one hundred variables, denoted by files starting with "Big".

Files with hidden variables are denoted by *_confounders_numdata.csv and contain data for around twenty variables connected in a graph, with three hidden variables. Each corresponding *_confounders_skeleton.csv file contains the skeleton of the graph, including spurious links due to common hidden causes. The *_confounders_target.csv file contains the ground truth of the graph, with direct visible cause and effect relationships explicitly defined. The task is to recover the direct visible links between cause and effect while removing the spurious links from the skeleton.
