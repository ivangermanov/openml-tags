Name: QSAR-TID-226 Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version 17) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI50) of several compounds on drug target TID: 226, and it has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC50). The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Beta-3 adrenergic receptor, also known as ADRB3 or B3AR. This receptor is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, specifically the monoamine receptor subfamily of adrenergic receptors. The Beta-3 adrenergic receptor is involved in various biological processes, including diet-induced thermogenesis, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, carbohydrate metabolism, energy reserve metabolism, and signal transduction.

Several compounds have been developed to target the Beta-3 adrenergic receptor, including LY377604, Ritobegron, Vibegron, Rafabegron, and Mirabegron. These compounds are small molecules that act as Beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonists and have reached various phases of clinical development. Some of these compounds, such as Vibegron and Mirabegron, have received regulatory approval.

The Beta-3 adrenergic receptor is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in receptor complexes. Its functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, adrenergic receptor activity, protein binding, and specific binding to epinephrine and norepinephrine. The receptor plays roles in various cellular processes, including G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, adenylate cyclase activation, MAPK cascade regulation, and brown fat cell differentiation.
