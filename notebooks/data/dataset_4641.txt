Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed Seed One N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True 

This dataset is a subsampling of the Gesture Phase Segmentation Processed dataset, which consists of four thousand five hundred thirty-eight samples. The subsampling was performed using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of one, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. Additionally, the stratify argument was set to true.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting ten classes out of the total number of unique classes. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, resulting in a reduced number of samples.

Furthermore, the process also involved uniformly sampling columns from the filtered dataset, selecting one hundred columns out of the total number of columns. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the most important features.

The resulting dataset consists of two thousand samples, each with one hundred features. The features are represented by column names ranging from X One to X Thirty-Two, and the target variable is represented by the Phase column.
