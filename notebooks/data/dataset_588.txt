The Friedman Datasets 

These eighty artificially generated datasets originate from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number". 

This Friedman function includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is as follows: y equals ten times sine of pi times x1 times x2 plus twenty times x3 minus point five squared equals ten times X4 plus five times X5 plus e.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 

The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below: 

The number of features varies, including five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Only the first five features are related to the output; the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples also varies, including one hundred, two hundred fifty, five hundred, and one thousand. 

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with colinearity degree four, the number of features is generated as ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. The other datasets have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.
