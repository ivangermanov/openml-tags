The SMSA dataset is a collection of properties of sixty Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States, gathered from various sources. This dataset includes information on the social and economic conditions in these areas, as well as their climate and some indices of air pollution potentials.

The dataset contains a wide range of variables, including the city name, mean January and July temperatures, relative humidity, annual rainfall, age-adjusted mortality, median education, population density, percentage of non-whites, percentage of white-collar workers, population, population per household, median income, hydrocarbon pollution potential, nitrous oxide pollution potential, sulfur dioxide pollution potential, and nitrous oxide.

The dataset was sourced from the US Department of Labor Statistics and is available for free use. It was converted to ARFF format by an unknown contributor and is part of the Data and Story Library, which illustrates the use of basic statistical methods.
