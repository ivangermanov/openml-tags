This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EUR/NZD currency pair obtained from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a daily candlestick, and the entire dataset spans from January to December. Since the Forex market is closed on weekends, there are no entries for Saturday and Sunday.
