Subsampling of the dataset Gina 
Generated with the following source code:

This function enables the subsampling of a given dataset according to specific parameters such as the number of rows, columns, and classes. It utilizes the NumPy library to generate a random default generator based on a specified seed value.

The function initially samples the unique classes present in the dataset and selects a specified maximum number of classes. It then filters the dataset to only include instances belonging to these selected classes.

Furthermore, the function performs uniform sampling of columns if the total number of columns exceeds a predetermined maximum. This is achieved through the use of a random choice function, which selects the desired number of column indices without replacement.

In addition, the function implements stratified sampling of rows according to the class distribution if the total number of rows surpasses a specified maximum. This involves concatenating the dataset with its corresponding class labels, followed by the application of a train-test split function with stratification enabled.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset instance, comprising the subsampled data, along with the corresponding categorical mask and column information.
