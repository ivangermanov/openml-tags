US Accidents Dataset (Tags: Car Accidents, Traffic Incidents, Road Safety)

This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers forty-nine states of the United States of America. The accident data are collected from February to December, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident or event data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks.
