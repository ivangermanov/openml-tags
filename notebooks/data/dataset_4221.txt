The Bank Marketing Data Set UCI is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. These marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required in order to assess whether the product, namely a bank term deposit, would be subscribed or not.

There are four datasets available: bank additional full, bank additional, bank full, and bank. The largest dataset, bank additional full, contains all forty-one thousand one hundred eighty-eight examples and twenty input variables, ordered chronologically from May two thousand eight to November two thousand ten. This dataset is very similar to the data analyzed in previous studies. A smaller dataset, bank additional, contains only ten percent of the examples, randomly selected from the larger dataset, and also includes twenty input variables. The older versions of these datasets, bank full and bank, contain seventeen input variables and fewer examples.

The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not, which is represented by the output variable y.

Input variables include:

* Age, which represents the client's age
* Job, which represents the type of job held by the client
* Marital Status, which represents the client's marital status
* Education, which represents the client's level of education
* Default, which indicates whether the client has credit in default
* Balance, which represents the average yearly balance in euros
* Housing, which indicates whether the client has a housing loan
* Loan, which indicates whether the client has a personal loan
* Contact, which represents the type of communication used in the last contact
* Day, which represents the last contact day of the month
* Month, which represents the last contact month of the year
* Duration, which represents the last contact duration in seconds
* Campaign, which represents the number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client
* Pdays, which represents the number of days that passed since the client was last contacted from a previous campaign
* Previous, which represents the number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client
* Poutcome, which represents the outcome of the previous marketing campaign

Output variable y represents whether the client has subscribed a term deposit or not.
