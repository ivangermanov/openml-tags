QSAR-TID-10962 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10962. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10962. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Prolyl Endopeptidase enzyme, which is a single protein target. The enzyme is also known as Post-proline Cleaving Enzyme or PREP, and it belongs to the Serine Protease SC clan and Serine Protease S9A subfamily. The enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, and it has been implicated in several diseases.

The dataset provides information on the enzyme's function, including its serine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and oligopeptidase activity. The dataset also provides information on the enzyme's cellular component, including its location in the cytoplasm and cytosol.
