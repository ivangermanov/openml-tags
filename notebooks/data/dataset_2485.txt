Climate Model Simulation Crashes Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Economics, OpenML-CC18

This dataset contains records of simulation crashes encountered during climate model uncertainty quantification ensembles. Ensemble members were constructed using a Latin Hypercube method in LLNL's Uncertainty Quantification Pipeline software system to sample the uncertainties of eighteen model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program component of the Community Climate System Model.

The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) from input parameter values, and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to determine the causes of simulation crashes.

The dataset consists of twenty-one attributes, including eighteen climate model input parameters scaled in the interval zero to one, and one attribute representing the simulation outcome, which is either zero for failure or one for success.

Data Set Information:

This dataset was constructed using LLNL's Uncertainty Quantification Pipeline and was created under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Attribute Information:

The eighteen climate model input parameters include various constants, correction factors, and scale values related to ocean currents, atmospheric conditions, and other environmental factors. The outcome attribute indicates whether the simulation crashed or succeeded.
