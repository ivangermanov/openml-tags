QSAR-TID-11678 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Cyclin-dependent Kinase Two, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about Cyclin-dependent Kinase Two, a single protein that is a preferred name for Cell Division Protein Kinase Two. It is also known as CDK Two, CDKN Two, and p thirty-three Protein Kinase. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase family and is involved in the cell cycle process.

The dataset provides information about the protein's function, including its role in the cell cycle, DNA replication, and repair. It also provides information about its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in various biological processes.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying Cyclin-dependent Kinase Two and its role in the cell cycle and cancer.
