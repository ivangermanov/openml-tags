The DB World e-mails dataset is a collection of sixty-four emails obtained from the DB World newsletter. This dataset was used to train various algorithms to classify emails into two categories: announces of conferences and everything else.

The dataset uses a binary bag-of-words representation with stopword removal preprocessing. Each attribute in the dataset corresponds to a specific word or stem in the entire dataset vocabulary.

The dataset was created to explore email classification using a small corpus. The goal was to develop an effective method for distinguishing between conference announcements and other types of emails.

Relevant papers include a project on machine learning course at the University of Manchester, which discusses email classification using this dataset.

Keywords: email classification, bag-of-words representation, stopword removal, conference announcements, machine learning.
