**Diabetes Bayesian Network Sample**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn repository and represents a model-based approach to insulin adjustment for diabetes patients. The network consists of nodes and arcs that capture the complex relationships between various factors influencing blood glucose levels.

The network has a large number of nodes, representing different variables related to meal intake, carbohydrate absorption, insulin sensitivity, and other physiological processes. These variables interact with each other through a web of arcs, which represent conditional dependencies between them.

One of the key features of this network is its ability to model the dynamic behavior of blood glucose levels over time, taking into account factors such as meal composition, insulin absorption, and renal clearance. This allows for a more accurate prediction of blood glucose levels and informs personalized insulin dosing recommendations.

The network also incorporates various types of uncertainty, including measurement error and parameter uncertainty, to provide a more realistic representation of the underlying biological systems.

Features of this network include meal composition, carbohydrate absorption rates, insulin sensitivity, and blood glucose levels over time.
