QSAR-TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including IDs and class features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a single protein target named Rhodesain, also known as Cysteine protease rhodesain. This protein is found in the organism Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. It is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Cysteine protease/Cysteine protease CA clan/Cysteine protease CA family.

The protein has several associated Gene Ontology (GO) functions, including cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. Its GO process is identified as proteolysis. The protein is also associated with various database entries, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.

InterPro entries for this protein include Peptidase CA, Peptidase CA C, Protein inhibitor I, and several others related to peptidase and protease functions. Pfam entries include Peptidase C, Inhibitor I, and DUF. The protein structure is represented in multiple PDB entries.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is intended for use in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. It provides valuable information for researchers studying drug interactions and protein targets, particularly in the context of cysteine proteases and potential therapeutic applications.
