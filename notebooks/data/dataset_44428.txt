Subsampling of the dataset Jannis with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and no stratify equal to true. 

Generated with the following source code: 

A function called subsample takes in self, seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as parameters. It returns a dataset. 

The function first initializes a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects the data and target values from the dataset. 

If the number of unique classes in the target values is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects a subset of classes using a random choice, with the probability of each class being selected proportional to its frequency in the target values. 

It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data and target values accordingly. 

If the number of columns in the data is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects a subset of columns using a random choice. 

If the number of rows in the data is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. 

Finally, it returns a new dataset with the filtered data and target values, along with the categorical mask and column names.
