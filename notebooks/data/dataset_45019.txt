Bioresponse 
Tags: Agriculture, Machine Learning 

This dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. 

The Bioresponse dataset is designed to predict a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties. Each row in this dataset represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response, or not. The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors, which are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule, such as size, shape, or elemental constitution. 

The descriptor matrix has been normalized. The original training and test sets were merged. 

Features include various molecular descriptors, capturing characteristics such as size, shape, and elemental constitution.
