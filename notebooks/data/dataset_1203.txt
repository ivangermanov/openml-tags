Tags: artificial, BNG

Features: a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, class

This dataset, known as BNG (pwLinear), is an artificial dataset with multiple features. It is tagged as both artificial and BNG, indicating its synthetic nature and association with the BNG methodology. The dataset contains several attributes labeled from 'a' to 'a', along with a class feature. This structure suggests a multi-dimensional dataset designed for machine learning or statistical analysis purposes, likely focusing on linear relationships between variables.
