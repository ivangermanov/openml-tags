QSAR-TID-101356 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Pyroglutamylated RFamide Peptide Receptor, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP features.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Pyroglutamylated RFamide Peptide Receptor. The Pyroglutamylated RFamide Peptide Receptor is a single protein, also known as AQ twenty-seven, GPR one hundred three, G-protein coupled receptor one hundred three, Orexigenic Neuropeptide QRFP Receptor, and Pyroglutamylated RF-amide Peptide Receptor. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor. It is involved in signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, and cellular response to hormone stimulus.

The receptor is expressed in Homo sapiens, and it has been studied in various databases, including ExpressionAtlas, GoComponent, GoFunction, GoProcess, Wikipedia, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
