This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Pyroglutamylated RFamide Peptide Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, numerous fingerprint features representing molecular structure and properties.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It provides valuable information for researchers studying the relationship between chemical structures and biological activities.

The Pyroglutamylated RFamide Peptide Receptor is a single protein and is also known as AQ twenty-seven, GPR one hundred three, Orexigenic Neuropeptide QRFP Receptor, among other synonyms. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor and a peptide receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, and cellular response to hormone stimulus. It is also associated with several functions, such as G protein-coupled receptor activity, neuropeptide Y receptor activity, protein binding, and peptide binding.
