**FOREX EUR/GBP Day High**

Tags: Finance, Forex, Forex Day, Forex High, Text and Literature

This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex EUR/GBP pair, sourced from Dukascopy's Historical Data Feed.

One instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one trading day. The entire dataset spans a specific date range and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high price of the following day, relative to the mean high price of the current day. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price is expected to increase the following day, and false when the mean high price is expected to decrease or remain unchanged.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions. Realistic trade strategies require predictions based on close attributes, which are also available.

* Timestamp: The time of the current data point
* Bid Open: The bid price at the start of the time interval
* Bid High: The highest bid price during the time interval
* Bid Low: The lowest bid price during the time interval
