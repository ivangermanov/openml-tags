Concept Drift: Spellman Yeast Dataset

This dataset consists of a series of experiments designed to identify which genes in yeast are cell cycle regulated, using two-color spotted cDNA array data. The experiments involve various cell cycle stages, including the G1 phase, S phase, G2 phase, and M phase.

The dataset features several cell cycle regulators, including Cln3, Clb, and Cdc28, which are essential for cell cycle progression. Additionally, the dataset includes features related to the alpha factor, which is a mating pheromone that arrests yeast cells in the G1 phase.

The dataset also includes features related to the Cdc15 protein, which is involved in the regulation of the mitotic exit network. Furthermore, the dataset features the Elu protein, which is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.
