Mildew Bayesian Network. Sample 2.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository references this network, which has thirty-five nodes and forty-six arcs. The number of parameters totals five hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty. The average Markov blanket size is four point five seven, and the average degree is two point six three. The maximum in-degree is three.

This network is a representation of the Mildew dataset, which models the influence diagram for management of mildew in winter wheat.

The network includes various features related to wheat growth, weather conditions, and disease management.

Proceedings of the conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence provide more information about this network.
