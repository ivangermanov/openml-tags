QSAR-TID-10903 Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10903, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides information about Protein Kinase C Mu, also known as Serine Threonine Protein Kinase D One, which is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. It plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, metabolism, and apoptosis.

Protein Kinase C Mu is involved in multiple biological processes, including angiogenesis, inflammatory response, nervous system development, and cellular response to oxidative stress. It interacts with various proteins and molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and regulates gene expression by phosphorylating transcription factors.

The dataset provides valuable insights into the structure and function of Protein Kinase C Mu, which can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders.
