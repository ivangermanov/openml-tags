This dataset focuses on speaker-independent recognition of eleven steady-state vowels in British English using log area ratios derived from linear predictive coding. The data was collected for connectionist analysis and includes a comprehensive description with author comments.

The problem is defined by a three-dimensional array: voweldata [speaker, vowel, input]. Speakers are indexed by integers, representing fifteen individuals each pronouncing each vowel six times. Vowels are indexed by integers. Each utterance has ten floating-point input values.

The challenge is to train a network using data from a subset of speakers and test it on the remaining speakers, reporting the number of correct classifications in the test set. The goal is to maximize performance in a problem without an exact solution, rather than focusing solely on training speed.

Methodology:
Report the number of test vowels classified correctly, based on the smallest distance between the actual output and all possible target outputs. Additionally, report training duration (measured in pattern presentations or floating-point operations), success levels on training and testing data at various stages, and provide a precise description of the network topology and algorithm used.

Variations:
This benchmark encourages exploration of different node types. Theorizing, experimenting, and hacking are welcome. The use of a cross-entropy distance measure has been discussed and results for this approach would be of interest.

The dataset includes information on speakers, vowels, and input features. It is designed for classification tasks in speech recognition and has been used in various studies exploring neural network architectures and learning algorithms.
