This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Eleven, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Eleven. 

The preferred name of this protein is Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Eleven, also known as Map Three Kinase Eleven. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, TKL protein kinase group, TKL protein kinase MLK family, and TKL protein kinase MLK subfamily.
