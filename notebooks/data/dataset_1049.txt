PC4 Software Defect Prediction

One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect datasets, PC4 contains data from flight software for an Earth-orbiting satellite. This dataset comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code, which were defined in the seventies in an attempt to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.
