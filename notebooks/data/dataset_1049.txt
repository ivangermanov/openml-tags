This dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. It contains data from flight software for an earth orbiting satellite. The data was extracted using McCabe and Halstead feature extractors of source code. These features were defined in an attempt to objectively characterize code features associated with software quality.

The dataset includes various software metrics such as lines of code, branch count, cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics, and others. These metrics aim to quantify different aspects of the source code that may correlate with software defects.

Relevant papers discuss the quality of NASA software defect datasets, blind spot sampling policies in software engineering, and the assessment of software defect predictors. These studies contribute to the understanding of software quality prediction and the effectiveness of various metrics in identifying potential defects.

The PC4 dataset is part of a larger collection of software engineering databases used for research in defect prediction and software quality assessment. It has been utilized in multiple studies exploring the relationships between code metrics and software defects.
