The QSAR-TID-12967 dataset is a collection of QSAR data that shows activity values of various compounds on a specific drug target. This dataset contains 2756 rows and 1026 features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature that represents the median pseudo-pCI50. 

The features in this dataset represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015 and is based on data from ChEMBL version 17.
