Data Set Information:
Impedance measurements were conducted on freshly excised breast tissue at various frequencies: fifteen point six two five, thirty-one point two five, sixty-two point five, one hundred twenty-five, two hundred fifty, five hundred, and one thousand kilohertz. These measurements, when plotted in the (real, negative imaginary) plane, form the impedance spectrum from which breast tissue features are computed. The dataset can be used to predict the classification of either the original six classes or four classes by combining the fibro-adenoma, mastopathy, and glandular classes, as their discrimination is not crucial and cannot be accurately differentiated anyway.

Attribute Information:
I zero: Impedivity (ohm) at zero frequency
PA five hundred: Phase angle at five hundred kilohertz
HFS: High-frequency slope of phase angle
DA: Impedance distance between spectral ends
AREA: Area under spectrum
A/DA: Area normalized by DA
MAX IP: Maximum of the spectrum
DR: Distance between I zero and real part of the maximum frequency point
P: Length of the spectral curve
Class: Carcinoma, fibro-adenoma plus mastopathy plus glandular, connective, adipose

Features: V one, V two, V three, V four, V five, V six, V seven, V eight, V nine, Class
