QSAR-TID-101058 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101058. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101058. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate Fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on specific drug targets.

The dataset contains information on the Casein Kinase I Isoform Gamma-3, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as Casein Kinase I Isoform Gamma-3, CKI-gamma 3, and CSNK1G3. It is a member of the CK1 protein kinase family and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and Wnt signaling pathway.

The dataset provides information on the expression of the protein in different tissues and cells, as well as its subcellular localization. The protein is expressed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane, and is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and Wnt signaling pathway.
