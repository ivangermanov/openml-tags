The QSAR-TID-101058 dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase I Isoform Gamma-3. This dataset has been extracted from ChEMBL version seventeen and consists of five hundred ninety-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite this source when using the data. The dataset provides information about the activity of various compounds on the specified drug target, which is essential for understanding their effects and potential applications.

The Casein Kinase I Isoform Gamma-3 is a single protein target that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group and is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and Wnt signaling pathways.

The dataset also provides information about the expression atlas, gene ontology, and other relevant details about the target protein.
