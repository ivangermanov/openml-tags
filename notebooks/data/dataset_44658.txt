Name: Churn Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Churn with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max equal to two thousand, ncols max equal to one hundred, nclasses max equal to ten, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and stratified as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes and columns. If the number of unique classes is greater than nclasses max, it selects the top nclasses max classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than ncols max, it uniformly samples columns and subsets the data. If the number of rows is greater than nrows max, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
