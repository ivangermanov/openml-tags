This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The conversion process involves taking the numeric target feature and transforming it into a two-class nominal target feature. This is achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

The features included in this dataset are Age and Civil Status.
