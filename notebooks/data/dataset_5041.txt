**Pigs Bayesian Network Sample**

This dataset is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, specifically listed under discrete very large networks.

The Pigs Bayesian Network consists of four hundred forty-one nodes connected by five hundred ninety-two arcs, resulting in a total of five thousand six hundred eighteen parameters. The average Markov blanket size for this network is approximately three point sixty-six, while the average degree is around two point sixty-eight. Notably, the maximum in-degree for any node is two.

Some notable features of this network include various characteristics related to pig health and medicine, although the exact details are not readily apparent due to the complex naming conventions used.

This network is particularly interesting for those working in machine learning and medicine, as it provides a rich source of data for analysis and modeling. By examining the relationships between different nodes and arcs, researchers may uncover valuable insights into pig health and disease prevention.
