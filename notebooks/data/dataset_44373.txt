Name: Electricity Seed One 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Electricity with seed equals one arguments number of rows equals two thousand arguments number of columns equals one hundred arguments number of classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals true 

Generated with the following source code: 

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. 

First, it sets up a random number generator with the given seed. Then, it gets the features and target from the dataset. 

It uniformly samples classes from the target. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes using their value counts as probabilities. 

It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the features and target accordingly. 

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the maximum number of columns randomly and subsets the features accordingly. 

If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly and subsets it using train test split. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string for openml and returns a dataset with the subsetted features, target, categorical mask, and columns.
