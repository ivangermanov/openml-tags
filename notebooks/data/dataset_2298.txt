The QSAR-TID-20105 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20105. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.

The drug target is cathepsin K, also known as cathepsin K CTSK protein OC-two, which belongs to the enzyme/protease/cysteine protease/cysteine protease CA clan/cysteine protease C one A family.

Cathepsin K is an enzyme that plays a role in various biological processes, including proteolysis, thyroid hormone generation, collagen catabolic process, bone resorption, proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process, and negative regulation of cartilage development. It is located in the extracellular region, extracellular space, nucleoplasm, lysosome, plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, membrane, apical plasma membrane, and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle.

Keywords: QSAR, cathepsin K, molecular fingerprints, MetaQSAR, enzyme, protease, cysteine protease.
