Tags: Finance, Forex, Forex High, Forex Minute, Health, Medicine

This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex aud/chf currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute duration. The dataset covers the period from January to December and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is based on the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is defined as the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent minute relative to the mean high price of the current minute. In other words, if the mean high price increases in the following minute, the class attribute is labeled as true; otherwise, it is labeled as false.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for real-world trading strategies. For realistic trading applications, predictions based on close attributes (also available) would be more suitable.
