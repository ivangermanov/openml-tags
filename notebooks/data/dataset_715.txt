Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one through oz twenty five, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, likely used for various studies and mythbusting purposes. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification, with instances below the mean labeled as positive and those above as negative. This conversion allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression task. The dataset contains multiple features, labeled as oz one through oz twenty five, along with a binary class feature that represents the transformed target variable.
