The ADA dataset is a marketing database that aims to identify high-revenue individuals based on census data. This is a two-class classification problem where the goal is to distinguish between individuals who earn more than fifty thousand dollars per year and those who do not.

The dataset originates from the Adult database in the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It consists of fourteen original attributes, including age, work class, education level, marital status, occupation, native country, and others. These attributes encompass continuous, binary, and categorical features.

This particular dataset belongs to the prior knowledge track, meaning it has access to the original features and their identities. The dataset comprises samples from both the training and validation sets.

The attributes included in this dataset are:

* Age, which represents an individual's age
* Work Class, which categorizes an individual's employment type
* Sampling Weight, which assigns a numerical value to each sample
* Education Level, which describes an individual's educational background
* Education Numerical Value, which provides a numerical representation of an individual's education level
* Marital Status, which defines an individual's marital situation
* Occupation, which specifies an individual's profession
* Relationship Type, which characterizes an individual's relationships
* Race, which identifies an individual's racial background
* Sex, which indicates an individual's gender
* Capital Gain, which quantifies an individual's financial gains
* Capital Loss, which measures an individual's financial losses
* Working Hours Per Week, which records the number of hours an individual works weekly
* Native Country, which specifies an individual's country of origin
* Label, which serves as the class attribute, distinguishing between individuals who earn more than fifty thousand dollars per year and those who do not
