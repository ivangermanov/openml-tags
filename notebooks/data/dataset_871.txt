Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Ridge, Nub, Crack, Weight, Density, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Pollen, is a binarized regression problem used for mythbusting and various studies. The original numeric target feature has been converted into a binary classification task. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset includes several features that describe characteristics of pollen samples, such as ridge formation, presence of nubs, cracks in the structure, weight, and density. The final feature, binary class, represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.

Researchers and data scientists interested in exploring the transition between regression and classification problems may find this dataset particularly useful. It provides an opportunity to compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms on both the original regression task and the derived binary classification problem.
