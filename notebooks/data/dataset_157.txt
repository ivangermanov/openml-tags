The Computer Activity database is a comprehensive collection of computer systems activity measures. This dataset was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 megabytes of memory running in a multi-user university department, where users would typically engage in a wide range of activities, including accessing the internet, editing files, or running CPU-bound programs.

The data was collected continuously on two separate occasions, with system activity being gathered every five seconds on both occasions. The final dataset combines data from both collections, with an equal number of observations coming from each collection epoch.

This dataset includes various system measures, including reads and writes between system memory and user memory, system calls, reads and writes, forks, executions, character transfers, page outs, page ins, and page faults. It also captures process run queue sizes, available memory pages, available disk blocks for page swapping, and CPU usage percentages in user mode, system mode, idle waiting for block I/O, and otherwise idle.

The two different regression tasks obtained from this dataset are predicting the percentage of time CPUs run in user mode from all attributes, and predicting the same using a restricted set of attributes excluding paging information.

Characteristics of this dataset include 8192 cases and 13 continuous attributes, featuring reads, writes, system calls, reads, writes, forks, executions, character transfers, process run queue sizes, available memory pages, and available disk blocks for page swapping.
