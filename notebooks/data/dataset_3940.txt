This case revolves around Thera Bank, which aims to convert its liability customers into personal loan customers while maintaining their status as depositors. Last year, the bank launched a campaign targeting liability customers, yielding a remarkable conversion rate exceeding nine percent. This encouraging outcome prompted the retail marketing department to design more targeted campaigns, seeking to enhance the success ratio while operating within a limited budget.

The dataset, aptly named Bank, comprises information on five thousand customers. It encompasses customer demographic details, including age and income, as well as the nature of their relationship with the bank, such as mortgage and securities accounts. Additionally, the dataset includes responses to the previous personal loan campaign.

Among these five thousand customers, a mere subset accepted the personal loan offer extended during the earlier campaign. The dataset lacks any empty or missing values. It features a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, although all categorical data are numerically represented. Furthermore, some predictor variables exhibit significant skewness, rendering data preprocessing a fascinating yet manageable challenge.

Features include identification information, customer age, experience, income, postal codes, family status, credit card average, education level, mortgage and securities account holdings, certificate of deposit accounts, online banking usage, and credit card ownership.
