QSAR-TID-11150 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11150. The dataset has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Death Associated Protein Kinase One. Death Associated Protein Kinase One is a single protein, also known as DAPK, DAPK One, and Death Associated Protein Kinase One. It is a protein target classification of one enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, CAMK protein kinase group, and CAMK protein kinase DAPK family.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.
