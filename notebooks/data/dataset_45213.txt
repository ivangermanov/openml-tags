This dataset consists of 223 nodes and 338 arcs, with a total of 1157 parameters. The average Markov blanket size is 5.61, and the average degree is 3.03, with a maximum in-degree of 6.

The Andes Bayesian Network is a model for online student modeling for coached problem solving using Bayesian networks. It is a large and complex network that represents the relationships between various variables in a problem-solving environment.

The network features a range of nodes, including those related to goals, actions, and problem-solving strategies. These nodes are connected by arcs that represent the probabilistic relationships between them.

The Andes Bayesian Network has been used in a variety of applications, including intelligent tutoring systems and educational software.
