Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: x one, x two, x three, x four, x five, x six, x seven, x eight, x nine, x ten, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, likely used for various studies and mythbusting purposes. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification task, where instances are categorized as either positive or negative based on their relation to the computed mean value. This conversion allows for the application of binary classification algorithms and techniques to what was originally a regression problem. The dataset contains multiple features, labeled from x one through x ten, along with a binary class indicator. Researchers and data scientists may find this dataset useful for exploring the differences between regression and classification approaches, as well as for testing hypotheses related to data transformation and its effects on model performance.
