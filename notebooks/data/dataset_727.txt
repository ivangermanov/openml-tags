Binarized Version of No2 Dataset 

This dataset is a binarized regression problem that involves the field of chemistry and life science. The original dataset has been modified to create a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the numeric target feature and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive (classified as 'P') and all others as negative (classified as 'N').

The features of this dataset include concentration of nitrogen dioxide, number of cars per hour, temperature measured at two meters, wind speed, difference in temperature between two meters and twenty-five meters, wind direction, and time of day.
