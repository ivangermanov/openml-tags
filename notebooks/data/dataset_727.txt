The Two D Planes dataset is a binarized regression problem that originates from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This particular version of the dataset is a modification of the original, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

This dataset consists of several features, including various chemical and biological properties. These features have been anonymized and are represented by labels such as Feature One, Feature Two, and so on.

This dataset is often used for myth-busting and study purposes, particularly in the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. It is an important resource for researchers and scientists looking to understand the relationships between various chemical and biological properties.
