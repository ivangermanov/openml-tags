Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Time index, Season, Month, Unemployment rate, Binary Class

This dataset contains information about accidents in Michigan, with various temporal and economic factors recorded. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, where instances are labeled as either positive or negative based on their relation to the mean target value. This binarization allows for easier analysis and modeling of accident patterns. The features include time-based information such as season and month, as well as economic indicators like the unemployment rate. Researchers and analysts can use this dataset to study potential correlations between these factors and accident occurrences in Michigan.
