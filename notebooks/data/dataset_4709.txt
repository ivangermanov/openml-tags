Machine learning dataset, volkert, with the following characteristics:

This dataset was generated through subsampling of the original volkert dataset. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes, followed by uniform sampling of columns and rows. 

The class selection process ensured that the resulting dataset had a maximum number of classes. This was achieved by calculating the value counts of each class and then using these value counts as probabilities to select the desired number of classes.

Once the classes were selected, the corresponding rows were extracted from the original dataset. Next, the column selection process involved uniformly choosing the desired number of columns from the remaining dataset.

Finally, the row selection process involved stratified sampling to ensure that the resulting dataset had the desired number of rows while maintaining the class distribution.

This dataset has been tagged under machine learning and mathematics.

Features include various variables such as demographic and numerical attributes.

Keywords: machine learning, dataset, subsampling, stratification, class selection, column selection, row selection.
