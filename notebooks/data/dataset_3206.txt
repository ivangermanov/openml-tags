This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred one thousand fifty five, and it has eighty one rows and one thousand twenty six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI fifty.

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target interleukin-one receptor associated kinase three, also known as IRAK three. 

Interleukin-one receptor associated kinase three is a single protein that is preferred and is also known as IL-one receptor associated kinase M or inactive IL-one receptor associated kinase three. It belongs to the species group of homo sapiens and its protein target classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase TKL protein kinase group TKL protein kinase IRAK family.

Expression Atlas shows that this protein is expressed in certain tissues and it has certain functions such as nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, protein kinase binding, identical protein binding, and protein homodimerization activity. 

This protein is involved in various biological processes such as positive regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of cytokine mediated signaling pathway, MyD eighty eight dependent toll like receptor signaling pathway, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, response to virus, regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic process, and positive regulation of macrophage tolerance induction.
