QSAR-TID-101055 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101055. The dataset has eighty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase three protein.

Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase three is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses. It is involved in the signaling pathways of various cytokines, including interleukin-1, and is a potential target for the development of new therapeutic agents.

The protein is a member of the IRAK family and is characterized by its death domain and protein kinase domain. It is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and cytokine production.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers seeking to understand the structure-activity relationships of compounds targeting Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase three.
