The Monk's Problems: Problem Three

Dataset Name: monks-problems-three
Tags: artificial, mythbusting, OpenML, study, uci

Once upon a time, in July, the monks of Corsendonk Priory were faced with a school held in their priory, namely the Second European Summer School on Machine Learning. After listening for more than one week to a wide variety of learning algorithms, they felt rather confused: Which algorithm would be optimal? And which one to avoid? As a consequence of this dilemma, they created a simple task on which all learning algorithms ought to be compared: the three Monk's problems.

The target concept associated with the third Monk's problem is the binary outcome of the logical formula:

MONK-THREE: (attribute five equals three and attribute four equals one) or (attribute five does not equal four and attribute two does not equal three)

In addition, five percent class noise was added to the training set. In this dataset, the original train and test sets were merged to allow other sampling procedures. However, the original train-test splits can be found as one of the OpenML tasks.

Attribute Information:
- attribute one: one, two, three
- attribute two: one, two, three
- attribute three: one, two
- attribute four: one, two, three
- attribute five: one, two, three, four
- attribute six: one, two

The Monk's problems were the basis of a first international comparison of learning algorithms. The result of this comparison is summarized in a technical report published by Carnegie Mellon University. One significant characteristic of this comparison is that it was performed by a collection of researchers, each of whom was an advocate of the technique they tested (often they were the creators of the various methods). In this sense, the results are less biased than in comparisons performed by a single person advocating a specific learning method, and more accurately reflect the generalization behavior of the learning techniques as applied by knowledgeable users.

There are three Monk's problems. The domains for all Monk's problems are the same. One of the Monk's problems has noise added. For each problem, the domain has been partitioned into a train and test set.

This dataset does not have missing values.
