The QSAR-TID-103063 dataset is a collection of QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103063. It contains thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset provides information about the Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase mTOR, also known as the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin. It is an enzyme that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol three kinase-related kinase family and plays a key role in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and survival.

The dataset includes information about the protein's classification, function, and process involvement. It is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, and Atypical Protein Kinase belonging to the PIKK family and FRAP subfamily.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including regulation of cell growth, protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, heart morphogenesis, and response to stress. It is also involved in negative regulation of autophagy, positive regulation of lamellipodium assembly, and positive regulation of gene expression.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about the protein's molecular function, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, and ATP binding.

Keywords: QSAR, mTOR, protein kinase, cell growth, metabolism, survival, autophagy, gene expression.
