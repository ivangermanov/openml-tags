California Housing Prices
Tags: Context

This dataset is used in the second chapter of a recent book and serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables, and sits at an optimal size between being too toyish and too cumbersome. The data contains information from the California census and, although it may not help with predicting current housing prices, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.

The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary statistics about them based on the census data. Be warned that the data are not cleaned, so there are some preprocessing steps required. The columns are as follows, and their names are pretty self-explanatory: longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.

This data was initially featured in a paper and I encountered it in a book. The dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from a university page.

Inspiration can be found in a kernel on machine learning basics using this dataset, or venture over to a link for a Python-based introductory tutorial.
