Name: MIP 2016 Regression

Tags: Features

This dataset contains a wide range of features that describe mixed-integer programming problems. These features include instance identification, problem type, and various characteristics of the problem's variables and constraints.

The features include the number of variables, constraints, and non-zero coefficients, as well as the average and variance of the linear programming relaxation's objective value and solution. Additionally, there are features that describe the distribution of the variables, such as the number and ratio of binary, integer, continuous, and semi-continuous variables.

Other features include the support size and variance of the constraints, the average and variance of the right-hand side coefficients, and the degree and weight of the variables and constraints in the constraint graph. There are also features that describe the objective coefficients, such as their average, standard deviation, and distribution.

Furthermore, the dataset includes features that describe the variance and coefficient of variation of the support size, right-hand side coefficients, and objective coefficients. There are also features that describe the distribution of the variables and constraints, such as the average and variance of the variable and constraint degrees.

Keywords: Mixed-Integer Programming, Linear Programming Relaxation, Variable Characteristics, Constraint Characteristics, Objective Coefficients.
