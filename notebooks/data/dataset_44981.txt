**Data Description**
A realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Puma 560 robot arm is presented in this dataset. The task is to predict the angular acceleration of one of the robot arm's links, which is a nonlinear and high-noise task. The simulator takes as input the angular positions, velocities, and torques, as well as other dynamic parameters of the Puma arm. The goal is to predict the acceleration of the sixth link.

**Attribute Description**
The attributes in this dataset include the angular positions of links one to six, the angular velocities of links one to six, the torques at joints one to five, the changes in mass of links one to five, the changes in length of links one to five, and the changes in viscous friction of links one to five. The target feature is the acceleration of the sixth link.

The attributes are comprised of the following: angular position of link one, angular position of link two, angular position of link three, angular position of link four, angular position of link five, angular position of link six, angular velocity of link one, angular velocity of link two, angular velocity of link three, angular velocity of link four, angular velocity of link five, angular velocity of link six, torque at joint one, torque at joint two, torque at joint three, torque at joint four, torque at joint five, change in mass of link one, change in mass of link two, change in mass of link three, change in mass of link four, change in mass of link five, change in length of link one, change in length of link two, change in length of link three, change in length of link four, change in length of link five, change in viscous friction of link one, change in viscous friction of link two, change in viscous friction of link three, change in viscous friction of link four, change in viscous friction of link five, and acceleration of link six.
