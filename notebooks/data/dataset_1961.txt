The QSAR-TID-11615 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine, also known as Gelatinase B, which belongs to the Metallo Protease M Ten A Subfamily.

This dataset has thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature, representing FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine is a single protein preferred name, also known as ninety-two kilodalton gelatinase, ninety-two kilodalton type four collagenase, Gelatinase B, and Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine. It belongs to the enzyme protease metallo protease metallo protease MAM clan metallo protease M ten A subfamily.

It is involved in various biological processes, including skeletal system development, ossification, response to hypoxia, kidney development, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of leukocyte migration, proteolysis, apoptotic process, response to oxidative stress, heart development, embryo implantation, parturition, response to nutrient, response to xenobiotic stimulus, response to mechanical stimulus, response to high light intensity, response to organic substance, response to organic cyclic compound, cell migration, protein catabolic process, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, positive regulation of synaptic plasticity, response to estradiol, response to lipopolysaccharide, response to retinoic acid, response to vitamin A, response to tumor necrosis factor, cellular response to reactive oxygen species, response to nicotine, endodermal cell differentiation, positive regulation of apoptotic process, negative regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of DNA binding, response to ethanol, positive regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of angiogenesis, negative regulation of fibroblast proliferation, macrophage chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, response to stimulus, positive regulation of keratinocyte migration, response to hyperoxia, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cellular response to cadmium ion, cellular response to iron three plus ion, cellular response to cytokine stimulus, cellular response to interleukin one, cellular response to tumor necrosis factor, cellular response to low density lipoprotein particle stimulus, cellular response to cell matrix adhesion, cellular response to UV-A, positive regulation of release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, positive regulation of receptor binding, response to amyloid beta, positive regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell proliferation, negative regulation of epithelial cell differentiation involved in kidney development, negative regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, and negative regulation of cation channel activity.
