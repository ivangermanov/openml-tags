**Link Bayesian Network**

This Bayesian network repository reference is available online.

The Link Bayesian Network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex network. It has an average Markov blanket size and an average degree, indicating a moderate level of connectivity among its nodes. The maximum in-degree of the network is also notable.

This network was originally used for linkage analysis in large pedigrees with many loops.

Features of this network include various variables related to pedigree data, such as genotype and phenotype information. These features are essential for understanding the relationships within the network.
