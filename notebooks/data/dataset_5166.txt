Online Shoppers Intention Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to individual user sessions over a one-year period, carefully curated to avoid any bias towards a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. This approach ensures a diverse range of data points, representative of various user behaviors and preferences.

Attribute Information:

The dataset comprises ten numerical and eight categorical attributes. The revenue attribute serves as the class label, allowing for analysis and prediction of online shoppers' intentions. 

Six attributes - administrative, administrative duration, informational, informational duration, product related, and product-related duration - capture the number of different types of pages visited by users in a session and the total time spent in each category. These values are dynamically derived from URL information and updated in real-time as users navigate through the website.

Three attributes - bounce rate, exit rate, and page value - represent key metrics measured by Google Analytics for each page in the e-commerce site. Bounce rate refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from a particular page and then leave without triggering any further requests. Exit rate calculates the percentage of page views that mark the end of a session. Page value represents the average value for a web page that a user visits before completing a transaction.

The special day attribute indicates the proximity of a website visit to a specific special day, such as Mother's Day or Valentine's Day, when transactions are more likely to occur. This value considers the dynamics of e-commerce, including the duration between order date and delivery date.

Additional attributes include operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type (returning or new), a boolean value indicating whether the visit occurred on a weekend, and the month of the year.
