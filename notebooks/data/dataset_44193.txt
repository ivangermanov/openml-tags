The Weather Problem is a small dataset that will be used repeatedly to illustrate various machine learning methods. This entirely fictional dataset supposedly concerns the conditions that are suitable for playing some unspecified outdoor game. In general, instances in a dataset are characterized by the values of features or attributes that measure different aspects of the instance. In this particular case, there are four attributes that describe the weather conditions: outlook, which refers to the general weather situation; temperature, which measures the warmth or coolness of the air; humidity, which indicates the amount of moisture in the air; and windy, which describes the presence or absence of wind. The outcome or target variable is whether to play the game or not.
