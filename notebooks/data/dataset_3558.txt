The QSAR-TID-100826 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y6. This dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. The Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y6 is a single protein target that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is primarily involved in signal transduction pathways and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including phagocytosis, smooth muscle cell migration, and transepithelial chloride transport.

The dataset includes features such as molecular fingerprints, which are used to describe the structural properties of molecules. These features are essential for building QSAR models that can predict the activity of compounds against specific drug targets. The dataset also includes information about the protein target, including its classification, description, and functional annotations.

The protein target classification is based on the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) classification system, which categorizes proteins into different families and subfamilies based on their sequence similarity and functional properties. The Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2Y6 belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors, which is a large and diverse group of proteins that play important roles in various physiological processes.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It can be used to build predictive models that can identify potential lead compounds for further optimization and development.
