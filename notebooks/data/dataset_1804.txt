The QSAR-TID-143 dataset is categorized under the tags Economics, Life Science, and MTLQSAR. It belongs to the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 143. The activity values are measured in units of pseudo-pCI50. The dataset consists of three hundred ninety-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and a class feature.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

The dataset features include molecule identifiers and median pxc fifty values.
