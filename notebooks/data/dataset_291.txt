This dataset is part of a collection of forty-one drug design datasets. These datasets were created using Adriana.Code software, which can be found at www.molecular-networks.com/software/adrianacode. The molecules and output values were obtained from the original studies mentioned below.

The original studies include Carbolenes, which explores the relationship between chemical structures and their biological activities. Another study is MTP Two, which examines the influence of molecular descriptors on the melting points of solid drugs. Other notable studies include Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two. These studies investigate various aspects of quantitative structure-activity relationships.

Additionally, there are studies on MTP, Benzo Thirty-Two, Phenethyl One, PAH, PDGF-R, Phen, Topo Two-One, YProp Four-One, QSABR One, QSABR Two, QSAR-Tox, QSBR-RW One, QSBR-Y Two, QSBR-Alks, QSFR-DHLA, QSFSR One, and QSFSR Two. These studies cover a range of topics, including quantitative structure-activity relationships, biodegradability, and protein engineering.

Keywords: drug design, quantitative structure-activity relationships, biodegradability, protein engineering, molecular descriptors, melting points, biological activities.
