Name: Analcatdata Negotiation
Tags: mythbusting, study

Source: Unknown - Date unknown

Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Role, Status, Trust, Outcome favorability, Procedural fairness, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Analcatdata Negotiation, is associated with mythbusting and study tags. The original source and date of creation are unknown. It is important to note that this version is a binarized adaptation of an earlier dataset. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset includes several features that appear to be related to negotiation dynamics and outcomes, such as role, status, trust, outcome favorability, and procedural fairness. The final feature, binary class, likely represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.
