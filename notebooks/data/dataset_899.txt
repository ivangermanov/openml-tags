KC1 Software Defect Prediction 

One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect datasets. This dataset contains data from software used for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. The data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the seventies in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Attribute Information:

The dataset includes various attributes such as Line Count of Code, Cyclomatic Complexity, Essential Complexity, Design Complexity, Total Operators plus Operands, Volume, Program Length, Difficulty, Intelligence, Effort, and several others related to Halstead's metrics. 

The dataset also includes the number of Unique Operators, Unique Operands, Total Operators, Total Operands, Branch Count of the Flow Graph, and finally, whether the module has or does not have one or more reported defects.
