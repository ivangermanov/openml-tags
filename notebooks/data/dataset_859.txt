This dataset focuses on analyzing violence in various contexts, potentially including media representations or real-world incidents. The binarization process allows for a simplified classification of instances into positive and negative categories based on a calculated mean value. This transformation may facilitate certain types of statistical analysis or machine learning applications. The features listed provide a range of variables that could be used to study patterns and correlations related to violence and its impacts.
