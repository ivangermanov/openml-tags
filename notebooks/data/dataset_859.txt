This dataset is tagged with Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study, and other related categories. It is a binarized version of the original dataset, where the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature.

In this conversion process, the majority class has been relabeled as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all other classes have been labeled as Negative, denoted by 'N'. 

This dataset consists of various features, including inputs one through sixteen, which have been retained from the original dataset.

The binary class feature has also been preserved in this binarized version.
