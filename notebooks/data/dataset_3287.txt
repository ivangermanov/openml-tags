The goal of this research is to assist auditors by developing a classification model that can predict fraudulent firms based on current and historical risk factors. To achieve this, the researchers examined numerous sectors, including Irrigation, Public Health, Buildings and Roads, Forest, Corporate, Animal Husbandry, Communication, Electrical, Land, Science and Technology, Tourism, Fisheries, Industries, and Agriculture.

The original dataset was divided into two parts: a trial dataset and an audit dataset. These two datasets were later combined into one comprehensive dataset, with two additional features, namely "trial" and "audit", indicating whether the data originated from the trial or audit dataset.

The researchers analyzed various risk factors from different areas, such as past records of the audit office, audit paragraphs, environmental condition reports, firm reputation summaries, ongoing issue reports, profit-value records, loss-value records, and follow-up reports. Following in-depth interviews with auditors, they evaluated the importance of each risk factor and calculated its probability of existence based on current and past records.
