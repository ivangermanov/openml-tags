Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratified argument determines whether the sampling should be stratified or not.

The function starts by getting the unique classes in the dataset and selecting a random subset of them. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to select the corresponding rows and columns from the dataset. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum allowed, it selects a random subset of columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum allowed, it uses the train test split function from scikit learn to select a stratified random subset of rows.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
