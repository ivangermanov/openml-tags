Pathfinder Bayesian Network. Sample Four.

This Bayesian network repository reference is available online.

The network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. It also has an impressive number of parameters, which allows for a high degree of accuracy in modeling real-world systems. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are also notable, indicating a dense network with many connections between nodes.

The Pathfinder project was a pioneering effort in the field of normative expert systems. It aimed to create a system that could reason about uncertainty and make decisions based on incomplete information.

Features of this network include fault diagnosis, symptom evaluation, and disease classification.
