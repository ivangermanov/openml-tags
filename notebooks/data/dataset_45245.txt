Pathfinder Bayesian Network. Sample Four.

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is available online.

This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, making it a complex system. The average Markov blanket size and average degree are moderate, indicating a relatively sparse network. However, the maximum in-degree is relatively high, suggesting that some nodes have a significant number of parents.

The Pathfinder Project is a normative expert system that aims to provide a framework for decision-making under uncertainty. This Bayesian network is part of the project and represents a complex system with many variables and relationships.

Features of this network include Fault, as well as many other variables that are not easily readable.
