Subsampling of the dataset RL with Seed Four Thousand One Hundred Sixty 

This dataset has been generated through a process of subsampling from the original RL dataset, which consisted of Forty Four Thousand One Hundred Sixty samples. The subsampling has been performed using a random number generator with a seed value of four.

The resulting dataset has been limited to a maximum of Two Thousand rows and One Hundred columns. Additionally, the number of classes has been capped at Ten. 

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. Where there were more than Ten unique classes, the selection was made based on the frequency of each class. This ensured that the sampled classes were representative of the original distribution.

Once the classes had been selected, the corresponding rows were extracted from the original dataset. The columns were then uniformly sampled, with the selection being made randomly without replacement. 

If the resulting dataset still exceeded the maximum row limit, a further sampling step was performed using stratified sampling. This ensured that the final dataset retained the same class distribution as the original.

The features of the resulting dataset include various variables, including V One, V Five, V Six, V Eight, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, and V Twenty-Two, as well as the class label.
