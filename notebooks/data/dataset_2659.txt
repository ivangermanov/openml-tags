This is the historical price data of the Forex CHF/SGD currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans a specific date range and does not include weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends.

The timezone of the feature Timestamp is Europe/Amsterdam. The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask prices of the following minute, relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is increasing in the following minute, and false when the mean High price is decreasing or remains the same in the following minute.
