Communities and Crime 

The data set combines socioeconomic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics survey, and crime data from the 1995 Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Report.

Data set characteristics include multivariate attributes, real-valued features, and associated tasks of regression. There are 1994 instances and 128 attributes, with missing values present. This data set falls under the category of social sciences and was donated in 2009.

Many variables are included to test algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes. Clearly unrelated attributes were not included, and attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime, plus the attribute to be predicted, Per Capita Violent Crimes.

Variables included in the data set involve the community, such as the percentage of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and those involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percentage of officers assigned to drug units.

The Per Capita Violent Crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparent controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes, resulting in missing values for rape, which led to incorrect values for Per Capita Violent Crime. These cities are not included in the data set. Many of these omitted communities were from the Midwestern United States.

All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range 0.00-1.00 using an unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew, hence, for example, the population attribute has a mean value of 0.06 because most communities are small.
