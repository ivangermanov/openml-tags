Name: Pharynx (A clinical Trial in the Treatment of Carcinoma of the Oropharynx)

Size: observations, variables

Descriptive Abstract: The data file provides information from a portion of a large clinical trial conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group in the United States. The complete study included patients with squamous carcinoma from multiple sites in the mouth and throat, involving several participating institutions. However, this dataset focuses on three sites in the oropharynx reported by the six largest institutions. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy combined with a chemotherapeutic agent. A primary objective of the study was to compare these two treatment approaches in terms of patient survival.

Variable Descriptions: The data are in free format, with variables separated by blank spaces. Variables include case number, participating institution, sex, treatment type, tumor grade, age at diagnosis, patient condition, tumor site, T staging, N staging, entry date, status, and survival time in days.

Story Behind the Data: Approximately thirty percent of the survival times are censored, primarily due to patients surviving until the time of analysis. Some patients were lost to follow-up due to relocation or transfer to non-participating institutions, though these cases were relatively rare. A significant feature of this dataset is the considerable lack of homogeneity among the individuals studied. While certain eligibility criteria were established to eliminate extreme cases, many factors remained uncontrolled. The study included measurements of several covariates expected to relate to survival experience, such as sex, T staging, N staging, age, general condition, and tumor grade. The site of the primary tumor and potential differences between participating institutions also required consideration.

The T and N staging classification provides a measure of tumor extent at the primary site and regional lymph nodes. General condition assesses the patient's functional capacity at diagnosis, while tumor grade measures the degree of differentiation of the tumor cells. In addition to evaluating the efficacy of combined treatment versus conventional radiation therapy, the study aimed to determine the relationship between these covariates and subsequent survival. Adjusting for potential imbalances in these covariates was crucial in addressing the primary research question.

The analysis of this dataset presents challenges similar to those encountered in classical linear regression and analysis of covariance, with the added complexity of accommodating censored data. The need for nonparametric and robust procedures is emphasized, given the frequent lack of empirical or theoretical support for specific failure time distributions.
