Name: Car Subsample with Two Thousand Rows and Ten Classes Tags: Subsampling of the Car dataset with stratification 

This dataset is a subsample of the original Car dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed ten. The selected classes were then used to filter the data, retaining only the instances that belonged to these classes. 

Furthermore, the columns of the dataset were also uniformly sampled to reduce the number of features to one hundred. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and make it more manageable. 

Finally, the dataset was stratified to ensure that the class distribution was maintained, and the number of rows was limited to two thousand. This stratification was done using a random state to ensure reproducibility. 

The resulting dataset consists of the following features: buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, number of persons, luggage boot size, safety features, and class.
