Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: family, product type, steel, carbon, hardness, temper rolling, condition, formability, strength, non ageing, surface finish, surface quality, enamelability, chrome, phosphorus, carbon bond, experimental, ferrous, corrosion, blue/bright/varnish/clean, luster, shape, thickness, width, length, oil, bore, packing, binary class

This dataset contains information about steel annealing processes and properties. It has been modified from its original multi-class format to a binary classification problem, with the majority class labeled as positive and all other classes combined as negative. The features cover various aspects of steel composition, manufacturing processes, and physical characteristics. This binarized version allows for simplified analysis and modeling of steel properties and manufacturing outcomes.
