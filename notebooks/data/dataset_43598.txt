Global Cause of Deaths Other Than Diseases

This data was part of the project Global Disease Burden. The dataset contains information on the number of deaths within a country and each year, along with the cause of deaths, excluding diseases. The causes of deaths include conflict and terrorism, famine, pandemics, natural disasters, and other injuries.

Description of the Data

The dataset consists of ten columns and numerous rows. Each column provides specific information about the country, including the country name, ISO code, year, total deaths, cause of death, male population, female population, total population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and GDP per capita.

Inspiration
