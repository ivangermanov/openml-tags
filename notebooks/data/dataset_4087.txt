**Electricity**

This dataset belongs to the classification on categorical and numerical features benchmark.

The Electricity dataset is a widely used collection of data described and analyzed by researchers. This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, where prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. To alleviate fluctuations, electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done.

The dataset contains instances dated from May to December. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of thirty minutes, which means there are multiple instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has several fields, including the day of the week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label. The class label identifies the change of the price in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours, removing the impact of longer-term price trends.

Attribute Information:

* Date: a date between May and December, normalized.
* Day: the day of the week.
* Period: the time of the measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours, normalized.
* New South Wales Electricity Price: normalized.
* New South Wales Electricity Demand: normalized.
* Victoria Electricity Price: normalized.
* Victoria Electricity Demand: normalized.
* Scheduled Electricity Transfer: normalized between zero and one.
