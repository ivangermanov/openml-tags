The PC Games 2020 dataset aims to utilize machine learning and chemistry principles to predict the level of success game developers can expect based on their game design details. By analyzing features such as whether the game was developed by an independent studio, whether it has a notable soundtrack, and what genres it belongs to, we can forecast the popularity of the game.

This dataset was compiled in July by scraping the Steam store from most popular to least popular games, which is evident from the correlation between the index and presence values, representing the number of online posts related to each game. During the scraping process, each game's data was supplemented by calling the RAWG API, adding around a dozen more features.

The primary motivation behind creating this dataset is to highlight the significance of each feature in determining game success on the Steam store. This information can be invaluable for game developers, and it would be fascinating to develop a game using these insights to test the accuracy of the models.

The dataset includes features such as Game Name, RAWG ID, Steam URL, Metacritic Score, Game Genres, Independent Studio Indicator, Online Presence, Supported Platforms, Graphics Quality, Storage Requirements, Memory Requirements, Rating Breakdown, Release Date, Notable Soundtrack Indicator, Franchise Status, Original Cost, Discounted Cost, Number of Players, Controller Support, Language Options, ESRB Rating, Achievements, Publisher, Game Description, and Tags.
