The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

These datasets are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation, which includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: the output variable is equal to ten times the sine of pi times the product of two input variables plus twenty times the square of another input variable minus five plus ten times another input variable plus five times yet another input variable plus the error term.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 

These added features are independent from the output; however, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 

The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman datasets' parameters and values are given below: 
the number of features varies, only the first five features are related to the output, the rest are completely random; 
the number of samples varies; 
and colinearity degrees vary. 

For the datasets with high colinearity degree, the number of features is generated accordingly. 

The other datasets have varying number of features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying the number of features, sample size, and colinearity degree. 

The last attribute in each file is the target.
