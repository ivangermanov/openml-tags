The Committee on Statistical Graphics of the American Statistical Association invites participation in its Second Exposition of Statistical Graphics Technology. The Exposition aims to provide a forum for users and providers of statistical graphics technology to exchange information and ideas, and to introduce ASA members less familiar with statistical graphics to its capabilities and potential benefits. The event will be held in conjunction with the Annual Meetings in Toronto and is tentatively scheduled for the afternoon.

Seven providers of statistical graphics technology participated in the previous year's Exposition, which was well received by the ASA community and considered a worthwhile experience for participants. The organizers hope to involve those seven again this year, along with new participants.

The basic format of the Exposition will be similar to the previous year, with some changes based on feedback and experience. Participants are asked to analyze a fixed data set, a version of the CRCARS data set. Due to budget constraints, the data is provided in hardcopy form only. The data set contains observations on variables including miles per gallon, number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, vehicle weight, acceleration time, model year, and origin of car.

Participants are encouraged to use their statistical graphics software to create meaningful displays that highlight relevant aspects of the data. They may use simple graphical formats or showcase more sophisticated capabilities of their software, as long as it remains relevant to the data. Each participant will be provided with a posterboard to display their analyses and is encouraged to remain present during the Exposition to answer viewers' questions.

The ASA emphasizes that the Exposition is intended for educational and scientific purposes and is not a marketing activity. Participants found the previous year's Exposition worthwhile and enjoyable, and the organizers look forward to new participants this year.

The dataset includes features such as name, miles per gallon, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. The class type is nominal, and the class index is the last feature.
