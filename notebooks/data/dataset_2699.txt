This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex Eur/DkK from Dukascopy Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents one candlestick of one minute. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded during these periods. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute represents the direction of the mean of the High Bid and the High Ask of the following minute relative to the High Bid and High Ask mean of the current minute. In other words, the class attribute is true when the mean High price is increasing in the following minute, and false when the mean High price is decreasing or remains unchanged.
