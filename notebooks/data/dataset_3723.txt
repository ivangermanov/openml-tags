QSAR-TID-10747 Tags: Economics, Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10747. It has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for machine learning and data analysis.

The dataset is related to thrombin, a single protein that plays a crucial role in blood coagulation. Thrombin is also known as activation peptide fragment one, activation peptide fragment two, coagulation factor two, and prothrombin.

Thrombin is an enzyme that belongs to the serine protease family and is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, acute phase response, and platelet activation. It is also implicated in different diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.

The dataset provides information about thrombin's structure, function, and interactions, including its relationship with other proteins and molecules. It also includes data about thrombin's role in different cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and migration.
