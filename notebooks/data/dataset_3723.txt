QSAR-TID-10747 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10747. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets.

The drug target, Thrombin, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process. It is also known as Activation Peptide Fragment 1, Activation Peptide Fragment 2, Coagulation Factor II, F2, and Prothrombin.

Thrombin is a serine protease that belongs to the PA clan and S1A subfamily. It is involved in various biological processes, including lipopolysaccharide binding, endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, signaling receptor binding, calcium ion binding, heparin binding, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity.

Thrombin is also involved in various cellular components, including the extracellular region, extracellular space, external side of plasma membrane, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, and serine-type endopeptidase complex.
