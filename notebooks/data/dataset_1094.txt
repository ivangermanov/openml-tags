The dataset illustrates the use of basic statistical methods and has been converted to ARFF format. It was sourced from TunedIT, specifically from the Datasets of Data And Story Library project.

The Acorn dataset explores the relationship between the size of an acorn and the geographic range of the oak tree species. This investigation delves into the intriguing connection between these two factors.

A notable aspect of this dataset is the unique case of the Quercus tomentella Engelm species, which exclusively grows on the Channel Islands and the island of Guadalupe, covering a total area of one thousand and fourteen square kilometers and two hundred and sixty-five square kilometers respectively. In contrast, all other species are found on the Continental United States.

This dataset comprises thirty-nine cases, each featuring five variables: the Latin name of the species, the region in which it is found (either Atlantic or California), the geographic area covered by the species, the size of the acorn in cubic centimeters, and the height of the tree in meters.
