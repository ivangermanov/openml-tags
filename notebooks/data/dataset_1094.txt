This dataset, known as Acorns, is part of the Data And Story Library project, which illustrates the use of basic statistical methods. The data was converted to arff format and is available through TunedIT repository and the DASL file system. The original source and date of collection are unknown.

The dataset focuses on the relationship between acorn size and the geographic range of oak tree species. It includes data from both the Atlantic and California regions, with a notable exception being the Quercus tomentella Engelm species, which grows only on the Channel Islands and the island of Guadalupe, rather than the Continental United States like the other species in the study.

The dataset comprises multiple variables for each oak species, including the Latin name of the species, the region where it grows (Atlantic or California), its geographic range in square kilometers, acorn size in cubic centimeters, and tree height in meters. These variables allow for the exploration of potential correlations between acorn size and the distribution of oak trees across different geographic areas.

This ecological dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying plant biology, biogeography, and environmental science. It offers insights into how tree characteristics may relate to their geographic distribution, which could have implications for understanding plant adaptation and evolution.
