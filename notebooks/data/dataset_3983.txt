QSAR-TID-10545 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10545. It has twenty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The dataset shows activity values in units of pseudo-pCI fifty of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero five four five. It provides a comprehensive set of features representing the molecular structure of these compounds.

These features are essential for understanding the relationship between the molecular structure of these compounds and their activity on the drug target. By analyzing these features, researchers can identify patterns and correlations that can inform the design of new compounds with improved activity.

The dataset is an essential resource for researchers working on the development of new drugs targeting TID: one zero five four five.
