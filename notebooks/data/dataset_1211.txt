AutoUniv Dataset 

Abstract:
The AutoUniv dataset is an advanced data generator for classification tasks, aimed at reflecting the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. This dataset can be generated in various formats, including CSV, ARFF, or C4.5.

Data Set Information:
To create a model, users specify the number of attributes and their type, the number of classes, the complexity of the underlying rules, and the noise level. Then, AutoUniv produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have multiple rules, and rare class models can be designed. Additionally, a sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift.

Attribute Information:
Attributes can be either discrete or continuous. Discrete attributes can be nominal or integer, with varying values.

Relevant Papers:
Modeling the example life cycle in an online classification learner, and the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift are some relevant research topics related to this dataset.
