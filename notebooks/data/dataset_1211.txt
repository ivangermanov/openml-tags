The BNG (SPECT) dataset is an artificial collection of data related to Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging. This study focuses on various features extracted from SPECT images, including an overall diagnosis and multiple individual factors denoted as F. These features likely represent different aspects or measurements obtained from the SPECT scans, which are commonly used in medical imaging for diagnostic purposes. The artificial nature of the dataset suggests it may be used for research, training, or testing purposes in the field of medical image analysis or machine learning applications in healthcare.
