This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TGF-beta receptor type one, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id and many other molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

The TGF-beta receptor type one is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes including skeletal system development, angiogenesis, kidney development, and heart development.

It is also involved in regulating cellular responses to growth factors, apoptosis, and cell migration.

The receptor is activated upon binding to its ligands, leading to the phosphorylation of smad proteins, which then regulate gene transcription.

Abnormalities in this pathway have been implicated in various diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and fibrosis.

The TGF-beta receptor type one has been targeted for therapeutic intervention, with multiple small molecules being developed as inhibitors of this receptor.

These inhibitors have shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of various diseases.

Understanding the structure-activity relationships of these inhibitors is crucial for the design of more potent and selective compounds.
