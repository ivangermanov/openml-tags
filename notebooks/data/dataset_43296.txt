Cause-effect is a growing database of two-variable cause-effect pairs created at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in TÃ¼bingen, Germany.

Some pairs are high-dimensional, and for machine readability, the relevant information about this is coded in metadata. The metadata contains the following information: number of pair, first column of cause, last column of cause, first column of effect, last column of effect, and dataset weight. The dataset weight should be used for calculating average performance of causal inference methods to avoid a bias introduced by having multiple copies of essentially the same data.

When using this dataset in a publication, please cite the paper that contains much more detailed information regarding this dataset in the supplement.

The dataset includes pairs taken from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Overview of all data pairs:

Variable one, Variable two, Dataset, Ground Truth

Pair two: Altitude, Precipitation, Deutscher Wetterdienst, Altitude causes Precipitation

Information for Pair two: The Deutscher Wetterdienst data was taken at three hundred forty-nine stations. The data was taken from the Deutscher Wetterdienst website, which provides climate and weather data for Germany. The data includes yearly values averaged over the period from nineteen sixty-one to nineteen ninety.
