The Meta-Album Insects Dataset (Micro) is a comprehensive collection of images featuring various insects in their natural environments. This dataset was originally created by the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and consists of over 290,000 images in different sizes and orientations. The images were carefully curated and contributed by researchers and volunteers from the SPIPOLL Science project.

Each image in the dataset showcases an insect amidst flowers or near vegetation, providing a unique glimpse into their habitats. The images were uploaded to a centralized server through the SPIPOLL website, Android application, or iOS application.

The preprocessed insect dataset was prepared by cropping the original images to create square shapes and resizing them to 128x128 pixels using Open-CV with an anti-aliasing filter.
