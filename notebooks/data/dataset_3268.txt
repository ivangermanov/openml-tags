QSAR-TID-10461 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10461. The dataset has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10461. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is available for download and can be used for QSAR modeling and other machine learning applications.

The dataset contains information about the Ecdysone receptor, which is a single protein target. The Ecdysone receptor is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to ecdysone, a hormone that controls molting and metamorphosis in insects. The receptor is a nuclear hormone receptor that binds to ecdysone and other ligands, leading to changes in gene expression.

The dataset provides information about the Ecdysone receptor, including its synonyms, such as twenty-E receptor, twenty-hydroxy-ecdysone receptor, AaEcR, and Ecdysteroid receptor. The dataset also provides information about the receptor's classification, including its membership in the nuclear hormone receptor subfamily one group H.

The dataset contains information about the Ecdysone receptor's function, including its role in regulating DNA-templated transcription and its involvement in the ecdysone receptor-mediated signaling pathway. The dataset also provides information about the receptor's cellular component, including its location in the nucleus.
