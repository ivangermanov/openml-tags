QSAR-TID-12243 Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Manufacturing, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12243. It has twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

The dataset was scraped from various sources including ChEMBL, Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, InterPro, Pfam, Reactome, and UniProt.

The drug target is Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, also known as Ace, which is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. It is primarily expressed in the lungs and kidneys and is responsible for converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.

The Gene Ontology terms associated with this target include extracellular region, cytoplasm, lysosome, endosome, plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, basal plasma membrane, membrane, brush border membrane, vesicle, and many others.

The target is involved in various biological processes, including response to hypoxia, kidney development, angiotensin maturation, neutrophil mediated immunity, regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, proteolysis, peptide metabolic process, spermatogenesis, female pregnancy, and many others.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, molecular fingerprints, Gene Ontology, biological processes.
