QSAR-TID-12243 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12243. The dataset has twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, also known as Ace. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme is a single protein, and its preferred name is Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme. It has several synonyms, including Ace, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme soluble form, and CD antigen equals CD one hundred forty-three.

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme is an enzyme that belongs to the metallo protease M two family. It is involved in various biological processes, including response to hypoxia, kidney development, angiotensin maturation, neutrophil mediated immunity, and regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by renin-angiotensin.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project provides a large collection of QSAR datasets, which can be used for developing and evaluating QSAR models.
