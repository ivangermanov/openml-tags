Miami Housing 2016 
Tags: Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark 

This dataset belongs to the Regression on Numerical Features benchmark. 

The dataset contains comprehensive information about thirteen thousand single-family homes sold in Miami during the year 2016. In addition to publicly available details, the dataset includes calculated distance variables, aviation noise levels, as well as geographical coordinates such as latitude and longitude.

Each entry in the dataset represents a unique property, identified by a parcel number. Approximately one percent of these properties have multiple entries.

The dataset comprises various attributes, including:

Sale Price, which denotes the amount paid for the property in dollars;

Land Area, measured in square feet;

Total Living Area, also measured in square feet;

Value of Special Features, which encompasses amenities such as swimming pools, expressed in dollars;

Distance to the Nearest Rail Line, which serves as an indicator of noise levels, measured in feet;

Ocean Distance, measured in feet;

Water Distance, which indicates proximity to the nearest body of water, measured in feet;

Central Business District Distance, measured in feet;

Sub-center Distance, measured in feet;

Highway Distance, another indicator of noise levels, measured in feet;

Age of the Structure;

Aviation Noise Exceeding Acceptable Levels, denoted by a binary variable;

Quality of the Structure;

Month Sold, representing the month of sale within the calendar year 2016; 

Latitude and Longitude geographic coordinates.

A typical predictive model would aim to forecast the logarithmic Sale Price based on all variables excluding the Parcel Number.
