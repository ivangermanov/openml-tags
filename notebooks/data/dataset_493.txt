Please cite: These data are estimated correlations between daily afternoon wind measurements during September and October for a network of stations in the Sydney region. The first column provides a list of station latitudes, the second gives a list of station longitudes, and the remaining columns give the spatial correlation matrix of the station measurements.

Further details about the data are contained in a technical report titled "Analysis of Spatial Covariance Structure from Monitoring Data" from the Department of Statistics at the University of New South Wales. For questions or to obtain the latest version of the report, please contact the department via email.

Information about the dataset:
Class Type: Numeric
Class Index: None specific
Features: The dataset includes latitude, longitude, and correlation measurements for multiple stations in the Sydney area.

This dataset provides valuable information on wind patterns and correlations across various locations in the Sydney region. The spatial correlation matrix allows for analysis of wind behavior and relationships between different monitoring stations. Researchers and meteorologists can utilize this data to study local wind patterns, potentially aiding in weather forecasting and climate studies for the area.
