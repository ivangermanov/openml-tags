This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101610, and it has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the serine/threonine-protein kinase PLK2, also known as polo-like kinase 2, which is a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis.

The dataset includes multiple features that describe the molecular properties of the compounds, such as their chemical structure, physicochemical properties, and biological activity. These features can be used to build predictive models of biological activity, allowing researchers to identify potential lead compounds for further optimization and development.

The dataset also includes information about the protein target, including its synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. Additionally, it provides links to external resources, such as Expression Atlas, Go Component, Go Function, and Go Process, which offer additional information about the protein target and its biological functions.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, drug target, serine/threonine-protein kinase, polo-like kinase 2, molecular fingerprints, predictive modeling, biological activity.
