This is the Multipurpose World News Dataset, tagged under Computer Systems and Machine Learning. 

I began constructing this dataset for my forthcoming personal projects because I believe that acquiring this type of data for free and within a short span of time is quite challenging. 

Starting from March, I initiated the process of collecting news data from various reputable sources including Fox Business, YouTube, CNET, The Verge, New York Times, Raw Story, Investor's Business Daily, WREG, Reuters, KOIN, Inc., CNBC, NJ, WMTP, NBC DFW, Bloomberg, WOWT, and BBC.

For every twenty-minute interval, a script checks for novel headlines on these sources and adds them to a comprehensive database. This comma-separated values file is generated from that database.

My intention is to update this dataset daily, provided the machine running this script remains operational.

The dataset comprises essential features including a unique identifier, timestamp, news source, headline title, and a brief description.
