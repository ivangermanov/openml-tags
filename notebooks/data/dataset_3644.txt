QSAR-TID-101610 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101610. The dataset has 145 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the serine/threonine-protein kinase PLK2 target.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase PLK2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis. It is a potential drug target for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for the serine/threonine-protein kinase PLK2 target.
