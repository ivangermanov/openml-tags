**Meta Album Medicinal Leaf Dataset (Mini)**

The Medicinal Leaf Database gathers thirty species of healthy and mature medicinal herbs. The leaves are plucked from different plants of the same species, then placed on a white uniform background. The images are captured with a mobile phone camera. We create Medleaf for Meta Album by cropping them at the center and resizing to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels.
