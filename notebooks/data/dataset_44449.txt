Name: Subsample of the RL Dataset with One Seed and Two Thousand Rows

Tags: Subsampling of the RL dataset with a seed of one, two thousand rows, one hundred columns, ten classes, and stratification enabled.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses a random number generator to select the classes, columns, and rows. If the number of classes in the dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the rows where one of these classes is present. If the number of columns in the dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it selects the columns uniformly at random. Finally, if the number of rows in the dataset is greater than the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows.

The function returns a new dataset with the selected rows, columns, and classes. It also includes a categorical mask, which is a list of boolean values indicating whether each column is categorical.

Features: The dataset includes a class feature and several other features, including V Five, V Six, V Eight, V Fourteen, V Fifteen, V Seventeen, V Eighteen, V Nineteen, V Twenty, V Twenty-One, and V Twenty-Two.

Keywords: dataset subsampling, stratified sampling, random number generator, categorical mask, class feature.
