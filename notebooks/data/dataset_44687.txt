Subsampling of the dataset Christine with seed equals four, maximum number of rows equals two thousand, maximum number of columns equals one hundred, maximum number of classes equals ten, and stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset with a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. It uses numpy's random default generator to select the classes, columns, and rows. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the dataset. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects the columns randomly. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows.

The function returns a new dataset with the selected rows, columns, and classes. It also converts categorical columns to string for OpenML.
