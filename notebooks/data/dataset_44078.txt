Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

Original Description:

The dataset consists of several assignments. Each assignment consists of a question followed by ten sentences (titles of news articles). One of the sentences is the correct answer to the question (Correct) and five of the sentences are irrelevant to the question (Irrelevant). Four of the sentences are relevant to the question (Relevant), but they do not answer it.

Features are in columns, feature vectors in rows. Each assignment is a time sequence of twenty-two dimensional feature vectors. The first column is the line number, the second column is the assignment number, and the next twenty-two columns are the different features. Columns twenty-five to twenty-seven contain extra information about the example. The training data set contains the classification label in the twenty-eighth column: "zero" for Irrelevant, "one" for Relevant, and "two" for Correct. Each example (row) represents a single word. You are asked to return the classification of each read sentence.

The twenty-two features provided are commonly used in psychological studies on eye movement. Not all of them are necessarily relevant in this context. The objective of the challenge is to predict the classification labels (Irrelevant, Relevant, Correct).
