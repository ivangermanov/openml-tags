**Student Performance in Portuguese**

This dataset approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language. 

Important note: the target attribute Final Grade has a strong correlation with attributes First Period Grade and Second Period Grade. This occurs because Final Grade is the final year grade, while First Period Grade and Second Period Grade correspond to the first and second period grades. It is more difficult to predict Final Grade without First Period Grade and Second Period Grade, but such prediction is much more useful.

The attributes include student's school, student's sex, student's age, student's home address type, family size, parent's cohabitation status, mother's education, father's education, mother's job, father's job, reason to choose this school, student's guardian, home to school travel time, weekly study time, number of past class failures, extra educational support, family educational support, extra paid classes within the course subject, extra-curricular activities, attended nursery school, wants to take higher education, Internet access at home, with a romantic relationship, quality of family relationships, free time after school, going out with friends, workday alcohol consumption, weekend alcohol consumption, current health status, and number of school absences.
