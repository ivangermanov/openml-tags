The Dilbert dataset has been subsampled with a specific set of parameters to create a new dataset. This dataset has been generated using a particular source code, which involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The subsampling process begins by selecting a specified number of unique classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of classes is made based on their value counts. The indices where these selected classes are present are then used to filter the data.

Next, the columns are uniformly sampled to reduce the total number of columns to a specified maximum. A random selection of column indices is made, and the corresponding columns are selected from the filtered data.

Finally, the rows are sampled to reduce the total number of rows to a specified maximum. A stratified split is performed to ensure that the class distribution is maintained in the subsampled data.

The resulting dataset consists of the filtered data, along with the corresponding categorical mask, columns, and other metadata.

Features: Various numerical features have been included in this dataset, representing different aspects of the data.
