This dataset is a subsampling of the Segment dataset with a seed of zero. The subsampling function takes several arguments, including the number of rows, number of columns, and number of classes, as well as a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling. In this case, the function was called with a maximum of two thousand rows, one hundred columns, ten classes, and stratification turned on.

The subsampling process begins by uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If there are more than ten unique classes, the function selects ten classes using a weighted random choice based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses them to subset the data.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset. If there are more than one hundred columns, it chooses one hundred columns at random and uses them to subset the data. Finally, if the resulting dataset has more than two thousand rows, it uses stratified sampling to reduce the number of rows to two thousand.
