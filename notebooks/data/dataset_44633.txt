Segment Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

This is a subsampling of the dataset segment with a seed of zero, where the maximum number of rows is two thousand, the maximum number of columns is one hundred, and the maximum number of classes is ten. The stratify argument is set to true.

The subsample function takes in several arguments, including the seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the unique values in the target variable, and then selects the indices where one of these classes is present. It then uniformly samples columns if required, and finally stratifies the data accordingly.

The resulting dataset has a subset of the original features, including short line density, vegetation edge mean, vegetation edge standard deviation, hedge mean, hedge standard deviation, intensity mean, raw red mean, raw blue mean, raw green mean, excess red mean, excess blue mean, excess green mean, value mean, saturation mean, and hue mean.
