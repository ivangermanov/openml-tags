This dataset contains historical price data of the Forex Eur/Pln currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents a one-minute candlestick, and the entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth, excluding weekends since the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent minute compared to the mean high price in the current minute. Specifically, the class attribute is true if the mean high price increases in the following minute, and false if it decreases or remains unchanged.

Please note that this task is hypothetical and intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
