QSAR-TID-11902 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11902. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1211 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Nerve Growth Factor Receptor Trk-A is a single protein, also known as gp140trk, High Affinity Nerve Growth Factor Receptor, Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 1, NTRK1, and p140-TrkA. It is a protein target classification of 1. Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Trk family.

The dataset is related to Homo sapiens species group, and the protein target classification is 1. Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Trk family.

The dataset contains information about the protein, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also contains information about the protein's relationships, including its accession, preferred name, target type, and mechanism of action.

The dataset also contains information about the protein's expression, including its expression atlas, go component, go function, and go process. It also contains information about the protein's interactions, including its protein-protein interactions and protein-ligand interactions.
