QSAR-TID-11902 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11902. It has 1211 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

This dataset provides information about the Nerve Growth Factor Receptor Trk-A, also known as gp140trk or High Affinity Nerve Growth Factor Receptor. It is a single protein receptor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including nervous system development, neuronal survival, and axon guidance.

The receptor is involved in multiple cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and positive regulation of protein phosphorylation. It also interacts with various proteins, such as neurotrophins, to regulate cellular responses.

The dataset includes information about the receptor's structure, function, and interactions, as well as its role in different diseases and disorders, such as cancer, neurological disorders, and pain insensitivity.
