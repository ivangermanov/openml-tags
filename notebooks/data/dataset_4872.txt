The original MNIST image dataset of handwritten digits is a popular benchmark for image-based machine learning methods, but researchers have renewed efforts to update it and develop drop-in replacements that are more challenging for computer vision and original for real-world applications.

SignMNIST is a dataset formatted to match closely with the classic MNIST. Each training and test case represents a label as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter from A to Z, excluding cases for J and Z due to gesture motions. 

The training data and test data are approximately half the size of the standard MNIST but otherwise similar, with a header row of label and pixels that represent a single twenty-eight by twenty-eight pixel image with grayscale values ranging from zero to two hundred fifty-five. 

The train and test data have been concatenated and can be retrieved by selecting the relevant rows for train and test.

Features include the label and pixels of the image.
