QSAR-TID-10839 Dataset: Life Science, MTLQSAR, Social Media, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10839. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling.

The target protein, Serine Threonine Protein Kinase PIM One, is a single protein that belongs to the CAMK protein kinase group and CAMK protein kinase PIM family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, and apoptosis.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and membrane. It has multiple functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, transcription factor binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, manganese ion binding, ribosomal small subunit binding, and metal ion binding.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, cell cycle, apoptosis, regulation of transmembrane transporter activity, negative regulation of apoptotic process, negative regulation of DNA binding transcription factor activity, positive regulation of cyclin dependent protein serine threonine kinase activity, positive regulation of DNA templated transcription, protein autophosphorylation, protein stabilization, positive regulation of cardiac muscle cell proliferation, vitamin D receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of protein serine threonine kinase activity, positive regulation of brown fat cell differentiation, regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, positive regulation of cardioblast proliferation, and cellular detoxification.
