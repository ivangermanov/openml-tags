QSAR-TID-10839 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10839. The dataset has 1891 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and includes activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a set of numerical values. These fingerprints can be used to predict the activity of compounds against a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a valuable resource for identifying potential lead compounds and optimizing their activity.
