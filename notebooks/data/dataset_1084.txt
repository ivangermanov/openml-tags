This dataset contains several samples, characterized by values of numerous attributes. These samples are assigned to multiple classes. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA microarrays. The attributes are normalized in some way, resulting in similar distributions of attribute values throughout the dataset.

The dataset originated from the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge. The challenge provided datasets containing various numbers of samples, ranging from one hundred to four hundred, each described by a large number of attributes, spanning from twenty thousand to sixty-five thousand. 

Samples in the dataset are categorized into multiple classes, varying from two to ten classes per sample set. 

Features include variables one through one hundred, among many others.
