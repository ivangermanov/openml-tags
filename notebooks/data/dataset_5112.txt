Timing Attack Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science 

Bleichenbacher Timing Attack dataset was created to study the vulnerability of cryptographic systems to timing attacks. This dataset contains twenty microsecond delay data collected on September eighth, two thousand twenty-two.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset includes attributes related to three types of packets: Change Cipher Spec packets, TLS Alerts, and TCP Disconnects. For each type of packet, the attributes include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp tsval, time delta, and order.

The Change Cipher Spec packets have attributes including source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp tsval, time delta, and order.

The TLS Alerts have attributes including source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp tsval, time delta, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and order.

The TCP Disconnects have attributes including source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options nop, option kind, option length, timestamp tsval, time delta, and order.
