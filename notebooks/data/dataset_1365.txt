The QSAR-TID-30024 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30024. This dataset has eighty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the source when using this dataset. The dataset is related to chemistry, machine learning, and multi-task learning QSAR, and it belongs to the study three category.

The target protein is Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase MST One, also known as KRS Two, Mammalian STE Twenty-Like Protein Kinase One, MST One, MST-One, MST-One-C. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens, and its classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase STE protein kinase group STE protein kinase STE Twenty family STE protein kinase MST subfamily.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell morphogenesis, branching involved in blood vessel morphogenesis, neural tube formation, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, and endocardium development. It is also involved in protein phosphorylation, protein import into nucleus, apoptotic process, signal transduction, central nervous system development, cell population proliferation, and negative regulation of cell population proliferation.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, machine learning, multi-task learning, Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase MST One, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, apoptotic process.
