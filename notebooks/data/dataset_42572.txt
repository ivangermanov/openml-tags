According to research, eighty percent of customers are more likely to do business with a company if it provides personalized service. Banking is no exception. The digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner, often before they have even realized they need the service. 

In their third competition, Santander Group aims to go a step beyond recognizing that there is a need to provide a customer a financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before.
