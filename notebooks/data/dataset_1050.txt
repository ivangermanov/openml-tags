The PC3 dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, specifically focusing on software defect prediction. This dataset originates from flight software for an earth-orbiting satellite and comprises features extracted from source code using McCabe and Halstead feature extractors. These features were initially defined in the seventies to objectively characterize code attributes associated with software quality.

The dataset contains various features, including lines of blank code, branch count, call pairs, lines of code and comments, lines of comments, condition count, cyclomatic complexity, design complexity, edge count, essential complexity, halstead content, maintenance severity, modified condition count, multiple condition count, node count, number of lines, percent comments, and total lines of code.

Several studies have utilized this dataset to assess predictors of software defects, examining the effectiveness of blind spot sampling policies and evaluating data quality. Researchers have also employed this dataset to investigate the relationship between software metrics and defect density.
