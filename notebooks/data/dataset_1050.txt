This dataset is one of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets, containing information from flight software for an earth orbiting satellite. The data was extracted using McCabe and Halstead feature extractors applied to source code. These features were developed in the s in an attempt to objectively characterize code attributes associated with software quality.

The dataset focuses on software defect prediction, utilizing various metrics to analyze and predict potential defects in the code. It incorporates a wide range of features, including lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics, and other code-related measurements. These metrics provide insights into the structure, complexity, and potential issues within the software.

Relevant research has been conducted using this dataset, exploring topics such as data quality in software defect datasets, blind spot sampling policies in software engineering, and the assessment of software defect predictors. These studies have contributed to the field of software quality assurance and defect prediction methodologies.

The features included in the dataset cover various aspects of code analysis, such as blank lines, branch counts, code and comment ratios, complexity measures, and numerous Halstead metrics. These attributes allow researchers and practitioners to gain a comprehensive understanding of the codebase and its potential vulnerabilities.

By providing this rich set of metrics, the PC Software Defect Prediction dataset enables researchers to develop and evaluate models for identifying potential defects in software systems. This contributes to the ongoing efforts in improving software quality and reliability in critical applications like satellite flight software.
