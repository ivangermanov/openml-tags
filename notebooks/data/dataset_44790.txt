KDD Cup 09 Upselling Seed 2 Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampling of the KDD Cup 09 Upselling dataset with a seed value of two. It belongs to the categories of Agriculture and Life Science.

The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset. The number of classes was capped at ten. The classes were chosen based on their frequency of occurrence, with more frequent classes having a higher chance of being selected.

Once the classes were selected, the corresponding rows from the original dataset were retained. The remaining rows were discarded.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled. The maximum number of columns was set at one hundred. The columns were chosen randomly without replacement.

If the resulting dataset had more than two thousand rows, stratification was applied to ensure that the class distribution remained consistent. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using stratified sampling.

The resulting dataset contains only the selected columns and rows. The categorical columns have been converted to strings to facilitate processing.

Features: Various agricultural and life science related variables.
