Please cite: Dataset created to study concept drift in stream mining. It is constructed by combining the Covertype, Poker Hand, and Electricity datasets. More details can be found in the proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining.

This dataset was specifically designed to investigate the phenomenon of concept drift in the field of stream mining. It amalgamates data from three distinct sources: Covertype, which likely contains information about forest cover types; Poker Hand, which presumably includes data related to poker game scenarios; and Electricity, which may contain information about electricity consumption or pricing.

The combination of these diverse datasets allows researchers to simulate and analyze how machine learning models perform when faced with evolving data patterns over time. This is particularly relevant in real-world applications where the underlying relationships between variables may change, requiring adaptive learning algorithms.

The features of this dataset encompass a wide range of attributes, including geographical information such as elevation, aspect, slope, and distances to various landmarks. It also includes environmental factors like hillshade at different times of day, wilderness area designations, and numerous soil type classifications. Additionally, there appear to be time-related features and electricity market indicators, though the exact nature of some features is not fully clear from their labels alone.

This comprehensive dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of data mining and machine learning, particularly those focused on developing and testing algorithms capable of handling concept drift in streaming data environments.
