Dataset created to study concept drift in stream mining. This dataset is constructed by combining the Cover Type, Poker Hand, and Electricity datasets. The goal is to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how machine learning models adapt to changing data distributions over time.

The dataset comprises various features, including elevation, aspect, slope, horizontal distance to hydrology, vertical distance to hydrology, horizontal distance to roadways, hill shade at different times of the day, horizontal distance to fire points, wilderness area classification, soil type classification, and several other attributes related to poker hand and electricity consumption.

This dataset is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners working on developing new ensemble methods for evolving data streams.
