QSAR-TID-124 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor 1, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor 1. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Corticotropin Releasing Factor Receptor 1 is a single protein, also known as Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor 1, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor 1, CRFR, CRFR1, CRF-R1. It is a membrane receptor, specifically a Family B G protein-coupled receptor, and a Peptide receptor. It is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including immune response, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
