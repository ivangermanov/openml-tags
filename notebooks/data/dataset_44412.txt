Name: MiniBooNE Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset MiniBooNE with seed equal to zero, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset. It takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a subsampled dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes in the dataset. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, it uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is more than the maximum allowed, it selects a random subset of columns.

If the number of rows is more than the maximum allowed, it stratifies the data accordingly. It concatenates the data and target, splits it into a subset, and then separates the data and target again.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns the subsampled dataset.
