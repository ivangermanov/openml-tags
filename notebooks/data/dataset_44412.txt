Mini BooNe Seed Zero N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Cols One Hundred Stratify True

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Mini BooNe dataset. The sampling was done using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value of zero, a maximum number of rows of two thousand, a maximum number of columns of one hundred, and a maximum number of classes of ten. Additionally, the sampling was done in a stratified manner.

The original dataset was reduced in size by uniformly sampling classes until the desired number of classes was reached. Then, the columns were uniformly sampled until the desired number of columns was reached. Finally, the rows were sampled in a stratified manner to ensure that the class distribution was maintained.

The resulting dataset has a specific set of features, although they are not easily interpretable due to their technical nature.
