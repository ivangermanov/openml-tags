The dataset, IEEE 80211 AA GATS NS, tagged with Machine Learning and Meteorology, displays the downlink goodput for both unicast and multicast transmissions under varying group sizes and network loads within an IEEE 802.11ac network simulated using NS-3. The dataset explores the performance of different IEEE 802.11aa Group Address Translation Services (GATS).

It examines the effects of different multicast modes, the number of multicast stations, and the number of unicast stations on network performance. Additionally, it investigates the impact of injected multicast traffic, injected unicast traffic, and network occupancy on downlink goodput.

The dataset provides insights into various performance metrics, including average data rate, delay, and goodput for both downlink and uplink transmissions. It also explores the retransmission share for downlink and uplink traffic.
