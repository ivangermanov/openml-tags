Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2

Tags: Machine Learning, Medicine

Weekly carbon dioxide concentration averages derived from continuous air samples for the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, United States.

These weekly averages are ultimately based on measurements of four air samples per hour taken atop intake lines on several towers during steady periods of carbon dioxide concentration of not less than six hours per day. If no such periods are available on a given day, then no data are used for that day. The Weight column gives the number of days used in each weekly average. Flag codes are explained in the National Data Program write-up, available electronically from the home page of this data set.

Carbon dioxide concentrations are in terms of the nineteen ninety-nine calibration scale, available electronically from the references in the National Data Program write-up, which can be accessed from the home page of this data set.
