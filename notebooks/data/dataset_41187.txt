Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2

Tags: Weekly carbon dioxide concentration averages derived from continuous air samples for the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, U.S.A.

These weekly averages are ultimately based on measurements of air samples taken atop intake lines on several towers during steady periods of carbon dioxide concentration of not less than six hours per day. If no such periods are available on a given day, then no data are used for that day. The weight column gives the number of days used in each weekly average. Flag codes are explained in the NDP write-up, available electronically from the home page of this data set.

Carbon dioxide concentrations are in terms of the calibration scale available electronically from the references in the NDP write-up, which can be accessed from the home page of this data set.

### Feature Descriptions

Carbon dioxide concentration is the average concentration in parts per million by volume. The year, month, and day of concentration measurement are also included. The weight feature represents the number of days used in each weekly average. The flag feature represents the flag code, and the station feature represents the station code.

### Data Source

The data is sourced from the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, U.S.A.
