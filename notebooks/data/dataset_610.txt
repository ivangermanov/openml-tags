The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets. The dataset names are coded as "fri colinearintydegree samplenumber featurenumber". Friedman is one of the most used functions for data generation. Friedman functions include both linear and non linear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. The Friedman function is as follows: y equals ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus point five squared equals ten multiplied by X four plus five multiplied by X five plus e.

In the original Friedman function, there are features for input. To measure the effects of non related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to the colinearity, the datasets are generated with different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degrees is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:
The number of features: only the first features are related to the output. The rest are completely random
The number of samples: various amounts
Colinearity degrees: various degrees

For the datasets with colinearity degree, the numbers of features are generated as various amounts. The other datasets have various feature amounts. As a result, artificial datasets are generated by different feature numbers multiplied by different sample numbers multiplied by different colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target. Features include numerous "oz" variables.
