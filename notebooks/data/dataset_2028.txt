MetaQSAR Project 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. 

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and many other molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset was generated from ChEMBL version seventeen.

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Alpha one d adrenergic receptor, which belongs to single protein family and is classified under membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor small molecule receptor family monoamine receptor adrenergic receptor. It is primarily found in Homo sapiens species group.
