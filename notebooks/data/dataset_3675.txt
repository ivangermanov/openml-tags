Cloud Dataset

Data from StatLib 

These data were collected during a cloud seeding experiment conducted in Tasmania between mid nineteen sixty four and January nineteen seventy one. The analysis of these data, which employed regression techniques and permutation tests, is extensively discussed in a research paper titled Analyzing the Results of a Cloud Seeding Experiment in Tasmania. This rainfall data represents period rainfall measured in inches. Two specific target areas, referred to as the East Target Area and the West Target Area, are denoted by TE and TW respectively, while three control areas, namely the North Control Area, the South Control Area, and the North-West Control Area, are represented by NC, SC, and NWC respectively. Furthermore, two distinct conditions, Seeded and Unseeded, are denoted by S and U respectively. Notably, rainfall in the Eastern Target Region serves as the class attribute. The attribute related to rainfall in the Western Target Region has been deliberately excluded.
