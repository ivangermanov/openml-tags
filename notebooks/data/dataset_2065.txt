QSAR-TID-10283 Dataset Description:

The QSAR-TID-10283 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 10283. This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was generated in September 2015.

Demographics:
This dataset consists of seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including identifiers and class features. The features represent fingerprints of molecules, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Features:
The features in this dataset include molecular identifiers, fingerprints, and activity values. The fingerprints are binary vectors representing the presence or absence of specific substructures in the molecules. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Study Description:
This study focuses on the beta-two adrenergic receptor, a single protein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. It is primarily located in the nucleus, endosome, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, caveola, and other cellular components.

Target Classification:
The beta-two adrenergic receptor belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, specifically the monoamine receptor/adrenergic receptor group. It is responsible for responding to signals mediated by norepinephrine and epinephrine.

Description:
This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, diet-induced thermogenesis, desensitization of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and smooth muscle contraction. It also participates in signal transduction, adenylate cyclase activation, and protein kinase A signaling.

Keywords: QSAR, beta-two adrenergic receptor, G protein-coupled receptor, monoamine receptor, adrenergic receptor, signal transduction, adenylate cyclase activation, protein kinase A signaling.
