QSAR Bioconcentration Classes Data Set 

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

Data Set Information: 
A dataset of manually curated bioconcentration factors for seven hundred seventy-nine chemicals was used to determine the mechanisms of bioconcentration, specifically to predict whether a chemical is mainly stored within lipid tissues, has additional storage sites such as proteins, or is metabolized or eliminated. 

Data were randomly split into a training set and a test set, preserving the proportion between the classes. Two quantitative structure-activity relationship classification trees were developed using the Classification and Regression Trees machine learning technique coupled with Genetic Algorithms.

The file contains the selected molecular descriptors along with compound identifiers, experimental bioconcentration factor, experimental and predicted octanol-water partition coefficient, and mechanistic class.

Attribute Information:
Compound identifiers consist of Chemical Abstracts Service number and Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System. 
Training and testing data are split accordingly.
Nine molecular descriptors are independent variables.
Two experimental responses include bioconcentration factor in logarithmic units for regression and bioaccumulation class categorized into three classes.
