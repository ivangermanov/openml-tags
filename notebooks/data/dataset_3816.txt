QSAR-TID-12567 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12567. It has nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.
