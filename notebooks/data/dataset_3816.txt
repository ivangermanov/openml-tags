QSAR-TID-12567 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12567. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The drug target, Cytochrome P450 1A1, is a single protein that belongs to the enzyme/cytochrome P450/cytochrome P450 family 1/cytochrome P450 family 1A/cytochrome P450 1A1 classification. It is found in the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, mitochondrial inner membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

Cytochrome P450 1A1 has various functions, including catalytic activity, monooxygenase activity, iron ion binding, protein binding, arachidonic acid monooxygenase activity, steroid hydroxylase activity, oxidoreductase activity, and lyase activity.

It is involved in various biological processes, including response to hypoxia, long-chain fatty acid metabolic process, lipid hydroxylation, lipid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process, steroid biosynthetic process, porphyrin-containing compound metabolic process, xenobiotic metabolic process, and steroid metabolic process.
