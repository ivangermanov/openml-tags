Diabetes One Thirty US Seed Four Dataset

This dataset is a subsample of the Diabetes One Thirty US dataset, generated with a seed of four. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its overall characteristics.

The dataset was subsampled to have a maximum of ten classes, one hundred columns, and two thousand rows. The subsampling process was stratified to ensure that the resulting dataset retained the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The dataset features include patient information such as race, gender, age, weight, and admission details. It also includes medical information such as laboratory procedures, medications, and diagnoses. Additionally, the dataset contains information about the patient's medical history, including previous hospitalizations and medications.

The dataset was generated using a Python script that utilized the NumPy and Pandas libraries. The script employed a random number generator to select the classes, columns, and rows to include in the subsampled dataset.
