The Monks' Problems: Problem Three

Once upon a time, in July nineteen ninety-one, the monks of Corsendonk Priory were faced with a school held in their priory, namely the Second European Summer School on Machine Learning. After listening more than one week to a wide variety of learning algorithms, they felt rather confused: Which algorithm would be optimal? And which one to avoid? As a consequence of this dilemma, they created a simple task on which all learning algorithms ought to be compared: the three Monks' Problems.

The target concept associated with the third Monks' problem is the binary outcome of the logical formula: the binary outcome of the logical formula is either the attribute five equals three and attribute four equals one, or attribute five does not equal four and attribute two does not equal three. In addition, five percent class noise was added to the training set.

In this dataset, the original train and test sets were merged to allow other sampling procedures. However, the original train-test splits can be found as one of the Open Machine Learning tasks.

### Attribute Information:

* Attribute one: takes values one, two, or three
* Attribute two: takes values one, two, or three
* Attribute three: takes values one or two
* Attribute four: takes values one, two, or three
* Attribute five: takes values one, two, three, or four
* Attribute six: takes values one or two

Dataset Information
Additional Information
The Monks' problems were the basis of a first international comparison of learning algorithms. The result of this comparison summarizes the generalization behavior of the learning techniques as applied by knowledgeable users. There are three Monks' problems. The domains for all Monks' problems are the same. One of the Monks' problems has noise added. For each problem, the domain has been partitioned into a train and test set.
