The Bechdel Cast Data Tags: Context 

In the Bechdel Cast, the question asked is, do movies have women in them, and are all their discussions centered around boyfriends or husbands, or do they have individualism? The patriarchy's vast influence permeates many aspects of our society, including the film industry. Let's start changing this status quo with the Bechdel Cast.

This dataset contains episode information for the comedy podcast, The Bechdel Cast, which examines movies through a feminist lens. One of the primary ways the hosts examine movies is by determining whether they pass the Bechdel Test, which assesses the representation of women in films. Additionally, they rate each movie using the Nipple Scale, which judges how well the movie portrays women. 

The dataset comprises pertinent information such as the movie title, the name of the weekly guest, the airdate, the movie's genre, whether it passes the Bechdel Test, and the Nipple Rating given by each host and guest, as well as the average rating for the movie discussed in each episode.

The dataset features include episode details, air dates, movie titles, guest names, Bechdel Test results, and ratings.
