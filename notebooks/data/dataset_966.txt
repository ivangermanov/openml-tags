This dataset contains information about baseball players and their performance statistics. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem. The features include various metrics related to a player's career, such as the number of seasons played, games participated in, and various batting and fielding statistics. The target variable has been simplified to a binary outcome, distinguishing between players in the majority class (labeled as positive) and all others (labeled as negative). This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to the data.
