The XD Six dataset is classified under Artificial, Machine Learning, and Manufacturing categories. This dataset originates from an unknown source, supposedly from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), but it cannot be found on their website anymore.

The XD Six dataset was previously utilized in a study, composed of ten features, one of which is irrelevant. The target variable is a disjunctive normal form formula constructed over the remaining nine attributes, with additional classification noise incorporated.

This dataset has been employed in various experiments, including the one conducted by researchers who examined its properties and behavior. More information about this dataset can be found in relevant literature.

Features included in this dataset are: Attribute One, Attribute Two, Attribute Three, Attribute Four, Attribute Five, Attribute Six, Attribute Seven, Attribute Eight, Attribute Nine, and Class.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Manufacturing, Classification Noise, Disjunctive Normal Form Formula.
