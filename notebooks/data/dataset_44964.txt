**Data Description**

The dataset contains information on superconductors and their relevant features, including the critical temperature. The goal is to predict the critical temperature based on the extracted features.

**Attribute Description**

All features describe the characteristics of superconductors, with the critical temperature as the target feature. The features include:

* Number of elements
* Mean atomic mass
* Weighted mean atomic mass
* Geometric mean atomic mass
* Weighted geometric mean atomic mass
* Entropy of atomic mass
* Weighted entropy of atomic mass
* Range of atomic mass
* Weighted range of atomic mass
* Standard deviation of atomic mass
* Weighted standard deviation of atomic mass

...and many more features related to atomic radius, density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence.

**Scraped Data**

The dataset consists of two files: train.csv and unique_m.csv. The train.csv file contains eighty-one features extracted from superconductors, along with the critical temperature. The unique_m.csv file contains the chemical formula broken down for each superconductor, along with the critical temperature and chemical formula.

The original data comes from a public source, and the goal is to predict the critical temperature based on the extracted features.

**Dataset Information**

There are no missing values in the dataset. For more information on the features, please refer to the relevant paper.
