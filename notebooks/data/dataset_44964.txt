The Superconductivity dataset contains information about twenty-one thousand plus superconductors and their relevant characteristics, including the critical temperature. The primary objective is to predict the critical temperature based on the extracted features.

All the features describe the properties of superconductors, with the critical temperature being the target feature. These features include atomic mass, atomic radius, density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence, among others.

The dataset consists of two files: a training file containing eighty-one features extracted from the superconductors, along with their corresponding critical temperatures, and a second file containing the chemical formulas broken down for each superconductor.

This dataset originates from a public source, specifically the NIMS Superconducting Materials Database, and does not contain any missing values. For further information regarding the features, please refer to the relevant research paper.
