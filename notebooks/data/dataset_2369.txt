Description 
The Cylinder Bands dataset aims to mitigate process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing using control rules discovered by decision tree induction. This dataset provides insights into the various factors affecting the occurrence of cylinder banding, enabling the development of effective strategies to minimize its impact.

Attribute Information 
The dataset comprises forty attributes for five hundred and forty observations, including the class attribute. Twenty of these attributes are numeric, while twenty are nominal. It is essential to note that three hundred and two instances contain missing values.

Attributes 
The dataset includes attributes such as timestamp, cylinder number, customer, job number, grain screened, ink color, proof on ctd ink, blade manufacturer, cylinder division, paper type, ink type, direct steam usage, solvent type, type on cylinder, press type, press, unit number, cylinder size, paper mill location, plating tank, proof cut, viscosity, caliper, ink temperature, humidity, roughness, blade pressure, varnish percentage, press speed, ink percentage, solvent percentage, ESA voltage, ESA amperage, wax, hardener, roller durometer, current density, anode space ratio, chrome content, and band type.

Notes 
It is crucial to ignore the cylinder number attribute when modeling the data since it serves as an identifier. Additionally, the dataset contains five hundred and forty observations, contrary to the six hundred and forty-one observations stated in the UCI explanation.

Relevant Papers 
Overcoming process delays with decision tree induction provides valuable insights into the application of decision tree induction in mitigating process delays.
