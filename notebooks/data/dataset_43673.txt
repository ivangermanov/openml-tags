Welcome to the Women's E-commerce Clothing Reviews dataset, which revolves around reviews written by customers and offers a comprehensive environment to analyze the text through its multiple dimensions. Since this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with "retailer".

This dataset includes a large collection of customer reviews, each containing various features that provide valuable insights into the customers' opinions and preferences. The features include Clothing Identification, which refers to the specific piece being reviewed; Age, which represents the reviewer's age; Title, which is a string variable for the title of the review; Review Text, which is a string variable for the review body; Rating, which is an ordinal integer variable representing the product score granted by the customer, ranging from one (worst) to five (best); Recommendation Indicator, which is a binary variable stating whether the customer recommends the product or not; Positive Feedback Count, which documents the number of other customers who found this review helpful; Division Name, which is a categorical name of the product's high-level division; Department Name, which is a categorical name of the product's department; and Class Name, which is a categorical name of the product's class.

The dataset provides a rich environment for natural language processing, offering opportunities for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and feature engineering. Additionally, the dataset allows for multivariate analysis, enabling researchers to explore relationships between various features and their impact on customer satisfaction and recommendation.
