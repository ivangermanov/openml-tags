Concrete Compressive Strength 
Tags: Images, Machine Learning 

Data Description 
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. Each instance represents a description, different features of concrete instance, including its compressive strength. The latter can be predicted using the other features about the concrete.

Attribute Description 
Cement amount in kilograms per cubic meter mixture 
Blast Furnace Slag amount in kilograms per cubic meter mixture 
Fly Ash amount in kilograms per cubic meter mixture 
Water amount in kilograms per cubic meter mixture 
Superplasticizer amount in kilograms per cubic meter mixture 
Coarse Aggregate amount in kilograms per cubic meter mixture 
Fine Aggregate amount in kilograms per cubic meter mixture 
Age in days ranging from one to three hundred sixty-five 
Strength in megapascals, target feature
