**Concrete Compressive Strength**

**Data Description**

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. Each instance represents a description, different features of concrete instance, including its compressive strength. The latter can be predicted using the other features about the concrete.

**Attribute Description**

The dataset consists of nine attributes, which are:

Cement, which is the amount in kilograms in a cubic meter mixture, Blast Furnace Slag, which is the amount in kilograms in a cubic meter mixture, Fly Ash, which is the amount in kilograms in a cubic meter mixture, Water, which is the amount in kilograms in a cubic meter mixture, Superplasticizer, which is the amount in kilograms in a cubic meter mixture, Coarse Aggregate, which is the amount in kilograms in a cubic meter mixture, Fine Aggregate, which is the amount in kilograms in a cubic meter mixture, Age, which is the age in days ranging from one to three hundred sixty-five, and Strength, which is the target feature measured in megapascals.

**Dataset Information**

The dataset contains one thousand thirty instances, with nine attributes, including eight quantitative input variables and one quantitative output variable. There are no missing attribute values in the dataset.

**Additional Information**

The concrete compressive strength is a regression problem. The order of the attributes in the dataset corresponds to the order of the variables listed above.
