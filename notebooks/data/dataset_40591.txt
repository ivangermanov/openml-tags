The GenBase dataset is a multi-label dataset that contains protein sequences which can be assigned to several classes of protein families. This dataset is primarily used for government-related research purposes.

The dataset features various characteristics of proteins, including their sequences and properties. Unfortunately, the specific details of these features are not easily interpretable by humans.

In essence, the GenBase dataset provides a collection of protein sequences that can belong to multiple categories simultaneously, making it an ideal resource for researchers exploring protein functions and relationships.
