The GenBase dataset contains protein sequences that can be assigned to several classes of protein families. This dataset is a multi-label dataset, meaning that each protein sequence can belong to multiple classes or families simultaneously. The dataset features a wide range of protein sequences, each with its unique characteristics and properties. These protein sequences are described by a set of features that are used to classify them into their respective protein families.

The dataset is particularly useful for training and testing machine learning models that can handle multi-label classification tasks. The protein sequences in the dataset can be classified into different families based on their structural and functional properties, making it a valuable resource for bioinformatics and proteomics research.
