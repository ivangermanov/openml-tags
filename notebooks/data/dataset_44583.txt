Micro Mass Seed Zero Dataset

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Micro Mass dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The dataset has been stratified to ensure that the class distribution is maintained. This is particularly important in datasets where certain classes may be underrepresented. By stratifying the dataset, we can ensure that the sampling process does not disproportionately affect any particular class.

The dataset consists of a subset of columns and rows from the original Micro Mass dataset. The column selection process involved uniformly sampling from the available columns, while the row selection process involved stratified sampling based on the class labels.

The resulting dataset has been carefully curated to maintain the integrity of the original data while reducing its size and complexity. This makes it ideal for use in machine learning models and other applications where smaller datasets are preferred.
