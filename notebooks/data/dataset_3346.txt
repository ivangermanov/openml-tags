QSAR-TID-10244 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10244. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 396 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The target protein is Caspase-8, also known as Apoptotic cysteine protease or Apoptotic protease Mch-5. It is a single protein and is classified as an enzyme, protease, and cysteine protease. It belongs to the cysteine protease CD clan and cysteine protease C14 family.

Caspase-8 is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, regulation of cytokine production, proteolysis, and apoptotic process. It is also involved in the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway and the activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process.

The protein is expressed in various cellular components, including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and cytosol. It is also involved in various protein complexes, including the death-inducing signaling complex and the ripoptosome.
