This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10244. The dataset has 396 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September two thousand fifteen.
