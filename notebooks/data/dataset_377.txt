Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description:
This dataset consists of synthetically generated control charts for time series classification. It contains examples of control charts created using the process described by Alcock and Manolopoulos. The dataset encompasses six distinct classes of control charts: Normal, Cyclic, Increasing trend, Decreasing trend, Upward shift, and Downward shift.

Dataset Information:
The Synthetic Control Chart Time Series dataset is composed of synthetically generated control charts. These charts were created to represent various patterns and trends in time series data. The six classes of control charts included in this dataset provide a diverse range of scenarios for analysis and classification tasks.

Relevance:
This dataset is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners working on time series analysis, pattern recognition, and control chart classification. It has been utilized in studies employing feature based approaches and self organizing neural networks for control chart pattern recognition.

Data Characteristics:
The dataset contains a total of examples, with each example representing a synthetic control chart. The features of the dataset correspond to time series measurements, allowing for the analysis of temporal patterns and trends. The class labels indicate the type of control chart represented by each example.

Applications:
The Synthetic Control Chart Time Series dataset has applications in various fields, including quality control, process monitoring, and anomaly detection. It can be used to develop and evaluate algorithms for automatically classifying control charts and identifying specific patterns or trends in time series data.

References:
The dataset is associated with research conducted at the University of Ioannina, Greece, and has been referenced in publications related to time series similarity queries and control chart pattern recognition. It is publicly available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository, providing a valuable resource for the machine learning and data mining communities.
