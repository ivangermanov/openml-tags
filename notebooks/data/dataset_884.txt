Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset (see version one). It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: The dataset includes several features, some of which may be difficult to interpret without additional context. The final feature is binaryClass, which represents the transformed target variable.

This dataset appears to be designed for use in regression analysis and classification tasks. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem, which could be useful for testing and comparing different machine learning algorithms or for educational purposes in data science courses. The transformation process involves determining a threshold (the mean of the original target variable) and using this to divide the instances into two distinct classes.

The original source and creation date of this dataset are not specified, which may limit the ability to provide proper attribution or understand the full context of its creation and intended use. Researchers and data scientists using this dataset should be aware of its modified nature and consider how this might impact their analyses and conclusions.
