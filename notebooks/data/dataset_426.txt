This is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The other datasets are taken exactly from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

Original studies include research on carbolenes, melting point prediction, molecular diversity validation, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, QSAR analysis, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PDGFR inhibitors, structure-activity relationships, predictive toxicology, biodegradability of anilines and phenols, acute toxicity of halogenated aliphatic compounds, biodegradation of dioxins and furans, dehalogenation of haloaliphatic compounds, hydrolytic dehalogenation of chloro- and bromo-alkenes, haloalkane dehalogenase mutants, purposely modified proteins, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and antifilarial antimycin analogues.

The datasets cover a wide range of chemical and biological properties, utilizing various computational methods and software tools for analysis. They represent significant contributions to the fields of medicinal chemistry, drug design, toxicology, and structure-activity relationships. The diverse nature of these studies highlights the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of modern pharmaceutical research and development.
