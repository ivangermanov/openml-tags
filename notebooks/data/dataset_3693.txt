Wine Dataset 
Tags: Earth Science, Machine Learning 

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of thirteen constituents found in each of the three types of wines. Initially, the data set had around thirty variables, but unfortunately, I only have the thirteen-dimensional version available now. I once had a list of all thirty variables, but regrettably, I lost it and would not be able to identify which thirteen variables are included in this particular set.

The attributes are:

Alcohol 
Malic Acid 
Ash 
Alkalinity of Ash 
Magnesium 
Total Phenols 
Flavonoids 
Non-flavonoid Phenols 
Proanthocyanins 
Colour Intensity 
Hue 
Optical Density at 280 nm divided by Optical Density at 315 nm of Diluted Wines 
Proline 

In a classification context, this is a well-posed problem with well-behaved class structures. This makes it a suitable data set for initially testing a new classifier, although it may not prove to be particularly challenging.
