QSAR-TID-11192 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11192. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has several compounds with activity values on the drug target Endothelin-Converting Enzyme 1, which is a single protein. This enzyme is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, peptide hormone processing, and regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure.

The dataset contains features such as MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each compound, and MEDIAN PX50, which is a measure of the compound's activity. The features also include FCFP6 1024, which are molecular fingerprints generated from the SMILES strings of the compounds.

The Endothelin-Converting Enzyme 1 is a metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function. It is involved in the processing of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor, and is also implicated in various diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening. The project involves the collection and curation of QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL, and the development of machine learning models for predicting compound activity.
