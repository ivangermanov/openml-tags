Machine Learning Dataset: Churn Seed One 

This dataset is a subsampling of the original Churn dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniform sampling of classes, columns, and rows to reduce the overall size of the dataset while maintaining its representative characteristics.

The dataset has been stratified to ensure that the resulting sample is representative of the original population. This was achieved by selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency distribution, and then uniformly sampling the indices where these classes were present. The resulting dataset has a specified maximum number of classes, columns, and rows.

The features of this dataset include various customer attributes and behaviors, such as state, account length, area code, phone number, international plan, voice mail plan, and others. These features are used to predict a target variable, which represents the churn status of customers.

The dataset has undergone preprocessing steps to prepare it for machine learning modeling. Categorical columns have been converted to string format to facilitate modeling. The dataset is ready for use in machine learning experiments, and can be used to develop predictive models for customer churn prediction.
