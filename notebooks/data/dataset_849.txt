This binarized version of the original dataset converts the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset originally consisted of various features including Strata, Plot, Paddock, and different types of grasses and legumes observed over several years. These features have been simplified for easier analysis.

The resulting binary classification allows for a more straightforward examination of the relationships between these different factors. This can be useful in understanding the dynamics at play in these ecosystems and identifying potential areas for further research.
