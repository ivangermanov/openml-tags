**Wilt Data Set**

**Abstract:**
This high-resolution remote sensing data set, obtained from Quickbird imagery, is characterized by a small number of training samples of diseased trees and a large number of samples for other land cover. The testing data set is derived from a stratified random sample of the image.

**Data Set Information:**
This data set contains training and testing data from a remote sensing study that involved detecting diseased trees in Quickbird imagery. The data set consists of image segments, generated by segmenting the pansharpened image, which contain spectral information from the Quickbird multispectral image bands and texture information from the panchromatic image band. The testing data set is specifically designed for the row with Segmentation scale fifteen segments and original multi-spectral image Spectral information.

**Attribute Information:**
The data set includes a class attribute with two categories: 'w' for diseased trees and 'n' for all other land cover. Additionally, it includes attributes such as GLCM mean texture from the panchromatic band, mean green value, mean red value, mean near-infrared value, and standard deviation from the panchromatic band.

**Relevant Papers:**
A hybrid pansharpening approach and multiscale object-based image analysis for mapping diseased pine and oak trees.
