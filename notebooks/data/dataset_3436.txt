QSAR-TID-101392 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101392. The dataset has thirty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101392. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Proteinase-activated receptor two, which is a single protein target.

The Proteinase-activated receptor two is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and blood coagulation. It is activated by proteases, such as thrombin, and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to various cellular responses.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new therapeutic agents targeting the Proteinase-activated receptor two. It can be used to develop and validate QSAR models, which can help predict the activity of new compounds and identify potential leads for further optimization.
