QSAR-TID-102807 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102807. It consists of eighteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

Scraped Data:

The preferred name of the protein target is C-C Chemokine Receptor Type Five, also known as C-C Chemokine Receptor Type Five, C-C CKR-Five, CC-CKR-Five, CCR Five, and CCR-Five. It belongs to the species Macaca Fascicularis and is classified under family A G protein-coupled receptors, peptide receptors, and chemokine receptors.

The protein target is involved in various biological processes, including chemotaxis, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and chemokine-mediated signaling pathways. It is located on the external side of the plasma membrane and is responsible for G protein-coupled receptor activity, chemokine receptor activity, and C-C chemokine receptor activity.
