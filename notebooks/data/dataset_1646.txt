This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred one thousand three hundred ninety two, and it has thirty seven rows and one thousand twenty six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is related to economics and life science, specifically the study of QSAR and molecular fingerprints.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule in the dataset, while the median pXC fifty represents the activity value of each compound.

The proteinase activated receptor two is a single protein that is targeted by the compounds in this dataset. It is also known as coagulation factor two receptor like one, F two RL one, GPR eleven, and G protein coupled receptor eleven.

This receptor is involved in various biological processes, including immune response, inflammatory response, and blood coagulation. It is also associated with various cellular components, including plasma membrane, early endosome, Golgi apparatus, and pseudopodium.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, proteinase activated receptor two, coagulation factor two receptor like one, immune response, inflammatory response, blood coagulation.
