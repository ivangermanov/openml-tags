National Hockey League Interviews

This dataset was scraped from ASAP Sports, using a custom web scraping code designed to account for most of the variance in the website's formatting. However, some web pages with significantly different formatting were ignored to ensure data quality.

The dataset contains transcripts of interviews with National Hockey League players, coaches, and other team officials. Each row represents a unique interview, with columns for the teams involved, the date of the interview, the name of the person being interviewed, their job title, and the transcript of the interview itself.

The job title column takes one of three values: player, coach, or other. Players and coaches are assigned their respective titles if they held those positions at the time of the interview. Otherwise, they are categorized as "other", which includes general managers, league officials, and commentators. Some job titles were assigned automatically based on the title mentioned in the transcript, while others were assigned manually.

The transcript column contains the text of the interview, with responses separated by periods. Note that interviewer questions were not collected, so the text only includes the responses from the interviewee. A possible source of error is the failure to ignore interviewer questions, which may have been included in the transcript.

This dataset has been used to train a chatbot to respond to messages in the style of a hockey player. The chatbot can continue an interview response with a five-sentence continuation, making it a fun and interactive way to engage with hockey fans.

The idea to scrape interviews from ASAP Sports originated from an article by an independent researcher. This dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore how speech patterns of NHL coaches and players differ, whether coaches are more positive or team-oriented, and how hockey interview responses have changed over the years.
