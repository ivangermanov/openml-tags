The binarized version of this dataset has been created from the original dataset. In this version, the multi-class target feature has been transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative. 

This dataset comprises various features including site, fruit characteristics such as weight and composition, and physical properties like color and texture. It also includes measures of sugar content, flavor, and fiber, among others. The goal of this dataset is to enable researchers to explore the relationships between these different factors and the resulting quality of squash.
