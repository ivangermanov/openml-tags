Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

Features: site, days after flowering, fruit, weight, penetration, solids, brix, a star, early growing degree days, full growing degree days, groundspot a star, glucose, fructose, sucrose, total, glucose plus fructose, starch, sweetness, flavour, dry or moist, fibre, heat input emergence, heat input flower, binary class

This dataset focuses on various attributes of squash fruits, including their physical characteristics, chemical composition, and growing conditions. It has been modified from its original form to create a binary classification problem. The features encompass a wide range of measurements, from basic attributes like weight and fruit type to more specific factors such as sugar content and heat input during different growth stages. This dataset could be valuable for agricultural research, particularly in studying factors that influence squash quality and yield.
