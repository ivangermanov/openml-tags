Abstract: This dataset is a modified version of the original poker hand dataset, with the minority class removed to create a nine-class classification problem. The dataset focuses on identifying different poker hand combinations based on various card attributes.

The features in this dataset represent different aspects of playing cards, including their suits and ranks. These attributes are used to determine the type of poker hand present. The class variable indicates the specific poker hand category.

This dataset is particularly useful for studying concept drift, which refers to changes in the statistical properties of a target variable over time. By analyzing how poker hand classifications may shift or evolve, researchers can gain insights into handling dynamic and changing data distributions in machine learning applications.

The Poker Hand dataset provides an interesting challenge for classification algorithms, as it requires understanding the complex relationships between card combinations and their corresponding poker hand rankings. It can be used to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately identifying poker hands based on card information.
