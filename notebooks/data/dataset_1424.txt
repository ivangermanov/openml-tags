QSAR-TID-275 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoid X Receptor Alpha, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP 1024 bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
