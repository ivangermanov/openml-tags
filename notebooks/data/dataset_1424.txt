This dataset is part of the LIBSVM data repository.

The original Adult dataset has fourteen features, among which six are continuous and eight are categorical. In this dataset, continuous features are discretized into quantiles, and each quantile is represented by a binary feature. Additionally, a categorical feature with multiple categories is converted to multiple binary features. 

Details on how each feature is converted can be found at the beginning of each file from the research.microsoft.com webpage.

Features include various attributes, which have been transformed from their original format for better analysis.
