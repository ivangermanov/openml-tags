Diabetes Dataset 2019 Tags: Context

This dataset was collected for research and non-commercial purposes only. The dataset is accompanied by a published article that provides more information and citation details.

The dataset consists of a total of instances with seventeen independent predictor variables and one binary target or dependent variable, Diabetes. The goal is to build a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.

The dataset contains a range of features that are relevant to diabetes prediction, including demographic information, lifestyle habits, and medical history. These features are crucial in understanding the factors that contribute to the development of diabetes.

The authors would like to extend their gratitude to all the participants who contributed to the building of this dataset.

The inspiration behind this dataset is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict whether a person has diabetes or not, based on a set of input features.

Features: Age, Gender, Family History of Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Physical Activity, Body Mass Index, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Sleep Patterns, Sound Sleep, Regular Medication, Junk Food Consumption, Stress Levels, Blood Pressure Levels, Pregnancies, and Urination Frequency.
