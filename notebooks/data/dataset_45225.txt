**Diabetes Bayesian Network. Sample 6.**

The bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference is a comprehensive resource for Bayesian network models. This particular model, Diabetes Bayesian Network, is a discrete-very large model that consists of a large number of nodes and arcs.

The model has a total of nodes, which are interconnected by arcs. The number of parameters in the model is substantial, indicating a high degree of complexity. The average Markov blanket size is moderate, while the average degree is relatively low. The maximum in-degree of the nodes is also relatively low.

The model is a result of a collaborative effort by several researchers, who have developed a model-based approach to insulin adjustment. This approach has been presented in a conference proceedings publication.

The model features a wide range of variables, including meal, CHO, CHO initial, insulin absorption, active insulin, insulin sensitivity, gut absorption, blood glucose, renal clearance, insulin independent utility, insulin dependent utility, glucose production, insulin independent, insulin dependent, endogenous balance, CHO balance, basal balance, total balance, and metabolic insulin resistance. These variables are measured at multiple time points, including zero, one, two, three, four, and five.
