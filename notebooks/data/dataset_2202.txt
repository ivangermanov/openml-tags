The QSAR-TID-10230 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10230. This dataset has nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature, MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and MEDIAN PX50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10230. It has nineteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature, MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, and MEDIAN PX50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive repository of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

Scraped data includes information about the protein target, such as its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. It also includes information about the protein's functions, processes, and components, as well as its relationships with other proteins and molecules.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot program, MetaQSAR project, protein target classification, protein function, protein process, protein component.
