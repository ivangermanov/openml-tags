This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred forty-eight, and it has sixty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and then there are many molecular fingerprint features.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

The target is the Purinergic Receptor P two Y fourteen, also known as GPR one hundred five, G-Protein Coupled Receptor one hundred five, KIAA zero zero zero one, P two RY fourteen, and P two Y fourteen. It is a single protein, and its preferred name is Purinergic Receptor P two Y fourteen. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens, and it is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and nucleotide-like receptor.

Keywords: QSAR, molecular fingerprints, Purinergic Receptor P2Y14, GPCRs, molecular modeling.
