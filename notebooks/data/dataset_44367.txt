Name: Wine Dataset Subsample with Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the Wine dataset with seed equal to zero, generated with specific arguments for number of rows, number of columns, number of classes, and stratification.

This dataset is a subsample of the original Wine dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected classes are present in the resulting subsample. The number of classes was limited to a maximum, and the classes were selected based on their frequency in the original dataset.

The subsample also involved uniformly sampling columns from the original dataset, ensuring that the selected columns are representative of the original dataset. The number of columns was limited to a maximum, and the columns were selected randomly.

The resulting subsample has a specific number of rows, which was achieved through stratified sampling. This means that the subsample has a balanced representation of the different classes, ensuring that the dataset is suitable for machine learning tasks.

The dataset features include various characteristics of wine, such as acidity, sugar content, and sulfur dioxide levels.
