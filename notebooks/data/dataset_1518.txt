Robot Failures LP Dataset

Tags: mf less than, study

This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

The dataset includes multiple subsets, each defining a different learning problem:

- Failures in approach to grasp position
- Failures in transfer of a part
- Position of part after a transfer failure (This specific dataset)
- Failures in approach to ungrasp position
- Failures in motion with part

To improve classification accuracy, a set of feature transformation strategies was defined and evaluated. These strategies, based on statistical summary features and discrete Fourier transform, enabled an average improvement of accuracy.

All features are numeric, although they are integer valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection. Each failure instance is characterized in terms of force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection. The total observation window for each failure instance was of milliseconds.

Each example is described with the evolution of forces and torques in the observation window. There is a total of features, representing the changes in forces and torques over time.

This dataset is part of a larger study on robot learning at the task level, focusing on the assembly domain. It explores integration and learning in supervision of flexible assembly systems, as well as feature transformation strategies for robot learning problems.

The data can be used to analyze and predict robot execution failures, particularly in tasks involving grasping, transferring, and moving parts. By studying the force and torque patterns, researchers can develop better algorithms for detecting and preventing failures in robotic systems.
