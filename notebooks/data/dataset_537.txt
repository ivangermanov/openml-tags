The Houses dataset was obtained from the nineteen ninety census data of California. This sample comprises block groups, which on average include approximately one thousand four hundred twenty-five individuals residing in a geographically compact area. It is worth noting that the geographical area encompassed varies inversely with the population density. Distances among the centroids of each block group were calculated based on their latitude and longitude measurements. Block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables were excluded from the analysis. Consequently, the final dataset consists of twenty thousand six hundred forty observations across nine variables. The dependent variable of interest is the natural logarithm of median house value.
