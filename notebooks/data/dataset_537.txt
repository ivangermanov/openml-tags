Data description:
S&P Letters Data

Information on the variables was collected using all the block groups in California from the Census. In this sample, a block group on average includes individuals living in a geographically compact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. Distances among the centroids of each block group were computed as measured in latitude and longitude. All block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables were excluded. The final data contained observations on variables. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of median house value.

This dataset is derived from a comprehensive study of housing characteristics across California. It encompasses a wide range of factors that influence property values, including demographic information, geographical location, and housing attributes. The data provides valuable insights into the real estate market and socioeconomic patterns within the state.

The variables included in the dataset offer a multifaceted view of each block group, allowing for in-depth analysis of the relationships between various factors and housing prices. By examining median income, housing age, room counts, population density, and geographical coordinates, researchers can explore the complex interplay of elements that shape the California housing market.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for urban planners, economists, and policymakers seeking to understand housing trends and make informed decisions regarding community development and real estate investments. The granularity of the data at the block group level provides a detailed picture of local variations in housing characteristics across the diverse landscape of California.
