QSAR-TID-100287 Dataset Information

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100287. The dataset has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
