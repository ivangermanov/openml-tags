QSAR-TID-100287 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Type One Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Type One Receptor. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Type One Receptor, which is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family B G protein-coupled receptor.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, calcium ion transport, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway. It is also associated with several diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Type One Receptor.
