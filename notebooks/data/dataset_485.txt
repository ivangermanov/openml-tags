The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". This dataset is one of the most widely used functions for data generation. It includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output.

The Friedman function is a mathematical equation that generates the output based on five input features. The function includes a sine term, an exponential term, and a linear term, with a normalized noise added to the output.

To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. 

Collinearity degree refers to the number of features depending on other features. The generated Friedman dataset's parameters are varied to create different scenarios. 

The number of features varies from a small set to a large set, with some features being relevant to the output and others being completely random. Similarly, the number of samples also varies from a small size to a larger size. 

Different collinearity degrees are also applied to the datasets, ranging from zero to four. The combination of these variations results in eighty artificial datasets.
