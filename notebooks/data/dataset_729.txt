Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on visualizing slope and has been binarized from its original form. The process involved converting a numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean value and then classifying instances below this mean as positive, denoted by 'P', while instances above the mean were classified as negative, denoted by 'N'. This binarization technique allows for a simplified analysis of the data, potentially revealing insights that may not be as apparent in the continuous numeric form.

The dataset is associated with various studies and mythbusting efforts, suggesting its potential use in educational or research contexts. It likely serves as a tool for examining relationships between different variables and their impact on slope visualization. The binarized nature of the data may facilitate easier pattern recognition and hypothesis testing in related studies.

Features included in this dataset are error, percent, distance, and binary class. These features provide information about the accuracy, proportional measurements, spatial relationships, and the binary classification of data points within the context of slope visualization.
