The Fri C Five Hundred Fifty Dataset is a binarized regression problem related to chemistry and life science. This dataset is a modified version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was done by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive (denoted by 'P') and all others as negative (denoted by 'N').

This dataset has numerous features, including various chemical compounds and properties. Unfortunately, these features are not easily interpretable and are denoted by codes such as oz1, oz2, and so on.

This dataset has been used in various studies, including Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, Study Seven, and Study Eighty-Eight.
