Visualizing Slope Dataset: A Binarized Version for Chemistry and Life Science Studies

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set, specifically designed for chemistry and life science studies. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The resulting dataset features include Error, Percentage, and Distance. These features provide valuable insights for researchers and students conducting studies in chemistry and life science fields.
