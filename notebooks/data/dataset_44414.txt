The MiniBooNE dataset has been subsampled using a specific set of arguments to generate a new dataset. This dataset has been generated with a seed value, which ensures reproducibility. The maximum number of rows has been limited, and the maximum number of classes has also been restricted. Furthermore, the maximum number of columns has been capped.

The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, selecting the indices where one of these classes is present, and then uniformly sampling columns if required. The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original data, with a limited number of rows, columns, and classes.

The dataset features a range of particle IDs, including particle ID zero through forty-nine, as well as a signal feature.
