Name: MiniBooNE Seed Two 

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset MiniBooNE with seed equals two 

This dataset is a subsample of the original MiniBooNE dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of columns, and then further subsampling the resulting dataset to meet the specified maximum number of rows. 

The original dataset was filtered to include only a subset of classes, selected randomly from the total number of unique classes present in the dataset. The classes were chosen based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset, with more frequent classes being more likely to be selected. 

Once the classes were selected, the dataset was filtered to include only the rows where one of these classes was present. The resulting dataset was then further filtered to include only a subset of columns, selected randomly from the total number of columns present in the dataset. 

Finally, the dataset was subsampled to meet the specified maximum number of rows, using a stratified sampling approach to ensure that the resulting dataset retained the same class balance as the original dataset.
