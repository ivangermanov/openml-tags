Classify a chess game based on the position of the white king, the white rook, and the black king. This classification task involves analyzing the spatial relationships between these key pieces on the chessboard. The positions are represented by the column and row coordinates for each piece. The goal is to determine the game outcome or strategic situation based solely on these piece locations. This type of analysis can provide insights into endgame scenarios and positional advantages in chess.
