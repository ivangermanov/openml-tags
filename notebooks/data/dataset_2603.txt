This multivariate regression data set is part of the SCPF tags collection, specifically categorized under 2019 Multi Output Paper Benchmark Data, Culture, and Social Media. 

The data set originates from a research article published in Springer, which is a pre-processed version of the data used in Kaggle's See Click Predict Fix competition. 

The primary objective of this data set is to predict three target variables: the number of views, clicks, and comments a specific Three-One-One issue will receive. 

These issues have been gathered from four major cities in the United States - Oakland, Richmond, New Haven, and Chicago - spanning a period of twelve months. 

For this particular version, a random one percent sample of the data has been utilized. 

In terms of features, the data includes the duration an issue stays online, the source from which the issue was created, the type of issue, geographical coordinates, the city where it was published, and the distance from the city center.

All multi-valued nominal variables underwent transformation into binary, and subsequently, rare binary variables with less than one percent occurrence were eliminated.
