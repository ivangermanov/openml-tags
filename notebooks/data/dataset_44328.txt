**Meta Album Textures DTD Dataset Extended**

The Textures DTD dataset is a large textures dataset consisting of images. The data is collected from Google and Flickr by the original authors of the paper "Describing Textures in the Wild". The data was annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The data collection process is mentioned on the dataset overview page.

For Meta Album meta-dataset, this dataset is preprocessed by cropping the images to square images and then resizing them to a uniform size using Open-CV with an anti-aliasing filter. This dataset has forty-seven class labels.
