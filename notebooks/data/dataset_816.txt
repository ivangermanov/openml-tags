The Japanese Vowels dataset has been modified to create a binarized version of the original data set. This new version involves converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

This dataset falls under the categories of Chemistry, Life Science, Study One, Study Forty-One, and Study Seven. 

Features of this dataset include Utterance and Frame.
