The Puma dataset is a binarized regression problem that originated from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This particular version of the dataset is a modified form of the original, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing all instances with lower target values as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. The dataset consists of various features, including theta one, theta two, and theta three, which are related to angular measurements.
