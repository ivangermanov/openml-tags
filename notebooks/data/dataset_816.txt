Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, likely used for mythbusting and various studies. The original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification task. This transformation was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This conversion allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset includes several features related to angles (theta) and their derivatives (thetad), as well as torque measurements (tau). The final feature, binaryClass, represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.

Researchers utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation and be aware of its modified nature compared to the original version. The binarization process may have implications for the interpretation of results and the applicability of certain analytical methods.
