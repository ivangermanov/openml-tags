This dataset, Churn Modelling, contains detailed information about a bank's customers, with the primary goal of predicting whether a customer will remain with the bank or choose to close their account. The target variable is a binary indicator reflecting this outcome.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of each customer, including factors such as their credit score, age, current balance, estimated salary, geographical location, membership status, tenure, gender, possession of a credit card, and the number of products they hold.
