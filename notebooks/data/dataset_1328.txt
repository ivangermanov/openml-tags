QSAR-TID-11866 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11866. It has forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty. 

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and fingerprint features.
