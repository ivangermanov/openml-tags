Computer Systems and Machine Learning are fascinating fields, and what better way to learn them than through practical projects? I decided to start my own project, inspired by numerous housing datasets on Kaggle. Predicting housing prices is a simple yet insightful regression problem.

Understanding data takes time, and the more people analyze it, the faster secrets can be uncovered. To acquire the data, I scraped ImmoScout24, a marketplace for German real estate.

The dataset features include price, type of property, living space, lot size, usable area, free of relation, number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, year built, furnishing quality, year renovated, condition, heating system, energy source, energy certificate, energy consumption, energy efficiency class, state, city, place, garages, and garage type.
