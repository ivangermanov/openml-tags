Timing Attack Dataset - Twenty Micro Seconds Delay - Created on Fourteenth September Two Thousand Twenty-Two

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Bleichenbacher Timing Attack

This dataset was created to analyze the Bleichenbacher Timing Attack, which is a type of attack on SSL/TLS protocols. The attack takes advantage of the difference in time taken by the server to respond to different types of encrypted messages.

Attribute Descriptions:

The dataset contains attributes related to three types of messages: Change Cipher Spec, TLS Alert, and TCP Disconnect. Each message type has several attributes describing its characteristics.

Change Cipher Spec Messages:
The attributes for Change Cipher Spec messages include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and order.

TLS Alert Messages:
The attributes for TLS Alert messages include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and order.

TCP Disconnect Messages:
The attributes for TCP Disconnect messages include source port, destination port, port, stream, length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, flags, window size value, window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, options, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and order.

Fold ID and Vulnerable Classes:
The dataset also includes a fold ID and five vulnerable classes: incorrectly formatted PKCS one padding, correctly formatted PKCS one PMS message but one byte shorter, no zero in message, wrong first byte, and wrong second byte.
