**Hailfinder Bayesian Network**

This Bayesian network is part of the bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository, specifically listed under discrete large networks.

The Hailfinder Bayesian Network consists of fifty-six nodes and sixty-six arcs, resulting in two thousand six hundred fifty-six parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five four, while the average degree is around two point three six. The maximum in-degree is four.

This network was designed to forecast severe weather, particularly hail storms. It takes into account various factors such as atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and cloud formations to predict the likelihood of hail.

The network incorporates a range of features, including cloud cover, moisture levels, temperature, wind direction, and more. These factors are interconnected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric conditions that lead to hail storms.

To utilize this network, researchers and meteorologists can input data related to these features and run simulations to forecast the probability of hail. This can help improve weather forecasting accuracy and provide early warnings for severe weather events.
