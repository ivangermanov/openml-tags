The Bank Marketing dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. These marketing campaigns relied heavily on phone calls, often requiring multiple contacts with the same client to determine whether they would ultimately subscribe to the product, which is a bank term deposit. The primary objective of this classification task is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, as indicated by the variable "will the client subscribe".

Features used to achieve this goal include various attributes, including those related to the client's personal information and interaction history.
