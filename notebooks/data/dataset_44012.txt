Ailerons 
Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark.

This dataset addresses a control problem, specifically flying an F sixteen aircraft. The attributes describe the status of the airplane, while the goal is to predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft. The dataset is used to predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft, which is a critical component of flying an F sixteen. The attributes in the dataset provide a comprehensive description of the airplane's status, including its climb rate, pitch, roll, and other relevant factors.
