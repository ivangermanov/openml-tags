Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by re-labeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: This dataset contains numerous attributes labeled as "att" followed by numbers, ranging from att to att. The final feature is labeled as binaryClass.

This dataset represents a modified version of an original multi-class dataset. The modification process involved binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a multi-class classification problem into a binary classification task. In this new format, the majority class is designated as positive ('P'), while all other classes are grouped together and labeled as negative ('N'). This conversion allows for simplified binary analysis and modeling.

The dataset's features are numerically labeled, suggesting they may represent quantitative measurements or derived values relevant to the classification task at hand. The specific nature of these features is not explicitly stated, but they likely capture various aspects or characteristics of the objects or instances being classified.

The binaryClass feature serves as the target variable for predictive modeling, enabling researchers and data scientists to develop and evaluate binary classification algorithms using this dataset.
