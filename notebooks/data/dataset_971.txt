The MFEAT Fourier dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative.

Originally, this conversion was done to facilitate easier analysis and processing of the data. This dataset is particularly useful for those studying chemistry and life sciences.

The dataset consists of numerous attributes, including various chemical and biological properties. These attributes are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms and relationships within the data.

The binary class feature allows researchers to focus on specific aspects of the data, enabling more targeted and effective analysis.
