Name: Elevators
Tags: Study

This dataset is derived from the task of controlling an F aircraft, although the target variable and attributes differ from the ailerons domain. In this instance, the goal variable is associated with an action taken on the elevators of the aircraft. The dataset encompasses various features related to aircraft control and performance metrics, including climb rate, roll characteristics, time-based measurements, and other relevant parameters. These features provide a comprehensive set of inputs for analyzing and predicting elevator actions in aircraft control scenarios.
