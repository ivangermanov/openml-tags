The QSAR-TID-20032 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20032. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features, such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

The target of this dataset is Neuropeptide Y receptor type five, also known as Npy five, Npy five R, and NPY five R. It is a single protein preferred name and belongs to the species group Mus musculus.

This protein target classification is one point membrane receptor family A G protein coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR Neuropeptide Y receptor.

It has multiple descriptions, relationships, accession, expression atlas, component, function, process, and canSAR-target information available.

Some of its functions include peptide YY receptor activity, pancreatic polypeptide receptor activity, G protein coupled receptor activity, Neuropeptide Y receptor activity, and Neuropeptide binding.

It is involved in multiple biological processes, such as positive regulation of acute inflammatory response, negative regulation of acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus, outflow tract morphogenesis, cardiac left ventricle morphogenesis, signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, Neuropeptide signaling pathway, chemical synaptic transmission, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, negative regulation of glutamate secretion, negative regulation of synaptic transmission GABAergic, eating behavior, negative regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, generation of ovulation cycle rhythm, positive regulation of ERK one and ERK two cascade, and synaptic signaling via Neuropeptide.
