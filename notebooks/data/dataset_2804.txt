FOREX EUR NZD Hourly High Tags: finance, forex, machine learning, text and literature

Data Description

This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex EUR/NZD pair, sourced from Dukascopy's Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a single hourly candlestick, spanning from January to December. As Forex markets do not operate on weekends, these days are excluded from the dataset. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the direction of the mean high price in the subsequent hour, based on the current hourly data. To achieve this, the class attribute is defined as follows: if the mean high price increases in the next hour, the class attribute is true; otherwise, it remains false.

Please note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. In real-world trading scenarios, it is essential to apply predictive models to the close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
