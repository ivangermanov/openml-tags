This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Melanocortin Receptor One, and it has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Pseudo-pCI Fifty.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint One Zero Two Four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September Twenty Fifteen.
