Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (WDBC)

Tags: cancer, medical, OpenML-CC18, OpenML100, study, uci

This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. The target feature records the prognosis as either benign or malignant.

The dataset was originally sourced from the University of Wisconsin and is available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It has been adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version, with sample code identifiers removed.

It's important to note that there is a related Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set with a different set of features, known as breast-w.

Feature Description:
Ten real-valued features are computed for each of three cell nuclei, yielding a total of thirty descriptive features. These features include:

- Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- Compactness (perimeter squared divided by area minus one)
- Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" minus one)

These features were computed using methods detailed in relevant research papers, which discuss nuclear feature extraction for breast tumor diagnosis and the use of linear programming in breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

The dataset has been used in various studies and is included in multiple OpenML study collections. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of machine learning and medical diagnostics, particularly in the area of breast cancer detection and classification.
