**Data Description**

This dataset comprises historical price data of the Forex Australian Dollar/New Zealand Dollar exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one hourly candlestick. The entire dataset spans from January to December and excludes weekends, as Forex markets are closed during these periods. The timestamp feature adheres to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price over the subsequent hour relative to the mean high price of the current hour. Specifically, the class attribute assumes a value of true if the mean high price increases over the following hour and false if it decreases or remains unchanged.

**Note:** This task is hypothetical and intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should rely on predictions based on close attributes (also available).
