Name: QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically doesn't require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Serine/threonine protein kinase GAK, also known as Cyclin G associated kinase. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase classification, specifically in the NAK family of other protein kinases. It is associated with various cellular components including the cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, focal adhesions, membranes, vesicles, and presynapses.

GAK exhibits numerous molecular functions such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, clathrin binding, cyclin binding, and protein folding chaperone binding. It is involved in biological processes including protein phosphorylation, receptor mediated endocytosis, endoplasmic reticulum organization, Golgi organization, cell cycle regulation, synaptic vesicle uncoating, and clathrin dependent endocytosis.

The protein has been studied in various databases and resources including ExpressionAtlas, Gene Ontology, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro. It is associated with domains such as protein kinase, DnaJ, and tensin phosphatase domains.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is intended for use in quantitative structure activity relationship studies. Researchers using this data are requested to cite the original source appropriately.
