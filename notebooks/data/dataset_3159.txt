Bike Sharing Demand

Machine Learning, OpenML-Reg19

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process, from membership to rental and return, has become fully automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from one location and return it at another. With over five hundred bike-sharing programs worldwide, comprising more than five hundred thousand bicycles, there exists a significant interest in these systems due to their crucial role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health-related issues.

Apart from their fascinating real-world applications, the characteristics of data generated by these systems make them appealing for research purposes. Unlike other transportation services, such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in bike sharing systems. This feature transforms bike sharing systems into a virtual sensor network capable of detecting mobility within cities, enabling the detection of most significant events occurring within urban areas through monitoring these data.

The bike sharing rental process is highly correlated with environmental and seasonal settings. Factors such as weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and hour of the day can significantly impact rental behavior.

The core dataset is comprised of a two-year historical log corresponding to the years twenty eleven and twenty twelve from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly available. We aggregated the data on a two-hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information was obtained from Freemeteo.
