Phishing Websites Dataset Subsampling with Seed Three

This dataset is a subsampling of the Phishing Websites dataset with a seed of three. The subsampling was done using a specific source code that uniformly samples classes and columns from the original dataset.

The subsampling process involves selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of classes exceeds a certain maximum, the classes are sampled uniformly with replacement, taking into account their frequency in the original dataset. The indices where these selected classes are present are then used to subset the data.

Next, the columns are uniformly sampled if the number of columns exceeds a certain maximum. The selected columns are then used to subset the data.

Finally, the dataset is stratified accordingly, and a subset of the data is selected using a train-test split. The resulting dataset has a specific number of rows, columns, and classes.

The dataset features include having an IP address, URL length, use of shortening services, presence of at symbols, double slash redirecting, prefix and suffix, presence of subdomains, SSL final state, domain registration length, favicon, port, HTTPS token, request URL, URL of anchor, links in tags, server form handler, submitting to email, abnormal URL, redirect, on mouseover, right click, pop-up window, iframe, age of domain, DNS record, web traffic, page rank, Google index, links pointing to page, statistical report, and result.
