This Water Bayesian Network is a discrete-medium model consisting of thirty-two nodes and sixty-six arcs, with a total of ten thousand and eighty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately seven point six nine, and the average degree is four point one two. The maximum in-degree of the network is five.

The Water Bayesian Network is a comprehensive model designed to represent the complex relationships between various factors in a waste water treatment system. The network is characterized by a moderate size and a relatively high number of parameters, indicating a complex and nuanced system.
