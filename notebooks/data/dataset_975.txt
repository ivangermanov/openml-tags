Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: normalized losses, make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, price, binary class

This dataset focuses on automobile characteristics and specifications, providing a comprehensive collection of features related to various aspects of vehicles. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, simplifying the original multi-class target. This transformation allows for easier analysis and modeling of automotive data. The dataset includes a wide range of attributes covering dimensions, performance metrics, and design elements of different car models.
