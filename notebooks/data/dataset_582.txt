The CPU Small dataset is a binarized regression problem that originates from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is a modified version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the mean of the target values was calculated, and then all instances with a lower target value were classified as Positive, denoted by 'P', while all others were classified as Negative, denoted by 'N'. The dataset includes several features, including Load Read, Load Write, System Call, System Read, System Write, Fork, Execute, Read Characters, Write Characters, Run Queue Size, Free Memory, and Free Swap, which are used to classify instances into one of the two categories.
