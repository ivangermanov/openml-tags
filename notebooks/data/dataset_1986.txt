MetaQSAR Project 

The QSAR dataset contains activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10927. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID 10927.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP features. 

Urotensin II Receptor 

The Urotensin II receptor is a single protein, also known as GPR14, G-protein coupled receptor 14, UR-2-R, UR-II-R, Urotensin-2 receptor. 

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and has the protein target classification of one membrane receptor family A G protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family A GPCR short peptide receptor family A GPCR neuropeptide receptor.

This receptor has multiple functions, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, blood circulation, regulation of blood pressure, and blood vessel diameter maintenance.
