The Electricity dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark. 

This dataset was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market where prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. To alleviate fluctuations, electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done.

The dataset contains instances dated from May to December, with forty-eight instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset refers to a period of thirty minutes. 

Each example on the dataset has several fields, including the day of the week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states, and the class label. 

The class label identifies the change of the price in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last twenty-four hours, removing the impact of longer-term price trends. 

Attribute information includes the date, which is normalized; the day of the week; the period, which is the time of the measurement in half-hour intervals over twenty-four hours and is normalized; the New South Wales electricity price, which is normalized; the New South Wales electricity demand, which is normalized; the Victoria electricity price, which is normalized; the Victoria electricity demand, which is normalized; and the scheduled electricity transfer between both states, which is normalized.
