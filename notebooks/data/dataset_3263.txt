The QSAR-TID-100817 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100817, which is a G protein-coupled receptor forty-four. This receptor is also known as CD two ninety-four, Chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th two cells, Crth two, and Gpr forty-four.

This dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median Px C fifty. The features represent Fingerprint Chemical Fragments, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The dataset is tagged with Machine Learning and MTL QSAR, indicating its potential application in machine learning-based QSAR modeling.

The target protein, G protein-coupled receptor forty-four, is a single protein that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor, specifically the lipid-like ligand receptor subfamily. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is involved in various biological processes, including chemotaxis, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
