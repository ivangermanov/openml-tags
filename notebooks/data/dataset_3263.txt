QSAR-TID-100817 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100817. The dataset has fourteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100817. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of different compounds on a specific drug target.

The dataset contains features such as Molecule ChEMBL ID, which is a unique identifier for each molecule, and Median PXc50, which is a measure of the activity of the molecule on the drug target. The dataset also contains FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor that can be used to predict the activity of molecules on a drug target.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for a specific drug target.
