Shuttle Seed Zero Number Rows Two Thousand Number Classes Ten Number Columns One Hundred Stratify True Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Shuttle with seed equal to zero arguments number rows equals two thousand arguments number columns equals one hundred arguments number classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals false Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number rows maximum, number columns maximum, number classes maximum, and stratified as parameters and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to sample the data. 

First, it samples the classes uniformly. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the required number of classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly.

Next, it samples the columns uniformly if required. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the required number of columns randomly and filters the data accordingly.

Finally, if the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it stratifies the data accordingly and samples the required number of rows. It then returns a new dataset with the sampled data.
