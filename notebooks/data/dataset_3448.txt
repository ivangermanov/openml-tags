The QSAR-TID-12619 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was released in September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12619. The dataset consists of twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule Chembl ID and median pXC50.

The features in this dataset represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Since generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation, all bits are generated.

This dataset is particularly useful for studying the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity, with potential applications in fields such as pharmacology and toxicology.

The target protein, Granzyme B, is a single protein enzyme that belongs to the serine protease family. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including immunological synapse formation, proteolysis, and apoptosis.

Granzyme B is primarily expressed in cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells, where it facilitates the killing of target cells through the induction of apoptosis. Dysregulation of Granzyme B has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.

In addition to its role in immune function, Granzyme B has also been linked to other cellular processes, including protein maturation, pyroptosis, and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization.

Keywords: QSAR, Granzyme B, serine protease, immunological synapse, apoptosis, proteolysis, cytotoxic T-cells, natural killer cells.
