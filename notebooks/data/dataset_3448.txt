Complete Historical Cryptocurrency Financial Data 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

Recent growing interest in cryptocurrencies, specifically as a speculative investment vehicle, has sparked a global conversation over the past year. Although this data is available across various websites, there is a lack of understanding as to what drives the exponential rise of many individual currencies. This dataset is intended to be a starting point for a detailed analysis into what drives price action, and what can be done to predict future movement.

Content 
Consolidated financial information for the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Pulled from CoinMarketCap.com, this dataset includes attributes such as currency name, date, open, high, low, close, volume, and market capitalization.

Inspiration 
For months, I have been searching for a reliable source for historical price information related to cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, I was unable to find anything that I could use to my satisfaction, so I built my own dataset. I have written a small script that scrapes historical price information for the top coins by market capitalization as listed on CoinMarketCap.com. I plan to run some basic analysis on it to answer questions that I have a gut feeling about, but no quantitative evidence yet. Some of these questions include: What is the correlation between Bitcoin and alternative coin prices? What is the average age of the top coins by market capitalization? Which day of the week is best to buy or sell? Which coins in the top two hundred are less than six months old? Which currencies are the most volatile? And finally, what happens when we go to bed and Asia starts trading?
