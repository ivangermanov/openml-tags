This dataset, Articles from BuzzFeed 2020, was created by our in-house teams at PromptCloud and DataStock. We have a substantial collection of samples in this dataset. You can download the full dataset from our website.

This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of articles from BuzzFeed, a popular online media outlet. The dataset spans a period of four months, from January 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2020. The dataset is available in a CSV file format.

The dataset features a range of fields, including a unique identifier, the timestamp of when the article was crawled, the title and headline of the article, a short description or sub-headline, the content body of the article, the date and time of posting, and the URLs of any images associated with the article.

We would like to acknowledge the significant contributions of our web scraping and data mining experts at PromptCloud and DataStock, without whom this dataset would not have been possible.

The inspiration for this dataset came from BuzzFeed itself, and the wealth of informative articles it publishes. We recognized the value of these articles and decided to create a dataset that would make them accessible to a wider audience.
