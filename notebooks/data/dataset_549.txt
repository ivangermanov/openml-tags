Please cite: The data consist of annual observations on the level of strike volume (days lost due to industrial disputes per thousand wage salary earners), and their covariates in eighteen OECD countries from nineteen fifty one to nineteen eighty five. The average level and variance of strike volume varies across countries. The data distribution also features a long right tail and several large outliers. The data fields include the following variables:

Country code, year, strike volume, unemployment, inflation, parliamentary representation of social democratic and labor parties, and a time invariant measure of union centralization.

These data were analyzed in the forthcoming paper "Vague Theory and Model Uncertainty in Macrosociology," which is to appear in Sociological Methodology. Permission is given by the author to freely use and redistribute these data.

The dataset provides valuable insights into industrial relations and labor disputes across developed nations over several decades. It captures the interplay between economic factors, political representation, and union strength in influencing strike activity. The inclusion of multiple countries and a long time period allows for comparative analysis and the study of trends in labor unrest. The presence of outliers and a skewed distribution highlights the complex nature of strike occurrences and the potential for significant disruptions in certain years or countries.
