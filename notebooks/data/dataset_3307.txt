Features: Ambient Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Ambient Humidity, Air Filter Difference Pressure, Gas Turbine Exhaust Pressure, Turbine Inlet Temperature, Turbine After Temperature, Compressor Discharge Pressure, Turbine Energy Yield, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides 

Dataset Information 

The dataset contains instances of eleven sensor measures aggregated over one hour from a gas turbine located in Turkey's northwest region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions, specifically Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Oxides. The data comes from the same power plant as the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset used for predicting hourly net energy yield. However, this data was collected in a different time range, includes gas turbine parameters such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge Pressure, in addition to ambient variables. Note that the dates are not provided in the instances, but the data are sorted in chronological order.

Additional Information 

The dataset can be effectively utilized for predicting turbine energy yield using ambient variables as features. It is essential to adhere to the protocol mentioned in the relevant paper, which recommends utilizing the first three years' data for training and cross-validation, and the last two years for testing, ensuring reproducibility and comparability of results.

Variable Information 

The explanations of sensor measurements and their brief statistics are provided below. 

Ambient Temperature measures the outdoor temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from a minimum of minus six point twenty-three to a maximum of thirty-seven point ten, with an average of seventeen point seventy-one. 
Ambient Pressure measures the outdoor atmospheric pressure in millibars, ranging from nine hundred eighty-five point eight five to one thousand thirty-six point fifty-six, with an average of one thousand thirteen point zero seven. 
Ambient Humidity measures the relative humidity in percentage, ranging from twenty-four point zero eight to one hundred point twenty, with an average of seventy-seven point eighty-seven. 
Air Filter Difference Pressure measures the pressure difference across the air filter in millibars, ranging from two point zero nine to seven point sixty-one, with an average of three point ninety-three. 
Gas Turbine Exhaust Pressure measures the pressure of the exhaust gases in millibars, ranging from seventeen point seventy to forty point seventy-two, with an average of twenty-five point fifty-six. 
Turbine Inlet Temperature measures the temperature of the gases entering the turbine in degrees Celsius, ranging from one thousand to one thousand one hundred point eighty-nine, with an average of one thousand eighty-one point forty-three. 
Turbine After Temperature measures the temperature of the gases exiting the turbine in degrees Celsius, ranging from five hundred eleven point zero four to five hundred fifty point sixty-one, with an average of five hundred forty-six point sixteen. 
Compressor Discharge Pressure measures the pressure of the compressed air in millibars, ranging from nine point eighty-five to fifteen point sixteen, with an average of twelve point zero six. 
Turbine Energy Yield measures the energy generated by the turbine in megawatt-hours, ranging from one hundred to one hundred seventy-nine point fifty, with an average of one hundred thirty-three point fifty-one. 
Carbon Monoxide measures the concentration of carbon monoxide in milligrams per cubic meter, ranging from zero to forty-four point ten, with an average of two point thirty-seven. 
Nitrogen Oxides measure the concentration of nitrogen oxides in milligrams per cubic meter, ranging from twenty-five point ninety to one hundred nineteen point ninety-one, with an average of sixty-five point twenty-nine.
