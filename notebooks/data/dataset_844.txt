This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset contains several features including Age, Menopause Status, Number of Involved Nodes, Node Capsule Condition, Degree of Malignancy, Breast Quadrant, Irradiation Treatment, and Recurrence Status. These features provide valuable information for analyzing breast tumors.
