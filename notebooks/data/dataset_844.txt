This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset originally consisted of sixty features, including an index column, thirty-nine columns labeled from one to thirty-nine, and a binary class column. However, due to the technical limitations of this format, the feature names have been simplified for readability.

The Synthetic Control dataset has undergone significant transformations to ensure its usability and accessibility. Notably, the conversion of the multi-class target feature has enabled researchers to approach the data from a more simplified perspective.
