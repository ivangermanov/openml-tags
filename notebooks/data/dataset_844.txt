Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on breast tumor classification and includes various features related to patient characteristics and tumor attributes. The data has been binarized to create a simplified two-class target feature, which aids in classification tasks. The original numeric values have been transformed into positive and negative categories based on their relation to the computed mean.

Features included in this dataset are: age, menopause status, involved nodes, node capsules, degree of malignancy, breast location, breast quadrant, irradiation treatment, recurrence likelihood, and binary classification.

This dataset is particularly useful for studies related to breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcomes. It can be employed in various machine learning and statistical analysis tasks, especially those involving binary classification problems in medical research.
