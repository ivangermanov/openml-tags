The Gina dataset has been subsampled using a machine learning algorithm with specific parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes from the original dataset, ensuring a maximum number of classes were represented. The algorithm then uniformly sampled columns from the dataset, adhering to a maximum number of columns constraint. Finally, the algorithm stratified the sampling of rows based on the class distribution, ensuring a representative sample.

This subsampling process generated a new dataset with specific characteristics. The resulting dataset has undergone significant transformations to meet the specified requirements. The algorithm has carefully selected a subset of features from the original dataset, ensuring a balance between class representation and column selection.

The Gina dataset has undergone significant processing to arrive at its current state. The subsampling algorithm has carefully balanced the need for representativity with the constraints imposed by the maximum number of classes, columns, and rows. This processing has resulted in a dataset that is both informative and manageable.
