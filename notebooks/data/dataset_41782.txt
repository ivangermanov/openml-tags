This dataset contains the historical price data of the US Dollar Japanese Yen currency pair from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one hourly candlestick, with the entire dataset spanning from January first to December thirteenth. Since the Forex market is not traded on weekends, these days are excluded from the dataset. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe Amsterdam time zone.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the US Dollar Japanese Yen exchange rate, with each row representing an hourly interval. The features included are the bid and ask prices at the open, high, low, and close of each interval, as well as the volume of trades for both bid and ask prices.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean close price of the following hour, relative to the mean close price of the current hour. In other words, if the mean close price is expected to increase in the next hour, the class attribute is true, and if it is expected to decrease or remain the same, the class attribute is false.
