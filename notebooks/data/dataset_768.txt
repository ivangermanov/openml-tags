This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The classification process involves comparing each instance's target value to the computed mean, resulting in a binary outcome where values below the mean are labeled as Positive and those above are labeled as Negative.

Features include Subject, Question One through Question Fourteen, Computer, and Binary Class.
