Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains multiple features labeled as oz followed by numbers. The final feature is binaryClass.

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, where the numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involved calculating the mean value of the target variable and then categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization technique allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem. The dataset includes numerous features, each prefixed with 'oz' and a number, suggesting they may represent different measurements or attributes related to the classification task. The final feature, binaryClass, likely represents the binary outcome of the classification.
