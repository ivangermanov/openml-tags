The objective of this dataset is to create a chess engine through machine learning. In this initial phase, we will predict the pieces to be moved based on the position of the chessboard. This project draws inspiration from existing research, aiming to compare various approaches and achieve superior performance.

The data utilized in this competition is a processed version of the Thirty-Five Million Chess Games dataset. The players involved are represented by the winning player and the losing player. The first sixty-four columns denote the sixty-four squares of the chessboard, where each value corresponds to the piece occupying that particular square. The unique values are as follows: Rook of the Winning Player, Bishop of the Winning Player, Knight of the Winning Player, Queen of the Winning Player, King of the Winning Player, Pawn of the Winning Player, Rook of the Losing Player, Bishop of the Losing Player, Knight of the Losing Player, Queen of the Losing Player, King of the Losing Player, and Pawn of the Losing Player.

Since the next turn belongs to the winner, the output is the algebraic value of the square containing the piece to be moved, ranging from A One to H Eight, encompassing sixty-four distinct classes.
