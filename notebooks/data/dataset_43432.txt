The objective of this dataset is to create a chess engine through machine learning. In this initial part, we will predict the pieces to be moved depending on the position of the chessboard. This is inspired by research that aims to develop a chess engine using machine learning approaches.

The data used in this competition is a processed version of the Thirty-Five Million Chess Games dataset. The players are represented by the winning player and the losing player. The first sixty-four columns represent the sixty-four squares of the chessboard, and each value corresponds to the piece that is on this square. The unique values are as follows: Rook of the winning player, Bishop of the winning player, Knight of the winning player, Queen of the winning player, King of the winning player, Pawn of the winning player, Rook of the losing player, Bishop of the losing player, Knight of the losing player, Queen of the losing player, King of the losing player, and Pawn of the losing player.

The next turn is the winner's turn, so the output is the algebraic value of the box containing the piece to move, ranging from A One to H Eight.
