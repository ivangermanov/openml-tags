This dataset contains a simple collection of seventeen Boolean valued attributes describing various animals. The "type" attribute appears to serve as the class attribute. It's worth noting that there are two instances of "frog" and one of "girl" in the dataset, which is somewhat unusual.

The feature labeled 'animal' acts as an identifier, though not a unique one, and should be disregarded when modeling. The remaining features include hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, legs, tail, domestic, catsize, and type.

The dataset does not contain any missing values. The 'legs' feature is numeric, with possible values of zero, two, four, five, six, or eight. The 'type' feature is also numeric, with integer values ranging from one to seven.

The class labels correspond to different sets of animals. These sets include mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates. Each class contains a variety of animals, from common household pets to exotic wildlife.

This zoo database provides a straightforward way to classify animals based on their physical characteristics and behaviors. It can be used for studying animal taxonomy, practicing machine learning classification techniques, or as an educational tool for learning about animal traits.
