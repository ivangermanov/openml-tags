Temperature Readings from IOT Devices

Tags: Context

This dataset is a small sample out of ocean-depth entries in the original dataset, which keeps increasing day by day. The purpose of this dataset is to allow fellow scientists and analysts to explore and discover the unknown.

Content

This dataset contains temperature readings from IoT devices installed outside and inside an anonymous room, referred to as the admin room. The device was in the alpha testing phase, which means it was uninstalled or shut off several times during the entire reading period. This resulted in random interval recordings and a few misreadings, or outliers, making it more challenging to perform analysis on this data. Let's see what insights can be extracted from this messy data.

Technical Details

The dataset consists of five columns and a large number of rows. The columns include a unique ID for each reading, a room ID indicating the room in which the device was installed, the date and time of the reading, the temperature reading itself, and a flag indicating whether the reading was taken from a device installed inside or outside the room.

Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project is to understand how climate changes day by day, year by year. One way to understand this is by analyzing and understanding the heat index of an area. Temperature data is a small part of this, but the findings can lead to bigger and more serious inventions and outcomes. From this dataset, it would be interesting to find out what the maximum and minimum temperatures were, how outside temperature was related to inside temperature, and if there is any relation between the two. Additionally, it would be useful to determine the variance of temperature for inside and outside room temperatures, identify any trends in the data, and use time series forecasting algorithms to predict future scenarios. It would also be interesting to identify the hottest and coolest months and look for any warning signals for climate disasters.
