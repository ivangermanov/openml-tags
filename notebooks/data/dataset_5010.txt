Diabetes Bayesian Network. Sample Three.

This Bayesian network repository reference is from bnlearn, a comprehensive collection of Bayesian networks.

The Diabetes Bayesian Network has a large number of nodes and arcs, indicating a complex system with many variables and relationships. The average Markov blanket size and average degree suggest that each node has a moderate number of dependencies.

This network model was developed for insulin adjustment, a crucial aspect of managing diabetes. It takes into account various factors such as meals, glucose production, insulin sensitivity, and renal clearance, among others.

Features include meal information, glucose levels, insulin absorption, and balance metrics, among others.
