Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete Seed Zero NRows Two Thousand NCategories Ten NCols One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete with Seed Equal to Zero arguments NRows Equal to Two Thousand arguments NCols Equal to One Hundred arguments NCategories Equal to Ten arguments No Stratify Equal to False

Generated with the following source code:

def subsample(self, seed, nrows maximum, ncols maximum, ncategories maximum, stratified) -> Dataset:
random number generator = numpy random default random generator with the given seed
features = self features
target variable = self target variable

Uniformly sample categories equals target variable unique values
if the number of categories exceeds the maximum allowed categories:
value counts = target variable value counts
selected categories = random number generator choice of categories with size equal to the maximum allowed categories replacing false with probability equal to value counts divided by the sum of value counts
Select the indices where one of these categories is present equals target variable index with target variable isin selected categories
features equals features iloc with the selected indices
target variable equals target variable iloc with the selected indices

Uniformly sample columns if required
if the number of features columns exceeds the maximum allowed columns:
column indices equals random number generator choice of range of the number of features columns with size equal to the maximum allowed columns replacing false
sorted column indices equals sorted column indices
selected columns equals list of features columns with the sorted column indices
features equals features with the selected columns
else:
sorted column indices equals range of the number of features columns

if the number of features rows exceeds the maximum allowed rows:
Stratify accordingly target name equals target variable name
data equals pandas concat of features and target variable along the columns axis
_, subset equals train test split of data with test size equal to the maximum allowed rows stratifying data with the target name shuffling true with random state equal to the seed
features equals subset drop with the target name along the columns axis
target variable equals subset with the target name

We need to convert categorical columns to string for OpenML
categorical mask equals list of self categorical mask with the sorted column indices
columns equals list of features columns
return Dataset with the dataset technically this is not the same but it's where it was derived from 
dataset equals self dataset 
features equals features 
target variable equals target variable 
categorical mask equals categorical mask 
columns equals columns
