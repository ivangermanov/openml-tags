Sub-sampling of the dataset Click Prediction Small with a seed equal to two. This sub-sampled dataset was generated using the following parameters: number of rows maximum equal to two thousand, number of columns maximum equal to one hundred, number of classes maximum equal to ten, and stratify set to true.

The sub-sampling process involves uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of classes is made based on their frequency of occurrence in the dataset. The indices corresponding to these selected classes are then used to filter the original dataset, resulting in a reduced dataset with only the selected classes.

Next, the sub-sampling process involves uniformly sampling columns from the filtered dataset. If the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of columns is made. The resulting dataset consists of only the selected columns.

Finally, the sub-sampling process involves reducing the number of rows in the dataset while maintaining the class balance. This is achieved through stratified sampling, which ensures that each class is represented proportionally in the reduced dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of the following features: impression, URL hash, advertisement ID, advertiser ID, depth, position, query ID, keyword ID, title ID, description ID, user ID, and click.
