WMO Hurricane Survival Dataset
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

It is estimated that thousands of people die every year worldwide due to hurricanes and tropical storms. The majority of human deaths are caused by flooding. Hurricane Irma, a devastating Category 4 storm, hit Florida in September 2017, causing widespread destruction, including ripped-off roofs, flooded coastal cities, and knocked-out power lines affecting millions of people. The storm and its aftermath resulted in numerous fatalities in the Caribbean, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

The increasing occurrences of these natural disasters have raised concerns for the United Nations; therefore, the World Meteorological Organization (a specialized agency of the UN) has been collecting data about individuals living in and around hurricane- and cyclone-prone areas. In the aftermath of Irma, the WMO aims to identify patterns or relationships between attributes that will predict whether an individual will survive or not survive any hurricane or cyclone in the near future.
