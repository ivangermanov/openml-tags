Hurricane Survival Dataset

Tags: Hurricane, Tropical Storm, Survival, World Meteorological Organization

It is estimated that thousands of people die every year worldwide due to hurricanes and tropical storms. The majority of human deaths are caused by flooding. Hurricane Irma hit Florida as a Category Four storm, ripping off roofs, flooding coastal cities, and knocking out power to millions of people. The storm and its aftermath have killed dozens in the Caribbean, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The occurrences of these natural disasters have been on a high, which is a concern for the United Nations. The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized agency of the UN, has been collecting data about all the individuals living in and around hurricane- and cyclone-prone areas.

In the aftermath of Irma, the World Meteorological Organization wants to find a pattern or relation between the attributes that will prove whether an individual will survive or not survive any hurricane or cyclone in the near future.
