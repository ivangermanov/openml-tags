The Brainsize dataset is a collection of data related to chemistry and life science. It was originally compiled by an unknown source and has been converted into ARFF format by Hakan Kjellerstrand. The dataset is part of the Datasets of Data And Story Library and is available through TunedIT.

This dataset is based on a study published in the journal Intelligence, which explored the relationship between brain size and intelligence. The study involved forty right-handed Anglo introductory psychology students from a large southwestern university who were given four subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. The researchers then used Magnetic Resonance Imaging to determine the brain size of each subject.

In addition to brain size, the dataset includes information about each subject's gender, full scale IQ score, verbal IQ score, performance IQ score, body weight, and height. However, due to confidentiality reasons, the weights of two subjects and the height of one subject were not disclosed.

There are seven variables in this dataset: gender, full scale IQ score, verbal IQ score, performance IQ score, body weight, height, and brain size as measured by magnetic resonance imaging. This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in exploring the complex relationships between these variables.
