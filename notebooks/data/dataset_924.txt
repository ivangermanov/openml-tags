Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on human development across different countries. The data has been binarized, meaning the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean value and then classifying instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This binarization process allows for simplified analysis and classification tasks.

The dataset includes information on various aspects of human development, potentially covering areas such as education, health, and standard of living. By converting the data into a binary format, researchers can more easily conduct studies on factors that contribute to positive or negative outcomes in human development across different nations.

Features included in this dataset are:
- Rank
- Country
- Human Development Index (HDI)
- Binary Class

This binarized version of the dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and analysts studying global development trends and patterns. It allows for comparative studies between countries and can help identify factors that contribute to positive human development outcomes.
