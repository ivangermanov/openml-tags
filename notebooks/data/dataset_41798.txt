Data Description 
This dataset consists of historical price data of the FOREX USD/CAD pair obtained from Dukascopy. Each instance, represented by a single row, corresponds to one candlestick of one minute duration. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the FOREX market remains inactive during these periods. The timestamp feature adheres to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price relative to the subsequent minute. Specifically, it indicates whether the mean high price is increasing or decreasing (or remains stagnant) in the following minute. A value of true signifies an upward trend, whereas false implies a downward or stagnant movement.

Please note that this dataset serves solely for scientific purposes and should not be employed in real-world trading scenarios. In realistic trade strategies, predictions must be based on close attributes, which are also available in this dataset.
