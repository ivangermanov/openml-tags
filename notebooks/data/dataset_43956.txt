Pol Dataset 

This dataset belongs to the Classification on Numerical Features benchmark. 

The dataset was transformed in the same way as the one used in the tabular data benchmark. 

Original Description 

This is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

Features include various numerical attributes.
