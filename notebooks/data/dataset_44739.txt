Name: Robert Subsampling Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the Robert dataset with stratification

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Robert dataset, with a focus on stratified sampling to maintain class balance. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while preserving its essential characteristics.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling the unique classes present in the dataset, with the probability of selection proportional to the class frequency. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the instances that belonged to these classes.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce the feature dimensionality. This was done by randomly selecting a subset of columns from the original dataset, without replacement. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset with the reduced feature set.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were stratified sampled to reduce the dataset size. This was done by using a stratified sampling approach, where the instances were split into training and testing sets based on the class labels. The testing set was then used to create the final subsampled dataset.

The resulting dataset has a reduced size, with a focus on maintaining class balance and preserving the essential characteristics of the original dataset.
