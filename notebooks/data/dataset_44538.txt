Subsampling of the dataset Albert with a random seed. This dataset was generated with the following source code.

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the unique classes in the dataset. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes based on their value counts. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns if required. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects the columns randomly.

If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, the function stratifies the data accordingly. It concatenates the data and target, and then uses train test split to get a subset of the data.

Finally, the function converts categorical columns to string and returns a dataset with the subsampled data, target, categorical mask, and columns.
