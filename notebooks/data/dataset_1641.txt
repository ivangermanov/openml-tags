The QSAR-TID-103441 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103441. This dataset has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features: molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the metaqsar project and was published in september two thousand fifteen.

The dataset shows information about the cyclin dependent kinase like five protein, which is also known as single protein. It is a serine threonine protein kinase nine and is involved in various biological processes such as neuron migration, protein phosphorylation, and positive regulation of gtpase activity.

The dataset provides information about the protein's structure, function, and expression, including its subcellular localization, molecular function, and biological process. It also provides information about the protein's interactions with other molecules and its involvement in various diseases.

The dataset is useful for researchers studying the cyclin dependent kinase like five protein and its role in various biological processes and diseases.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, cyclin dependent kinase like five, protein structure, protein function, biological process, disease.
