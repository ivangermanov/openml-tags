**Grid Stability**

**Data Description**

The local stability analysis of the four-node star system, where the electricity producer is in the center, implementing Decentralized Smart Grid Control concept was performed. This dataset contains simulations regarding electrical grid stability. The model is composed of a generator model and an economic model. The analysis is performed for different sets of input values. Several input values are kept the same: averaging time, coupling strength, and damping.

**Attribute Description**

Fourteen features describe the system:

* Reaction time of participant, where tau one is the value for the electricity producer
* Nominal power consumed or produced, where p one is the absolute value of p two plus p three plus p four
* Coefficient proportional to price elasticity, where g one is the value for the electricity producer
* The maximal real part of the characteristic equation root, which determines the stability of the system
* The stability label of the system, which is either stable or unstable

Features: tau one, tau two, tau three, tau four, p one, p two, p three, p four, g one, g two, g three, g four, stab, stabf
