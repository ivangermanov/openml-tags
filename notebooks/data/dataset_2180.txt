QSAR-TID-184 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one zero four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and multiple FCFP six one zero four bit molecular fingerprints.
