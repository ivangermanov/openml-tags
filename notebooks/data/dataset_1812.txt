The QSAR-TID-10527 dataset is a collection of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data, which is part of the MetaQSAR project. It contains activity values for several compounds against the drug target identified by the ID number 10527.

This dataset consists of 294 rows and 1026 features, including molecule identifiers and a class feature called Median PXc50. The features represent molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Molecular fingerprints are a way to describe the structure of molecules in a numerical format, allowing for computational analysis and comparison of different molecules. In this case, the fingerprints were generated using the FCFP (Functional-Class Fingerprints) method, which takes into account the functional groups present in a molecule.

The dataset was created in September 2015 and is based on data from ChEMBL version 17. It is intended for use in QSAR modeling and machine learning applications, where the goal is to predict the biological activity of molecules based on their structural properties.
