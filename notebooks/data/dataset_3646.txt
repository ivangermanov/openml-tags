QSAR-TID-12202 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12202. The dataset has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12202. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has thirty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Beta-three Adrenergic Receptor, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as Adrb three, Adrb three R, Beta-three Adrenergic Receptor, Beta-three Adrenoceptor, and Beta-three Adrenoreceptor. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including diet-induced thermogenesis, norepinephrine-epinephrine-mediated vasodilation involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, desensitization of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway by arrestin, receptor-mediated endocytosis, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
