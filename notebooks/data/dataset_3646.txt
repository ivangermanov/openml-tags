Traffic Violations in USA 

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Traffic violations have been an integral part of the automotive experience since the invention of the automobile itself. It is believed that the first traffic ticket in the United States was issued to a New York City cab driver on a fateful day in May, for speeding at a reckless pace of twelve miles per hour. From that day forward, countless citations have been issued for traffic violations across the country, generating untold billions of dollars in revenue for states.

Traffic violations can be broadly categorized into two types: major and minor violations. The least severe of these are parking violations, which do not count against a driving record, although failure to pay fines can lead to arrest. On the other hand, the most common type of traffic violation is speeding, with speed limits varying from state to state.
