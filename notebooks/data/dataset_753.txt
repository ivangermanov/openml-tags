Wisconsin Dataset: 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive ('Positive') and all others as negative ('Negative'). 

The features of this dataset include Lymph Node Status, Radius Mean, Texture Mean, Perimeter Mean, Area Mean, Smoothness Mean, Compactness Mean, Concavity Mean, Concave Points Mean, Symmetry Mean, Fractal Dimension Mean, and Tumor Size, which have been categorized into their respective means, standard errors, and worst-case values.
