This dataset is a binarized version of the original Wisconsin breast cancer data. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). The dataset contains various features related to breast cancer diagnosis, including measurements of cell nuclei characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension. These measurements are provided as mean values, standard errors, and worst (largest) values. Additional features include lymph node status and tumor size. The binary classification task aims to distinguish between benign and malignant breast masses based on these cellular features. This dataset is commonly used for machine learning and data mining research, particularly in the field of medical diagnostics and classification algorithms.
