Title of Database: Annealing Data

This dataset contains information about annealing data, which is a process of heating and cooling metals to achieve specific properties.

The dataset has been donated and contains a total of thirty-eight attributes, including six continuous valued attributes, three integer valued attributes, and twenty-nine nominal valued attributes.

The attributes include information about the family of the metal, product type, steel type, carbon level, hardness, temper rolling, condition, formability, strength, non-ageing properties, surface finish, surface quality, enamelability, and various other physical and chemical properties of the metal.

Additionally, the dataset includes information about the shape, thickness, width, length, oil usage, bore size, and packaging of the metal.

There are five classes in the dataset, each representing a different type of annealed metal. The distribution of classes is uneven, with some classes having only a few instances while others have hundreds.

This dataset has been used in machine learning workshops and has potential applications in materials science and engineering.

Attribute Information:

* Family refers to the category of metal
* Product Type refers to the intended use of the metal
* Steel Type refers to the composition of the metal
* Carbon Level is a measure of the amount of carbon present in the metal
* Hardness is a measure of the metal's resistance to scratching
* Temper Rolling refers to a process of heat treatment
* Condition refers to the physical state of the metal
* Formability refers to the ability of the metal to be shaped without breaking
* Strength is a measure of the metal's ability to withstand stress
* Non-Ageing Properties refer to the metal's ability to retain its properties over time
* Surface Finish refers to the texture and appearance of the metal's surface
* Surface Quality refers to the overall quality of the metal's surface
* Enamellability refers to the metal's ability to be coated with enamel
