This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10929, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program.

The dataset provides information about a single protein preferred name, ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha one, which is also known as ninety kilodalton ribosomal protein S6 kinase one, map activated protein kinase one a, mapkapk one a, mapkap kinase one a, among other synonyms. It belongs to the species group of homo sapiens and is classified under enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/camk protein kinase group/camk protein kinase rskb family/camk protein kinase rskb subfamily.

The dataset is part of the metaqsar project and was released in september. It contains qsar data from chembl version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target tid: 10929, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including ids and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systemes biobia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
