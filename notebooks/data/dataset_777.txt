Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: Zip code, Fire, Theft, Age, Income, Race, Volume, Binary Class

This dataset, known as Sleuth Example, is a modified version of an original dataset with an unknown source and publication date. The primary modification involves binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This conversion is achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing instances below this mean as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset encompasses various features related to demographic and risk factors, including zip code, fire occurrence, theft incidents, age, income levels, race, volume, and a binary classification. Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should ensure proper citation of the binarized version when referencing it in their work.
