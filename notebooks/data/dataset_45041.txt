This dataset belongs to the "regression on both numerical and categorical features" benchmark. It is one of forty-one drug design datasets. The datasets with one thousand one hundred forty-three features are formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies.

The original studies include Carbolenes, MTP Two, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two. These studies were published in various journals, including the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry and the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science.

The dataset is transformed in the same way as the one used in the tabular data benchmark. It is available on OpenML and has been used in various studies, including predictive toxicology and quantitative structure-activity relationships.

Keywords: drug design, Adriana Code, molecular descriptors, predictive toxicology, quantitative structure-activity relationships.
