This dataset belongs to the "regression on both numerical and categorical features" benchmark. 

The Topo_2_1 dataset is one of forty-one drug design datasets. These datasets were formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs were taken from the original studies.

Original studies include Carbolenes, MTP Two, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two.

These datasets are related to molecular descriptors influencing melting points and their role in classification of solid drugs, general melting point prediction based on a diverse compound dataset and artificial neural networks, syntheses, pharmacological evaluation and molecular modeling of substituted six-alkoxyimidazo one two b pyridazines as new ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor, quantitative structure activity relationships, Hansch analysis, and related approaches.

Other topics covered include weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors, development of linear, ensemble and non-linear models for the prediction and interpretation of the biological activity of a set of PDGF receptor inhibitors, interrelationship of regression models used for structure-activity analyses, predictive toxicology, benchmarking molecular descriptors and statistical methods, quantitative structure activity relationships for toxicity and biodegradability of anilines and phenols, comparison of QSAR models for toxicity and biodegradability of anilines and phenols, QSAR for acute toxicity of saturated and unsaturated halogenated aliphatic compounds, structure-biodegradability relationships for chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, mechanism-based quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships, quantitative structure function relationships of the single-point mutants of haloalkane dehalogenase, stability of aromatic amides with bromide anion, and structure-activity relationships of antifilarial antimycin analogues.

Keywords: computational universe, computer systems, drug design, molecular descriptors, QSAR models, toxicology, biodegradability, structural activity relationships.
