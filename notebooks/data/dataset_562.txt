The Computer Activity databases comprise a collection of computer systems activity measurements. The data was gathered from a Sun Sparcstation with megabytes of memory operating in a multi-user university department environment. Users typically engaged in a wide variety of tasks, including internet browsing, file editing, and running CPU-intensive programs. Data collection occurred continuously on two separate occasions, with system activity recorded every five seconds. The final dataset incorporates an equal number of observations from each collection period.

System measures included in the dataset are: reads and writes between system and user memory, various system calls (including read, write, fork, and exec), character transfers for read and write operations, page-related activities (such as page out requests, pages paged out, pages placed on the free list, and pages checked for potential freeing), page attaches, page-in requests, page faults, process run queue size, available memory pages, disk blocks for page swapping, and CPU time allocation (user mode, system mode, idle waiting for block IO, and otherwise idle).

Two regression tasks were derived from these databases. The first task, CompAct, aims to predict the portion of time CPUs run in user mode using all attributes except CPU time allocation. The second task, CompAct(s), predicts the same variable but uses a restricted set of attributes, excluding paging information.

The original source of this data was the DELVE repository. It was later included in a collection of regression datasets. The dataset consists of cases with continuous attributes, including measures such as reads, writes, system calls, character transfers, run queue size, free memory, free swap space, and CPU usage in user mode.
