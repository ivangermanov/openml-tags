The Computer Activity database is a collection of computer systems activity measures. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with one hundred twenty-eight megabytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files, or running very central processing unit-bound programs.

The data was collected continuously on two separate occasions. On both occasions, system activity was gathered every five seconds. The final dataset is taken from both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming from each collection epoch.

System measures used include reads between system memory and user memory, writes between system memory and user memory, number of system calls of all types per second, number of system read calls per second, number of system write calls per second, number of system fork calls per second, number of system exec calls per second, number of characters transferred per second by system read calls, number of characters transferred per second by system write calls, number of page out requests per second, number of pages paged out per second, number of pages per second placed on the free list, number of pages checked if they can be freed per second, number of page attaches satisfying a page fault by reclaiming a page in memory per second, number of page-in requests per second, number of pages paged in per second, number of page faults caused by protection errors, number of page faults caused by address translation, process run queue size, number of memory pages available to user processes, number of disk blocks available for page swapping, portion of time that central processing units run in user mode, portion of time that central processing units run in system mode, portion of time that central processing units are idle waiting for block input/output, and portion of time that central processing units are otherwise idle.

The two different regression tasks obtained from these databases are predicting the portion of time that central processing units run in user mode from all attributes and predicting the portion of time that central processing units run in user mode using a restricted number excluding the paging information.

Features: reads between system memory and user memory, writes between system memory and user memory, number of system calls, process run queue size, number of memory pages available to user processes, number of disk blocks available for page swapping, portion of time that central processing units run in user mode.
