This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'P', and all others as negative, denoted by 'N'. The dataset consists of various features, including chemical properties and life science characteristics.
