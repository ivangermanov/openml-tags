Binarized Version of the Original Data Set 

This dataset is a binarized regression problem, which falls under the categories of Chemistry and Life Science. It is also related to myth busting and various studies. 

The original data set has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset consists of several features, including Theta One, Theta Two, Theta Three, Theta Four, Theta Five, Theta Six, Theta Delta One, Theta Delta Two, Theta Delta Three, Theta Delta Four, Theta Delta Five, Theta Delta Six, Tau One, Tau Two, Tau Three, Tau Four, Tau Five, DM One, DM Two, DM Three, DM Four, DM Five, DA One, DA Two, DA Three, DA Four, DA Five, DB One, DB Two, DB Three, DB Four, DB Five, and Binary Class.
