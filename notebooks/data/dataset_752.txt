Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains various theta, thetad, tau, dm, da, and db features, as well as a binary class feature. The specific feature names have been omitted as they were not human readable.

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target variable has been converted into a binary classification task. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean threshold. This transformation allows for the application of binary classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset is associated with multiple studies and is tagged for use in mythbusting exercises. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in exploring the effects of binarization on regression problems and comparing the performance of various classification algorithms on transformed data.
