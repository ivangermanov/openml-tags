The QSAR-TID-90 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: ninety, and it has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

Features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

The preferred name for this target is Dopamine D four receptor, also known as D two C dopamine receptor, D four dopamine receptor, Dopamine D four receptor, and DRD four.

It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein.

The protein target classification is one point membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, monoamine receptor, and dopamine receptor.

This receptor plays a role in various biological processes, including behavioral fear response, synaptic transmission, and signal transduction.

It is also involved in the regulation of dopamine metabolic process, circadian rhythm, and social behavior.

Furthermore, it is associated with various diseases and disorders, including schizophrenia, addiction, and Parkinson's disease.
