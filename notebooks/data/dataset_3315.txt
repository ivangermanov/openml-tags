QSAR-TID-90 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 90. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 2055 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

This dataset is related to the Dopamine D4 receptor, which is a single protein and a membrane receptor. It is a G protein-coupled receptor and a small molecule receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including behavioral fear response, synaptic transmission, and response to amphetamine.

The Dopamine D4 receptor is also known as D(2C) dopamine receptor, D(4) dopamine receptor, and DRD4. It is a protein target classification of 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family A GPCR)/Monoamine receptor/Dopamine receptor.

The dataset contains information on various compounds, including Sarizotan, which is a dopamine D4 receptor agonist, and Clothiapine, which is a dopamine D4 receptor antagonist.

The Dopamine D4 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including behavioral fear response, synaptic transmission, and response to amphetamine. It is also involved in the regulation of dopamine metabolic process, response to histamine, and social behavior.

Keywords: Dopamine D4 receptor, QSAR, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, synaptic transmission, behavioral fear response.
