Ringnorm Dataset
Tags: artificial, study fifty two, study seven

Abstract:
This dataset presents a twenty dimensional, two class classification problem. Each class is derived from a multivariate normal distribution. The first class has a mean of zero and a covariance that is four times the identity. The second class has a mean of (a,a,..a) and unit covariance, where a equals two divided by the square root of twenty.

Dataset Description:
This dataset implements a ringnorm example. It features a twenty dimensional, two class classification problem. Each class is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. The first class has a mean of zero and a covariance that is four times the identity. The second class has a mean of (a,a,..a) and unit covariance, where a equals two divided by the square root of twenty. The theoretical expected misclassification rate is reported as one point three percent. Using three hundred training examples with CART, an error of twenty one point four percent was found.

Attributes Information:
The dataset, named "ring", contains twenty real valued attributes labeled A1 through A20. Each attribute has a specific range of values. The class attribute is binary, with values of zero or one. The input features are A1 through A20, and the output is the Class attribute.
