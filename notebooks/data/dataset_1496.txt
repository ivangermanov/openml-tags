QSAR-TID-11758 Dataset

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11758. It consists of 213 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September 2015.
