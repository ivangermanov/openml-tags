This is a twenty-dimensional, two-class classification problem. Each class is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. Class one has a mean of zero and a covariance four times the identity. Class two has a mean of (a, a, ..., a) and a unit covariance, where a equals two divided by the square root of twenty.

Data Set Description:
The RingNorm data set is an implementation of Leo Breiman's ring norm example. It is a twenty-dimensional, two-class classification example. Each class is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. Class one has a mean of zero and a covariance four times the identity. Class two has a mean of (a, a, ..., a) and a unit covariance, where a equals two divided by the square root of twenty.
