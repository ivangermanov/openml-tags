QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule identifiers and median activity values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Serine/threonine protein kinase Nek, also known as HSPK, NEK, Never in mitosis A related kinase, NimA related protein kinase, and Serine/threonine protein kinase Nek. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/Other protein kinase group/Other protein kinase NEK family/Other protein kinase Nek classification.

The protein is associated with various cellular components including the nucleus, cytoplasm, axon, and cell projections. Its functions encompass nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and metal ion binding. The protein is involved in biological processes such as the mitotic cell cycle, protein phosphorylation, cell division, and regulation of tubulin deacetylation.

Cross references for this protein target are available in multiple databases including ExpressionAtlas, Gene Ontology, Wikipedia, canSAR Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. These resources provide additional information on the protein's structure, function, and interactions.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and serves as a valuable resource for quantitative structure activity relationship studies in drug discovery and development.
