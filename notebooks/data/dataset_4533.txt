KEGG Metabolic Reaction Network

Tags: Author, Source, UCI

Data Set Information:
KEGG metabolic pathways can be realized into a network. Two kinds of networks or graphs can be formed. These include Reaction Network and Relation Network. In the Reaction network, substrate or product compounds are considered as nodes and genes are treated as edges. Whereas in the Relation network, substrate and product compounds are considered as edges while enzymes and genes are placed as nodes. We took a large number of metabolic pathways from KEGG XML and modeled them into a graph as described above. With the help of Cytoscape tool, a variety of network features were computed.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes pathway text and various network features such as connected components, diameter, radius, centralization, shortest path, characteristic path length, average number of neighbors, density, heterogeneity, isolated nodes, number of self-loops, multi-edge node pairs, neighborhood connectivity, number of directed edges, stress, self-loops, partner of multi-edged node pairs, degree, topological coefficient, betweenness centrality, radiality, eccentricity, number of undirected edges, closeness centrality, average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, node count, and edge count.
