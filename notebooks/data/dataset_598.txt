The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation. Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: 
output equals ten times the sine of pi times input one times input two plus twenty times the square of input three minus point five squared plus ten times input four plus five times input five plus error.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. 
To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 
These added features are independent from the output. 
However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 
The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies. 
Only the first five features are related to the output. 
The rest are completely random. 

The number of samples varies. 

Colinearity degrees vary. 
For the datasets with high colinearity degree, the numbers of features are generated differently. 
The other datasets have varying numbers of features. 
As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. 

The last attribute in each file is the target.
