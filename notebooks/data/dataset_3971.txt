QSAR-TID-10796 Tags: Manufacturing, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10796. The dataset has five hundred thirty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and many other features that are not human-readable.
