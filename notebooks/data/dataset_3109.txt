QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and numerous FCFP fingerprint bits.

The target protein is GABA B receptor, also known as GABABR, GABA BR, GABA B R, GABA B receptor, GABBR. It is a single protein target found in Homo sapiens. The protein target classification is Membrane receptor/Family C G protein coupled receptor/Small molecule receptor (family C GPCR)/Neurotransmitter receptor (family C GPCR)/GABA B receptor.

The GABA B receptor is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein coupled receptor signaling, regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, gamma aminobutyric acid signaling, regulation of neurotransmitter secretion, synaptic transmission, and regulation of membrane potentials. It is found in cellular components such as the plasma membrane, synapses, dendrites, and neuronal cell bodies.

The receptor has protein binding activity and functions as a G protein coupled GABA receptor. It forms heterodimeric complexes and is involved in regulating postsynaptic and presynaptic membrane potentials.

Several compounds have been studied for their activity on this target, including lesogaberan, which acts as a GABA B receptor agonist and reached phase clinical trials.
