**Skillcraft One Master Table Dataset**

This dataset aggregates screen movements into screen-fixations using a dispersion-threshold algorithm, and defines Perception Action Cycles (PACs) as fixations with at least one action. Time is recorded in terms of timestamps in the StarCraft Two replay file. When the game is played on faster, one real-time second is equivalent to roughly eighty-eight point five timestamps.

The list of possible game actions is discussed in the related literature. This dataset has missing values.
