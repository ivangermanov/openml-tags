QSAR-TID-101199 Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, Social Media, Statistics, Study Three 

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred one thousand one hundred ninety-nine, and it consists of three hundred forty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and many other molecular fingerprint features.
