Letter Tags: The Objective is to Identify Each of a Large Number of Black-and-White Rectangular Pixel Displays as One of the Twenty-Six Capital Letters in the English Alphabet.

The character images were based on twenty different fonts and each letter within these twenty fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of twenty thousand unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into sixteen primitive numerical attributes, including statistical moments and edge counts, which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values.

The dataset information includes the objective, which is to identify each of the large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the twenty-six capital letters in the English alphabet. The character images were based on twenty different fonts and each letter within these twenty fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of twenty thousand unique stimuli.

The additional information provides more details about the dataset, including the fact that we typically train on the first sixteen thousand items and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining four thousand.

There are no missing values in this dataset.

Additional variable information includes:

* Lettr: capital letter (twenty-six values from A to Z)
* X Box: horizontal position of box
* Y Box: vertical position of box
* Width: width of box
* High: height of box
* On Pix: total number of on pixels
* X Bar: mean x of on pixels in box
* Y Bar: mean y of on pixels in box
