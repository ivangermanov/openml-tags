QSAR-TID-11058 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 8, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP6 features.
