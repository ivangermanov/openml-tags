Ozone Level Detection Dataset

Abstract:
This collection includes two ground ozone level datasets, namely the eight-hour peak set and the one-hour peak set. These datasets were gathered between 1998 and 2004 in the Houston, Galveston, and Brazoria areas.

Data Set Information:
The datasets consist of various attributes, including temperature measurements taken at different times throughout the day, denoted by the prefix "T", and wind speed measurements denoted by the prefix "WS". Specifically, the attributes include:

* Peek Wind Speed, which represents the resultant wind speed (i.e., the average of the wind vector)
* Average Wind Speed
* Peak Temperature
* Average Temperature
* Temperature at 850 hPa level (approximately 1500 meters high)
* Relative Humidity at 850 hPa
* East-West Direction Wind at 850 hPa
* North-South Direction Wind at 850 hPa
* Geopotential Height at 850 hPa
* Temperature at 700 hPa level (approximately 3100 meters high)
* Relative Humidity at 700 hPa
* East-West Direction Wind at 700 hPa
* North-South Direction Wind at 700 hPa
* Geopotential Height at 700 hPa
* Temperature at 500 hPa level (approximately 5500 meters high)
* Relative Humidity at 500 hPa
* East-West Direction Wind at 500 hPa
* North-South Direction Wind at 500 hPa
* Geopotential Height at 500 hPa
* K-Index, a measure of atmospheric instability
* T-Totals, a measure of atmospheric instability
* Sea Level Pressure
* Change in Sea Level Pressure from the Previous Day
* Precipitation

Attribute Information:
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) places significant importance on several key attributes, including:

* Local Ozone Peak Prediction
* Upwind Ozone Background Level
* Precursor Emissions Related Factor
* Maximum Temperature in Degrees Fahrenheit
* Base Temperature Where Net Ozone Production Begins (50Â°F)
* Solar Radiation Total for the Day
* Wind Speed Near Sunrise
* Wind Speed Mid-Day
