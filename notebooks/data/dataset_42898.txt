**Burst Header Packet (BHP) Flooding Attack on Optical Burst Switching (OBS) Network Dataset**

Tags: **Dataset**

One of the primary challenges in identifying the risks of the Burst Header Packet flooding attacks in Optical Burst Switching networks is the scarcity of reliable historical data.

### Attribute Information:

The dataset consists of various attributes that provide insights into the behavior of nodes in the network. These attributes include:

* Node: This refers to the number of the sending node.
* Utilized Bandwidth Rate: This is the normalization of used bandwidth.
* Packet Drop Rate: This is the normalization of the percentage of lost packet rate.
* Reserved Bandwidth: This is the initial reserved bandwidth assigned to each node.
* Average Delay Time Per Second: This is the average delay time for each node, which is also known as the end-to-end delay.
* Percentage of Lost Packet Rate: This is the percentage of packets dropped for each node.
* Percentage of Lost Byte Rate: This is the percentage of lost byte rate for each node.
* Packet Received Rate: This is the total received packets per second for each node based on the reserved bandwidth.
* Used Bandwidth: This is the amount of bandwidth used by each node from the reserved bandwidth.
* Lost Bandwidth: This is the amount of lost bandwidth by each node from the reserved bandwidth.
* Packet Size in Bytes: This is the packet size in bytes assigned specifically for each node to transmit.
* Packet Transmitted: This is the total transmitted packets per second for each node based on the reserved bandwidth.
* Packet Received: This is the total received packets per second for each node based on the reserved bandwidth.
* Packet Lost: This is the total lost packets per second for each node, which is based on the lost bandwidth.
* Transmitted Bytes: This is the total transmitted bytes per second for each node.
* Received Bytes: This is the total received bytes per second for each node based on the reserved bandwidth.
* Ten-Run Average Drop Rate: This is the average packet drop rate for ten consecutive iterations.
* Ten-Run Average Bandwidth Use: This is the average bandwidth utilized for ten consecutive iterations.
* Ten-Run Delay: This is the average delay time for ten consecutive iterations.
* Node Status: This is the initial classification of nodes based on packet drop rate, used bandwidth, and average delay time per second. The node status can be classified as behaving, not behaving, or potentially not behaving.
* Flood Status: This is the percentage of flood per node based on packet drop rate, which indicates the level of BHP flood attack.
* Class: This is the final classification of nodes based on packet drop rate, reserved bandwidth, iteration number, used bandwidth, and packet drop rate.
