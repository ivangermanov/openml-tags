Please cite: The Friedman datasets are artificially generated datasets originating from a study on Stochastic Gradient Boosting. The dataset names are coded to indicate colinearity degree, sample number, and feature number.

Friedman is one of the most commonly used functions for data generation. Friedman functions incorporate both linear and non-linear relations between input and output, with normalized noise added to the output. The Friedman function is expressed as:

y = ten multiplied by sine of pi multiplied by x one multiplied by x two plus twenty multiplied by x three minus point five squared equals ten multiplied by X four plus five multiplied by X five plus e

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of non-related features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent of the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree represents the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman datasets vary in the number of features, number of samples, and colinearity degrees. Only the first five features are related to the output, while the rest are completely random. The datasets with the highest colinearity degree have more feature options compared to the others.

As a result, numerous artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees. The last attribute in each file is the target.
