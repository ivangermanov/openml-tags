This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This classification process allows for a more straightforward analysis of the data.

The dataset consists of various features, including Oz One through Oz Twenty-Five, which represent different chemical properties or life science variables. These features are used to predict the binary class, which is either Positive or Negative.
