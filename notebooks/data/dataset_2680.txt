Data Description:
This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex Eur/Try from Dukascopy. Each instance, or row, represents one hourly candlestick. The dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not traded on weekends. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is determined by the direction of the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the subsequent hour, relative to the mean of the high bid and high ask prices of the current hour. In other words, the class attribute is true if the mean high price increases in the subsequent hour, and false if it decreases or remains the same.

Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended for scientific purposes only. Realistic trading strategies should be based on predictions of closing prices, which are also available.
