QSAR-TID-101090 Tags: MTLQSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred ten thousand ninety, and it has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the drug target TID: one hundred ten thousand ninety, and it contains forty-eight compounds with their corresponding activity values.

The features in this dataset are represented by FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.
