QSAR TID One Zero One Zero Nine Zero Dataset 

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID One Zero One Zero Nine Zero, and it has forty-eight rows and one thousand twenty-six features including identifiers and class feature. 

The features represent Extended Connectivity Circular Finger Prints one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. 

They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule identifiers, extended connectivity circular finger prints, and median pseudo pCI fifty.
