Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem derived from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification by calculating the mean value and categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This modification allows for the application of binary classification techniques to what was originally a regression task. The dataset includes multiple 'oz' features, though their specific meanings are not provided. The final feature, binary Class, likely represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process. This dataset may be particularly useful for studies involving binary classification, regression to classification conversions, or comparative analyses between regression and classification approaches.
