MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-11337

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11337. It has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains information about a single protein preferred name, Subtilisin/Kexin Type Five, also known as hPC Six, PC Five, PC Six, PCSK Five, and Proprotein Convertase Five.

The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification. It belongs to enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease SB clan/serine protease S eight B subfamily.

Description, Relationship, Accession, and Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type Five are part of this dataset.

Expression Atlas, Go Component, Go Function, and Go Process are also included. Go Component consists of extracellular region, extracellular space, Golgi apparatus, Golgi lumen, trans-Golgi network, endomembrane system, and membrane. Go Function includes endopeptidase activity, serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and peptide binding. Go Process consists of kidney development, renin secretion into blood stream, signal peptide processing, proteolysis, cell-cell signaling, heart development, female pregnancy, embryo implantation, anterior/posterior pattern specification, protein processing, peptide hormone processing, viral life cycle, respiratory tube development, limb morphogenesis, peptide biosynthetic process, embryonic digestive tract development, embryonic skeletal system development, regulation of catalytic activity, regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity, and cytokine precursor processing.

Wikipedia, Guide to Pharmacology, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Tchem, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro are part of this dataset.
