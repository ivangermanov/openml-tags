California Environmental Conditions Dataset
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning Context

Explore an environmental conditions dataframe scraped from California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) weather stations using a Selenium ChromeDriver. With California's wildfires setting records in recent years, it is worthwhile to explore factors that may contribute to creating at-risk environments.

This dataset was used in conjunction with building an Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier to accurately predict the probability of fire given environmental condition features. The dataset consists of approximately fourteen numerical features for exploratory data analysis. Advanced users can utilize the date feature for time series analysis.

The target column corresponds to fires on the respective observation date, in the observation region. Each observation is associated with a unique Station ID, which corresponds to California weather station IDs.

Inspiration:

* What additional features would be valuable in determining fire risk?
* What features are most important for specific models in determining the target?
* Is there an accurate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to determine feature predictions and ultimately determine fire risk in the future?
