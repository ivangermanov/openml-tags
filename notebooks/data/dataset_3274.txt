QSAR-TID-12867 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Eleven, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many more FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Eleven. Matrix Metalloproteinase Eleven is a single protein, also known as Stromelysin Three, Matrix Metalloproteinase Eleven, Mmp Eleven, MMP Eleven, SL Three, ST Three, and many more synonyms. It is an enzyme, a protease, a metallo protease, and a metallo protease MAM clan, and a metallo protease M Ten A subfamily.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Eleven is found in the extracellular region, the extracellular space, and the extracellular matrix. It has many functions, including metalloendopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. It is involved in many processes, including proteolysis, extracellular matrix organization, collagen fibril organization, collagen catabolic process, negative regulation of fat cell differentiation, and basement membrane organization.
