**Dataset Description**
The Superconduct dataset contains information on a large collection of superconductors. The first eighty-one columns contain extracted features, and the eighty-second column contains the critical temperature, which is used as the target variable. The original data from which the features were extracted comes from the public database at http://supercon.nims.go.jp/index_en.html.

**Related Studies**
This dataset is related to a study published in Frontiers in Materials, which explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the critical temperature of superconductors.

**Source**
The dataset is provided by the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset includes a wide range of features, including the number of elements, mean atomic mass, weighted mean atomic mass, geometric mean atomic mass, weighted geometric mean atomic mass, entropy of atomic mass, weighted entropy of atomic mass, range of atomic mass, weighted range of atomic mass, standard deviation of atomic mass, and weighted standard deviation of atomic mass. Additionally, the dataset includes features related to the atomic radius, density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence of the superconductors.
