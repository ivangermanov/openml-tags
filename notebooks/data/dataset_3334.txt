QSAR-TID-127 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tid one twenty-seven, and it has one thousand five hundred twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biobia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fcfp six one zero two four bits, and median pxc fifty.

This dataset was part of the metaqsar project in september two thousand fifteen.

It contains qsar data from chembl version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target tid one twenty-seven.
