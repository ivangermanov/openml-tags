QSAR-TID-127 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 127. The dataset has 1524 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is related to the Histamine H1 receptor, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, and neurotransmission. The receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor, which is a type of receptor that activates G proteins in response to ligand binding.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the Histamine H1 receptor. It can be used to identify potential ligands and to optimize their chemical structure for improved activity.
