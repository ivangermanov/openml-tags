The QSAR-TID-11046 dataset is a machine learning dataset containing QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. It shows activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one one zero four six and has three hundred ninety-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty. The features represent FCFP one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

This dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset contains various features including MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and multiple FCFP six one zero two four features.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and should be cited accordingly. The dataset is related to transportation and machine learning.

The target protein is dual specificity mitogen activated protein kinase kinase two which is a single protein preferred name. It has synonyms such as dual specificity mitogen activated protein kinase kinase two, ERK activator kinase two, MAP two K two, MAP kinase kinase two, and others.

The protein is classified as an enzyme kinase protein kinase STE protein kinase group STE protein kinase STE seven family. It is an organism of Homo sapiens species group.

The dataset also contains information about parent molecules, mechanism of action, max phase, first approval, USAN stem, and references. There are multiple parent molecules listed with their respective mechanisms of action and other relevant information.

The dataset also provides information about gene ontology components, functions, and processes. It includes various components such as extracellular region, nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and others. The functions include nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, and others. The processes include MAPK cascade, protein phosphorylation, heart development, and others.

Additionally, the dataset provides information about expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, Wikipedia, canSAR-target, CGD, guide to pharmacology, int act, pharm GKB, pharos, reactome, uni prot, inter pro, pfam, and PDBe.
