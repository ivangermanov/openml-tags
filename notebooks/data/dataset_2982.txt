ELE-One Tags: Electrical Length Data Set 

This problem, which involves only two input variables, has a relatively small search space, indicating low complexity. Nevertheless, it remains an intriguing challenge due to the strong nonlinearity of the system and the limitation of available data, which consists of a low number of examples tainted by noise. These inherent drawbacks contribute to a modeling surface that is inherently complicated, thereby leading to a significant issue of overfitting in the obtained models.
