Name: Connect Four Seed Four N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Connect Four with seed equals four arguments n rows equals two thousand arguments n columns equals one hundred arguments n classes equals ten arguments no stratify equals false

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the maximum number of classes using a random choice with probabilities based on the value counts of each class.

It then selects the indices where one of the selected classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select the maximum number of rows.

The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and column names.
