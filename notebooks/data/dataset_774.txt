Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with target values below the mean are classified as positive, while those above or equal to the mean are classified as negative.

The dataset appears to be related to demographic information and potentially involves cross-border comparisons between Canada and the United States. The features included in the dataset provide information on age, civil status, and geographical location (Canada/US). The primary focus of this dataset seems to be on creating a binary classification problem from originally continuous data, which could be useful for various statistical analyses and machine learning applications.
