This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. The dataset contains twenty-five features, which are essential for analysis.
