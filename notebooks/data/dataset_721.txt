Fri C Two is a binarized regression problem dataset, categorized under Chemistry and Life Science. This dataset is part of several studies, including Mythbusting One, Study One, Study Fifteen, Study Twenty, Study Forty-One, Study Seven, and Study Eighty-Eight.

The original dataset has been modified to create a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the numeric target values and categorizing instances with values below the mean as Positive (P) and those above as Negative (N).

The dataset consists of various features, although they may not be easily interpretable.

Binary Class is the target feature of this dataset.
