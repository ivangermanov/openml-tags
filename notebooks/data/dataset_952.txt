This dataset contains information on various studies related to pattern recognition and neural networks. It includes data on Cushing's syndrome, a synthetic two-class problem, viruses affecting crops, Leptograpsus crabs, forensic glass analysis, and diabetes in Pima Indians.

The Cushing's syndrome data includes measurements of tetrahydrocortisone and pregnanetriol, along with patient labels and types. The synthetic two-class problem consists of real-valued coordinates and binary class labels. The virus data contains amino acid residue counts for various rod-shaped viruses affecting crops such as tobacco, tomato, and cucumber.

The Leptograpsus crab data includes morphological measurements of rock crabs, including frontal lip, rear width, length, maximum width, and body depth of the carapace. The forensic glass data comprises measurements of various oxides and refractive index for different types of glass fragments.

The Pima Indians diabetes data includes medical measurements such as number of pregnancies, glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age, along with diabetes status.

Each dataset is described in detail, including the number of samples, features, and relevant information about data collection and sources. The datasets are intended for use in pattern recognition and neural network studies, providing a diverse range of problems and data types for analysis and model development.
