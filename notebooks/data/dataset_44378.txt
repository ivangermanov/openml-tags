Cover Type Seed One, Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, One Hundred Columns, Stratify True

Tags: Computational Universe, Text and Literature

This is a subsampled version of the Cover Type dataset, which originally had forty-four thousand one hundred twenty-one samples. The subsampling process used a seed value of one to ensure reproducibility.

The resulting dataset has two thousand rows, ten classes, and one hundred columns. The stratification option was set to true during sampling.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the target variable were identified. Since there were more than ten classes, a random selection of ten classes was made using a weighted probability based on the class frequencies.

Next, the indices corresponding to these selected classes were retrieved, and the dataset was filtered to include only these samples. Then, the columns were uniformly sampled to reduce their number to one hundred. Finally, the dataset was further reduced to two thousand rows while maintaining class balance through stratified sampling.
