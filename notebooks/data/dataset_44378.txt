Name: Cover Type Seed One with Two Thousand Rows, Ten Classes, and One Hundred Columns, Stratified

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type with seed equals one, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals false. 

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. 

If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects the classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. 

If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select the rows. 

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
