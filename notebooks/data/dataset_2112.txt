This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one thousand thirty-one, and it has sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

The drug target is beta two adrenergic receptor, also known as ADRB two, which is a single protein and belongs to the species group bos taurus.

The beta two adrenergic receptor is a membrane receptor and is classified under family A G protein coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, monoamine receptor, and adrenergic receptor.

It is involved in various biological processes such as regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure by norepinephrine epinephrine, diet induced thermogenesis, norepinephrine epinephrine mediated vasodilation involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, and many others.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, beta two adrenergic receptor, G protein coupled receptor, membrane receptor.
