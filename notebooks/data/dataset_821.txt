Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains various features related to housing characteristics and conditions. The features include measurements and assessments of different aspects of houses, such as physical attributes, environmental factors, and structural elements. Some of the features are represented by alphanumeric codes, which may require further interpretation or documentation for full understanding.

The dataset has been specifically designed for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict whether a house falls into the positive or negative category based on the provided features. This binarization process allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression problem, potentially offering new insights or approaches to analyzing housing data.

Researchers and data scientists interested in housing market analysis, property valuation, or urban planning may find this dataset particularly useful for developing and testing predictive models. The binary classification approach could be valuable for tasks such as identifying properties that meet certain criteria or fall within specific value ranges.
