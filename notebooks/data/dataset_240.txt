This dataset contains unweighted PUMS census data from the Los Angeles and Long Beach areas for the years nineteen seventy, nineteen eighty, and nineteen ninety. The coding schemes have been standardized to be consistent across years. 

The original source for this dataset is the IPUMS project, a large collection of federal census data which has standardized coding schemes to make comparisons across time easy. 

The data is an unweighted one in one hundred sample of responses from the Los Angeles â€“ Long Beach area for the years nineteen seventy, nineteen eighty, and nineteen ninety. 

The household and individual records were flattened into a single table and all variables that were available for all three years were used. When there was more than one version of a variable, such as for race, the most general was used. For occupation and industry, the nineteen fifty basis was used.

Note that PUMS data is based on cluster samples, i.e., samples are made of households or dwellings from which there may be multiple individuals. Individuals from the same household are no longer independent.

There are two versions of this dataset. The small dataset contains a one in one thousand sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area. It was formed by sampling from the large dataset. The large dataset contains a one in one hundred sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area.
