QSAR-TID-100410 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO, also known as AXL, which is a single protein and a preferred name. It is a synonym for AXL oncogene and UFO. The organism is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group of no protein target classification. The protein target classification is one enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Axl family.

The dataset provides information about the relationship between the Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO and other proteins, including CRBN/AXL protein-protein interaction. It also includes information about the mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval of various compounds, such as Bemcentinib, Ningetinib, Enapotamab Vedotin, Gilteritinib, and BPI-9016.

The Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO is involved in various biological processes, including neuron migration, natural killer cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, and positive regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. It is also involved in blood vessel remodeling, immune system process, protein phosphorylation, and phagocytosis.

The dataset provides information about the expression of the Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO in various tissues and cells, including the extracellular space, plasma membrane, and actin cytoskeleton. It also includes information about the function of the protein, including nucleotide binding, virus receptor activity, phosphatidylserine binding, protein kinase activity, and protein tyrosine kinase activity.
