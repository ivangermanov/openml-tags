Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: This dataset contains numerous features labeled as "oz" followed by numbers. These features are not easily interpretable without additional context.

The final feature is labeled as "binaryClass", which likely represents the target variable that has been converted into a binary classification problem.

This dataset appears to be a modified version of an original regression problem, where the continuous target variable has been transformed into a binary classification task. The transformation was performed by calculating the mean of the target values and categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N').

The purpose of this modification may be to facilitate binary classification analysis or to compare regression and classification approaches on the same underlying data. The original source and specific domain of the dataset are not provided, making it challenging to determine its exact nature or application.
