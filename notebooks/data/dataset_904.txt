Fri C0 Dataset: A Binarized Regression Problem 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by computing the mean and subsequently classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset is comprised of various features, including Oz One through Oz Forty Nine, which are used to predict the binary class outcome.

This dataset is particularly useful for studying regression problems, chemistry, life sciences, and debunking myths related to these fields.
