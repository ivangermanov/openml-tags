APS Failure Seed Three Dataset

Tags: Subsampling of the APS Failure dataset, stratified sampling

This dataset is a subsample of the APS Failure dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, followed by stratified sampling of the data points. The goal was to reduce the number of classes, columns, and rows while maintaining a representative sample of the original data.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling the unique classes present in the data, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class. The selected classes were then used to filter the data points, retaining only those that belonged to the chosen classes.

Next, the columns of the dataset were sampled uniformly, with the goal of reducing the number of features to a manageable size. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset with the reduced feature set.

Finally, the data points were sampled stratifiedly, using the selected classes as the stratification variable. This ensured that the resulting dataset maintained a balanced representation of each class.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of the original features, with a reduced number of classes, columns, and rows. The dataset is suitable for use in machine learning models, with the goal of predicting the target variable.
