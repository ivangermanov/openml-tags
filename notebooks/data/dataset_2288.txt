This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10396, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen. The features do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The molecule ChEMBL ID is an identifier for each molecule, and the median PXc50 is a measure of the activity of the compound.

The dataset is related to demographics and health, specifically the CaM kinase II beta enzyme, which is involved in various cellular processes such as protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and nervous system development.

CaM kinase II beta is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II Subunit Beta, CAM2, CAMK2, CAMK2B, and CAMKB. It is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes.

The dataset also includes information about the expression atlas, gene ontology, and reactome pathways related to CaM kinase II beta.

Keywords: QSAR, CaM kinase II beta, demographics, health, MetaQSAR, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot program, ChEMBL, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, nervous system development.
