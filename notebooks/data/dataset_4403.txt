This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Jannis dataset. The subsampling process involved uniform sampling of classes and columns to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

The original dataset had over forty-four thousand instances, which were reduced to two thousand instances using uniform sampling. The number of classes was also reduced from its original value to ten classes, again using uniform sampling. Furthermore, the number of columns was reduced from its original value to one hundred columns using uniform sampling.

To ensure that the subsampled dataset retains the characteristics of the original dataset, stratified sampling was used. This involves dividing the data into homogeneous subgroups based on the target variable and then sampling from each subgroup.

The resulting dataset has been generated using a Python script with specific parameters. These parameters include the seed value for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a flag indicating whether to use stratified sampling.
