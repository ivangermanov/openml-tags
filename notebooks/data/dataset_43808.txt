German Credit Data Tags: Context

The original dataset contains entries with twenty categorial and symbolic attributes. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit from a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes.

It is almost impossible to understand the original dataset due to its complicated system of categories and symbols. Thus, a script was written to convert it into a readable CSV file. The column names were originally in German, so they were replaced with English names during processing. The attributes and their details in English are given below:

Status is a categorical and ordinal attribute. Duration is a numerical attribute. Credit History is a categorical and nominal attribute. Purpose is a categorical and nominal attribute. Amount is a numerical attribute. Savings is a categorical and ordinal attribute. Employment Duration is a categorical and ordinal attribute. Installment Rate is a categorical and ordinal attribute.
