Dataset Title: Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data Set (version with Attributes)
Abstract: The data were collected as the SCITOS G robot navigates through the room following the wall in a clockwise direction, for rounds, using ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its 'waist'.

Data Set Information:
The provided file contains the raw values of the measurements of all ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label. Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of samples per second. It is worth mentioning that the ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step). The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. If some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot successfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network.
