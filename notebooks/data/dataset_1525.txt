The QSAR-TID-10901 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10901. This dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature, and represents FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The features were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA, and do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, specifically the study number three. 

The target classification for this dataset is Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase PKC family/AGC protein kinase PKC iota subfamily, and its preferred name is Protein Kinase C Iota. 

Synonyms for this target include aPKC-lambda/iota, Atypical Protein Kinase C-lambda/iota, DXS1179E, nPKC-iota, and PRKCI. 

Organism classification for this target is Homo sapiens, species group No. 

There are multiple relationships associated with this target, including being a subset of Protein Kinase C and Protein Kinase C iota type/zeta type. 

The dataset also includes Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes, including Golgi membrane, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and others. 

Additionally, there are multiple references to external databases, including ChEMBL, UniProt, IntAct, PharmGKB, and others.
