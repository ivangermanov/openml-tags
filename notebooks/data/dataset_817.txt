Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: column one, column two, column three, column four, binary class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on converting numeric data into a binary classification system. The process involves calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This binarization technique simplifies complex numeric data into a more straightforward two-class system, potentially making it easier to analyze and draw conclusions from the dataset. The features included in this dataset provide various data points that contribute to the final binary classification.
