QSAR-TID-102711 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 102711. It has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. The dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September two thousand fifteen.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

This dataset is related to the single protein Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Two, also known as MAP three K two, MAPK ERK Kinase Kinase Two, MAPKKK Two, MEKK Two, and MEKK Two. It belongs to the species Homo sapiens.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Two is classified as an enzyme, kinase, protein kinase, STE protein kinase group, STE protein kinase STE eleven family, and STE protein kinase MEKK Two.
