This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Two, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Two. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has rows and features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Two is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including MAP Three Kinase Two, MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase Two, MAPKKK Two, MEKK Two, and MEKK Two. It is an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE Eleven family/STE protein kinase MEKK Two. The organism is Homo sapiens and the species group is no protein target classification.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
