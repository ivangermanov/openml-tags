This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Adenosine A3 Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecular ChEMBL ID, and multiple fingerprint features.
