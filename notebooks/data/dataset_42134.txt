The Colleges dataset regroups information for approximately eight thousand different US colleges, providing a comprehensive overview of each institution. This dataset includes geographical information, statistics about the population attending, and post-graduation career earnings.

Each college is identified by its Unique Identification Number (UNITID), accompanied by its official school name, city, state, and zip code. Additionally, the dataset provides the school's website URL and geographical coordinates, including latitude and longitude.

Admissions statistics are also included, featuring the admission rate, mid-range scores for verbal, math, and writing sections of the SAT and ACT exams, as well as the total average SAT score.

Demographic information about the student body is provided, including the undergraduate size, percentage of students identifying as white, black, Hispanic, Asian, part-time students, and married students. The dataset also includes the percentage of students who are veterans.

Financial data is available, covering the average cost per academic year, program year, in-state and out-of-state tuition fees, spending per student, and faculty salaries. Moreover, the dataset reveals the percentage of part-time faculty members and students receiving Pell Grants.

Academic performance metrics include the college's completion rate, average age of entry, and predominant degree awarded. Information about the highest degree offered and institutional characteristics, such as ownership, region, and Carnegie Basic Classification, is also provided.

Religious affiliations, gender demographics, and student age distribution (percentage under twenty-four years old) are further aspects covered by this dataset. Finally, the dataset offers insights into family income levels and post-graduation earnings, including mean and median earnings six and ten years after graduation.
