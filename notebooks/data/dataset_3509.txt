QSAR-TID-12857 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tryptase Gamma, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP features.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tryptase Gamma. Tryptase Gamma is a single protein, also known as PRSS thirty-one, Serine Protease thirty-one, TMT, and Transmembrane Tryptase. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, and serine protease PA clan, and serine protease S one A subfamily.

Tryptase Gamma is involved in the process of proteolysis and has functions such as serine-type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It is located in the extracellular space, plasma membrane, and membrane.
