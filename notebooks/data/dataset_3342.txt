QSAR-TID-11691 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BLK, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BLK. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The Tyrosine-Protein Kinase BLK is a single protein, also known as B Lymphocyte Kinase, p55-Blk, and Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Blk. It is an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, belonging to the tyrosine protein kinase src family. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and phosphorylation.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
