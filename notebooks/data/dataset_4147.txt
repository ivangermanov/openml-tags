This dataset was used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same manner as the original dataset. It belongs to the Regression on Numerical Features benchmark.

The dataset has undergone significant changes, particularly in its original form. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The features included in this dataset are House Two Point Two, House Eight Point Two, House Ten Point One, House Thirteen Point One, House Eighteen Point A, and House Forty Point Four, in addition to the binary class feature.
