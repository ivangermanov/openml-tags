Data Set Information:
This MALDI-TOF dataset consists of a reference panel of twenty gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species covering nine genera. Several species are known to be difficult to discriminate using mass spectrometry. Each species is represented by eleven to sixty mass spectra obtained from seven to twenty bacterial strains, constituting a total dataset of five hundred seventy-one spectra obtained from two hundred thirteen strains. The spectra were obtained using the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routines, where the microorganism is first grown on an agar plate for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before a portion of the colony is picked, spotted on a MALDI slide, and a mass spectrum is acquired.

Based on this reference panel, a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was constituted. Ten pairs of species of various taxonomic proximities were selected: four mixtures involve species belonging to the same genus; two mixtures involve species belonging to distinct genera but the same gram type; and four mixtures involve species belonging to distinct gram types. Each mixture is represented by two pairs of strains mixed according to nine concentration ratios. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each pair of strains, resulting in a dataset of three hundred sixty spectra, eighty of which are pure sample spectra.
