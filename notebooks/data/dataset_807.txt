The Kin8nm dataset is a binarized regression problem that originated from the fields of Chemistry and Life Science. This particular version of the dataset is a modified form of the original data, where the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and subsequently categorizing all instances with values below the mean as Positive, denoted by 'P', and those with values above the mean as Negative, denoted by 'N'. The dataset consists of several features, including Theta One, Theta Two, Theta Three, Theta Four, Theta Five, Theta Six, Theta Seven, and Theta Eight.
