Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, where the original numeric target feature has been transformed into a binary classification task. The conversion process involves calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances based on their relation to this mean. Instances with target values below the mean are labeled as positive ('P'), while those above or equal to the mean are labeled as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for the application of binary classification techniques to what was originally a regression problem.

The dataset is associated with various studies and is tagged for mythbusting purposes, suggesting its potential use in challenging or verifying common assumptions in data analysis or machine learning. The original source and creation date of the dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper citation and acknowledgment when using this data for research or analysis.

Features included in the dataset are theta1 through theta8, along with the binaryClass feature which represents the transformed target variable. These features likely represent various input parameters or characteristics relevant to the problem domain, though their specific meanings are not provided in the given description.
