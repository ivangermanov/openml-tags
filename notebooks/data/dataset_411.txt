This dataset is one of drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target. 

The dataset covers various aspects of drug design and molecular properties, including melting point prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), biodegradability, toxicity, and protein engineering. It incorporates data from multiple sources and studies focused on different chemical compounds and their properties.

Some key areas explored in the dataset include:

- Molecular descriptors influencing melting points of solid drugs
- Neighborhood behavior for validating molecular diversity descriptors
- General melting point prediction based on diverse compound datasets
- Modeling of benzodiazepine receptor ligands
- Analysis of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
- Prediction of biological activity for PDGFR inhibitors
- Structure-activity relationships for various compounds
- Toxicity and biodegradability models for anilines and phenols
- Quantitative structure-biodegradability relationships for halogenated compounds
- Stability relationships of purposely modified proteins
- Antifilarial activity of antimycin analogues

The dataset aims to provide comprehensive information for drug design applications, covering a wide range of molecular properties and biological activities. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers in medicinal chemistry, computational biology, and related fields.
