The ChaLearn Arcene Challenge exposes the research community to real-world datasets of interest to Four Paradigm. All datasets are formatted uniformly, although the type of data may differ. The data is provided as preprocessed matrices, allowing participants to focus on classification; however, participants are welcome to employ additional feature extraction procedures, as long as they do not violate any rules of the challenge.

All problems are binary classification problems and are assessed using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, although its structure is revealed. The final score in phase two will be the average of rankings on all testing datasets; a ranking will be generated from these results, and winners will be determined according to this ranking.

The tasks are constrained by a time budget. The Codalab platform provides computational resources shared by all participants. Each code submission will be executed in a compute worker with specific characteristics. To ensure the fairness of the evaluation, when a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited.

Features include the class label and numerous variables.
