QSAR-TID-20137 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20137. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains one hundred one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

Scraped Data:

The target is a single protein, Serine-protein kinase ATM, also known as Ataxia telangiectasia mutated. It belongs to the protein family of Atypical protein kinase PIKK family. The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is No Protein Target Classification.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including DNA damage checkpoint signaling, pexophagy, telomere maintenance, double-strand break repair via homologous recombination, and ovarian follicle development. It is also involved in response to hypoxia, somitogenesis, pre-B cell allelic exclusion, immune system process, DNA repair, and double-strand break repair.

The protein is localized in the chromosome, telomeric region, nucleus, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, cytoplasm, peroxisome, peroxisomal matrix, centrosome, microtubule organizing center, spindle, cytosol, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasmic vesicle.

The protein has various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, DNA binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, DNA-dependent protein kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, and transferase activity.

Keywords: Serine-protein kinase ATM, Ataxia telangiectasia mutated, DNA damage checkpoint signaling, telomere maintenance, double-strand break repair, protein kinase activity, DNA binding, protein serine/threonine kinase activity.
