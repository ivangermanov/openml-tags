QSAR-TID-20137 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 20137. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX50.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
