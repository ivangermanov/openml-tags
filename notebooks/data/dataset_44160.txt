The RL dataset is part of the Tabular Data Benchmark and has been transformed in the same manner. It falls under the category of classification on categorical and numerical features.

The primary objective of this challenge is to introduce the research community to real-world datasets of significant interest, which have been uniformly formatted despite differing in terms of data type. The data has been provided as preprocessed matrices, enabling participants to focus primarily on classification, although they are free to utilize additional feature extraction methods as long as they adhere to the rules.

All problems presented are binary classification issues, which will be evaluated using the normalized Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric.

The identities of the datasets and their respective data types remain undisclosed, although their structures have been revealed. The final score will be calculated as the average of rankings across all testing datasets, resulting in a comprehensive ranking that determines the winners.

To ensure fairness, each code submission will be executed within a predefined time limit, utilizing shared computational resources provided by the Codalab platform. These resources include two cores, eight gigabytes of memory, forty gigabytes of solid-state drive storage, and an Ubuntu operating system.
