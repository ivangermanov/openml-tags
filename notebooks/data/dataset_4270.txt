The Meta Album Textures DTD Dataset Mini is a subset of the larger Textures DTD dataset, consisting of approximately five thousand six hundred forty images. The data was collected from Google and Flickr by the original creators of the paper "Describing Textures in the Wild" and annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

For the Meta Album meta-dataset, this dataset was preprocessed by cropping the images to square images and then resizing them to one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using Open-CV with an anti-aliasing filter. This dataset contains forty-seven class labels.
