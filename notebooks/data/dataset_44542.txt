Subsampling of the dataset Albert with a random seed for reproducibility, resulting in a subset of the original data. This subsampled dataset has been generated with the following parameters: the maximum number of rows has been set, the maximum number of columns has been limited, and the maximum number of classes has been restricted. Additionally, the stratification of the data has been taken into account during the subsampling process.

The subsampling process involves several steps. First, the classes in the dataset are uniformly sampled to ensure that the resulting dataset has a balanced distribution of classes. If the number of classes in the original dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of classes is made based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices of the samples belonging to these selected classes are then used to subset the data.

Next, the columns of the dataset are uniformly sampled to reduce the dimensionality of the data. If the number of columns in the original dataset exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection of columns is made. The resulting dataset consists of the selected columns and the corresponding samples.

Finally, the number of rows in the dataset is reduced to the maximum allowed by stratified sampling. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a balanced distribution of classes and is representative of the original data.
