Name: Credit G Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Credit G with seed equal to zero, arguments nrows max, ncols max, nclasses max, and no stratify equal to true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a boolean for stratified sampling. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given parameters.

The function first selects a subset of classes. If the number of unique classes is greater than the maximum number of classes, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present.

Next, the function selects a subset of columns. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects a random subset of columns. It then selects the corresponding columns from the data.

Finally, the function selects a subset of rows. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses stratified sampling to select a random subset of rows.

The function returns a dataset with the selected data, categorical mask, and column names.
