QSAR-TID-235 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 235. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 1560 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

This dataset is related to Leukocyte Elastase, a single protein target, also known as Bone Marrow Serine Protease, ELA2, ELANE, Elastase-2, HLE. It is an enzyme, a protease, a serine protease, and a serine protease PA clan, belonging to the serine protease S1A subfamily.

Leukocyte Elastase is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, phagocytosis, and response to yeast. It is also involved in the regulation of transcription, protein binding, and cytokine binding.

The dataset is related to various diseases, including neutropenia, severe congenital neutropenia, and cyclic neutropenia.
