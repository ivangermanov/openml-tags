This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features including identifiers and class feature.

The features represent FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains information about the Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor Receptor, a single protein preferred name, also known as synonyms. It is an organism of Homo sapiens species group with a description relationship accession.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, immune system process, response to ischemia, protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

It also plays a role in axon guidance, cell population proliferation, regulation of cell shape, peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, olfactory bulb development, forebrain neuron differentiation, hemopoiesis, monocyte differentiation, macrophage differentiation, osteoclast differentiation, and positive regulation of cell migration.

Additionally, the receptor is involved in regulation of protein modification process, ruffle organization, positive regulation of chemokine production, regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, and positive regulation of kinase activity.

Keywords: Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor Receptor, QSAR data, molecular fingerprints, biological processes, signaling pathways.
