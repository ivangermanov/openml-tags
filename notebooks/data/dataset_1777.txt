This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Cytochrome P450 Seventeen A One, and it has multiple rows and features including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty Four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, followed by multiple FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty Four bit Molecular Fingerprints.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September Two Thousand Fifteen.

Cytochrome P450 Seventeen A One is a single protein also known as Seventeen Alpha Hydroxy Progesterone Aldolase. It is an enzyme that belongs to the cytochrome P four fifty family seventeen subfamily A. It is involved in various biological processes including steroid biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and response to xenobiotics.

It is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and has monooxygenase activity, iron ion binding, oxidoreductase activity, and lyase activity.
