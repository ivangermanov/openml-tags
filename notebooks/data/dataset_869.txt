This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. This process allows for a more simplified analysis of the data.

The dataset consists of various features, including Oz One, Oz Two, Oz Three, Oz Four, Oz Five, Oz Six, Oz Seven, Oz Eight, Oz Nine, and Oz Ten, which are used to predict the binary class.
