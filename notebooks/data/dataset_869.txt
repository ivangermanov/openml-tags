Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). 

Features: oz through oz, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature across all instances. Subsequently, instances with target values below this mean were classified as positive ('P'), while those above were labeled as negative ('N'). This binary classification approach simplifies the original regression problem into a two-class prediction task.

The dataset is associated with various studies and a mythbusting theme, suggesting its potential use in challenging or verifying common assumptions in data analysis or machine learning. The features of the dataset are represented by a series of "oz" variables, followed by a binary class indicator. This structure implies a set of input variables (oz through oz) used to predict the binary outcome.

Researchers and data scientists using this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, acknowledging its derivation from an original, non-binarized version. The binarization process adds a layer of abstraction to the data, potentially making it suitable for different types of analysis or machine learning algorithms compared to the original regression problem.
