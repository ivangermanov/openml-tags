The Puma32H dataset is part of a family of datasets synthetically generated from a realistic simulation of the dynamics of a Unimation Puma 560 robot arm. There are several variations of this dataset, all based on the same model, which simulates the dynamics of a Puma 560 robot arm. The task in these datasets is to predict the angular acceleration of one of the robot arm's links.

The input features include angular positions, velocities, and torques of the robot arm. The datasets were specifically designed for the Delve environment and vary according to three factors: number of inputs, degree of non-linearity, and amount of noise in the output.

This particular dataset has a moderate number of inputs, a fairly linear relationship between inputs and outputs, and a moderate amount of noise in the output. It consists of a large number of cases, each described by a set of continuous variables. These variables include various measurements related to the robot arm's movement, such as angles, angular velocities, and torques.

The dataset was originally created as part of the Delve repository of datasets, and is now also available as part of a collection of regression datasets.
