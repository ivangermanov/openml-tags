This dataset, called "Detroit," is featured in the book "Subset selection in regression" published in the Chapman & Hall series of monographs on Statistics & Applied Probability. The data are notable for their unusual characteristic: a subset of three predictors can be identified that provides a significantly better fit to the data compared to subsets found using the Efroymson stepwise algorithm, forward selection, or backward elimination methods.

The original data were presented in an appendix of "Regression analysis and its application: A data-oriented approach," published by Marcel Dekker in their Statistics textbooks and monographs series. Some issues have arisen due to incomplete data in certain copies of the book and lack of clarity regarding which variables were used as predictors and which was the dependent variable. It has been clarified that HOM (homicide rate) was the dependent variable, with predictors ranging from FTP to WE.

The dataset contains information on the homicide rate in Detroit for the years spanning from the early to mid-sixties. Variables include full-time police per population, unemployment percentage, manufacturing workers, handgun licenses and registrations, homicides cleared by arrests, demographic information on white males, non-manufacturing workers, government workers, hourly and weekly earnings, homicide rate, death rate in accidents, and assault rate.

This dataset has been used in criminology research to examine the role of firearms in homicides in Detroit. It provides a comprehensive look at various socioeconomic and law enforcement factors that may contribute to homicide rates in an urban setting.

The data structure is such that each case spans two lines, containing multiple features related to population demographics, employment statistics, law enforcement metrics, and crime rates. This rich dataset offers opportunities for in-depth statistical analysis and modeling of urban crime patterns.
