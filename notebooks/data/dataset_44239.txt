**Meta Album Flowers Dataset (Micro)**

The Flowers dataset consists of a variety of flowers gathered from different websites and some are photographed by the original creators. These flowers are commonly found in the United Kingdom. The images generally have large-scale, pose, and light variations. Some categories of flowers in the dataset have large variations of flowers while others have similar flowers in a category.
