The original dataset for ECG Five Thousand is a twenty hour long electrocardiogram downloaded from Physionet. The name is BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database and it is record chf zero seven. The data was preprocessed in two steps: extracting each heartbeat and making each heartbeat equal length using interpolation. This dataset was originally used in a paper titled A General Framework for Never Ending Learning from Time Series Streams.

After preprocessing, five thousand heartbeats were randomly selected from the dataset. The patient has severe congestive heart failure and the class values were obtained by automated annotation.

This dataset is tagged with Language and Machine Learning.
