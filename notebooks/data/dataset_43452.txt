This dataset is based on the Student Grade Prediction dataset. It approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese Language.

Important note: the target attribute Final Grade has a strong correlation with attributes First Period Grade and Second Period Grade. This occurs because Final Grade is the final year grade, while First Period Grade and Second Period Grade correspond to the first and second period grades. It is more difficult to predict Final Grade without First Period Grade and Second Period Grade, but such prediction is much more useful.
