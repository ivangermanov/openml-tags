The Alarm Bayesian Network is a sample case study that showcases the application of probabilistic inference techniques in belief networks. This network repository reference is available online and provides detailed information about the network structure and characteristics.

The Alarm Bayesian Network consists of thirty-seven nodes and forty-six arcs, with a total of five hundred nine parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately three point five one, while the average degree is around two point four nine. The maximum in-degree of the network is four.

This network was developed as part of the Alarm Monitoring System, which aims to provide a case study for demonstrating the use of probabilistic inference techniques in artificial intelligence applications. The system focuses on monitoring patients in intensive care units and making predictions based on various medical factors.
