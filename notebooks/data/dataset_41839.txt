**Data Description**

This dataset contains the historical price data of the Foreign Exchange rate between Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen (CAD/JPY) sourced from Dukascopy's Historical Data Feed. Each instance represents a single daily candlestick, excluding weekends when the Foreign Exchange market is closed. The data ranges from January first to December thirteenth and is timestamped according to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute is defined as the direction of the mean high price of the following day relative to the mean high price of the current day. In other words, the class attribute is true if the mean high price is expected to rise in the next day and false if it is expected to fall or remain stagnant.

**Note**: This dataset is intended for scientific purposes only, and realistic trade strategies should be based on predictions made on Close attributes, which are also available.
