Social media is a vast pool of content, and among all the content available for users to access, news is an element that is accessed most frequently. These news items can be posted by politicians, news channels, newspaper websites, or even common civilians. However, these posts have to be checked for their authenticity, since spreading misinformation has been a real concern in today's times, and many firms are taking steps to make the common people aware of the consequences of spreading misinformation.

The measure of authenticity of the news posted online cannot be definitively measured, since the manual classification of news is tedious and time-consuming, and is also subject to bias. To tackle this issue, a published paper proposed a solution using a dataset called Getting Real about Fake News. This dataset was chosen because it provides comprehensive information about the sources from which the article or statement text was produced and published.

Content data preprocessing has been done on the dataset, and skew has been eliminated. The inspiration behind this work is to develop practical applications for users to gain insight from the articles they consume. This includes fact-checking websites, built-in plugins, and article parsers that can help mitigate the spread of misinformation and inform people about the type of news they consume.

The development of such tools and knowledge is crucial in an era where fake social media posts are capable of influencing naive minds. By putting technology to practical use, we can not only reduce the spread of misinformation but also create more awareness among people about the importance of verifying the authenticity of news.

Features used in this work include title, text, language, site URL, main image URL, type, and label.

Keywords: social media, news authentication, misinformation, fact-checking, fake news detection.
