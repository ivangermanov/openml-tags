The Football Matches of Spanish League dataset has been created with the goal of opening a new avenue of research in Machine Learning, specifically focused on predicting the outcomes of football matches. 

This comprehensive dataset encompasses information about football matches from the Spanish league, covering both the First and Second divisions, spanning from the 1970-71 season to the 2016-17 season.

Each entry within this dataset contains essential details regarding a particular football match, featuring attributes such as:

Season, denoting the specific year in which the match took place;
Division, specifying whether the match was part of the First or Second division;
Round, indicating the stage of the competition in which the match occurred;
Local Team, identifying the team playing at home;
Visitor Team, identifying the opposing team playing away;
Local Goals, recording the number of goals scored by the home team;
Visitor Goals, documenting the number of goals scored by the visiting team;
Date, providing the exact date on which the match was played.
