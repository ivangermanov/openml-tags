This dataset, named QSAR-TID-101276, belongs to the MetaQSAR project and was created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values of various compounds on the drug target TID: 101276. The dataset consists of twenty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Typically, generating fingerprints does not require missing value imputation since all bits are generated.

This dataset includes features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID, as well as numerous FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features.
