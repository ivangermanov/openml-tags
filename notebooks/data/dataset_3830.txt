This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Mu-Opioid Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID and numerous FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints. 

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September Two Thousand Fifteen.

The Mu-Opioid Receptor is a single protein, also known as the Mu-Type Opioid Receptor or OPRM One. It belongs to the species Guinea Pig and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and opioid receptor. 

This receptor is involved in various biological processes including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, and G protein-coupled opioid receptor signaling pathway. 

It is located in various cellular components including the endosome, plasma membrane, membrane, axon, dendrite, and perikaryon.
