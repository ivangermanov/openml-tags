QSAR-TID-101186 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101186. The dataset has twenty rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and one thousand twenty-four FCFP six features.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mu-opioid receptor, also known as Mu-type opioid receptor OPRM1. The Mu-opioid receptor is a single protein and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor. It is found in the endosome, plasma membrane, membrane, axon, dendrite, and perikaryon.

The Mu-opioid receptor has several functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, beta-endorphin receptor activity, and G protein-coupled opioid receptor activity. It is involved in several biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, neuropeptide signaling pathway, and G protein-coupled opioid receptor signaling pathway.
