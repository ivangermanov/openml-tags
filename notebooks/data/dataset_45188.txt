bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 

This Bayesian network is a comprehensive model of liver disorders, comprising seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs. The network has a total of parameters, with an average Markov blanket size of and an average degree of. The maximum in-degree of the network is.

The Hepar2 Bayesian network is a probabilistic causal model that represents the complex relationships between various symptoms, test results, and diagnoses related to liver disorders. The network incorporates a wide range of features, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint pain, platelet count, and many others.

The network is a valuable tool for medical professionals, enabling them to diagnose and treat liver disorders more effectively. It can be used to predict the probability of different diagnoses based on a patient's symptoms and test results, and to identify the most relevant factors contributing to a particular diagnosis.
