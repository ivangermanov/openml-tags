The dataset named Eye Movements has been subsampled using a seed value of three, resulting in a smaller dataset with two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes. This subsampling process was done in a stratified manner to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the dataset were identified, and if there were more than ten classes, a selection of ten classes was made using uniform sampling. The indices corresponding to these selected classes were then used to filter the data.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to select one hundred columns. Finally, if the number of rows exceeded two thousand, a stratified sampling approach was used to select a subset of two thousand rows while preserving the class distribution.

The resulting dataset contains physical sciences and transportation-related data, with features including line number, assignment number, previous fixation duration, and pupil diameter maximum, among others.
