Cover Type Seed Two Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the Cover Type dataset, generated using a specific set of parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly selecting classes and columns from the original dataset. 

The Cover Type dataset was initially reduced to a maximum of ten classes, by selecting a subset of classes based on their frequency distribution. This ensured that the resulting dataset had a balanced representation of all classes.

Next, the dataset was further reduced to a maximum of one hundred columns, by uniformly sampling the available columns. This helped to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and eliminate any redundant or correlated features.

Finally, the dataset was subsampled to a maximum of two thousand rows, while maintaining the stratification of the classes. This ensured that the resulting dataset had a representative distribution of all classes, even after reducing its size.

The resulting dataset has a total of ten classes and one hundred features. The features include various attributes related to geographical information, soil type, and wilderness areas. These features were carefully selected to ensure that they were relevant and useful for modeling purposes.
