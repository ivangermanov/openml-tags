The SMK-CAN-187 dataset is a comprehensive collection of gene expression data from airway epithelial cells. This dataset is particularly useful in the diagnostic evaluation of smokers with suspect lung cancer.

The dataset features a wide range of attributes, including gene expression levels, that can be used to identify potential biomarkers for lung cancer.
