Digital Colposcopy Schiller Test Features

The dataset was acquired and annotated by professional physicians at a hospital. The subjective judgments, originally done in an ordinal manner, were discretized into two classes. Images were randomly sampled from the original colposcopic sequences. The original images and manual segmentations are included in the images directory. The dataset has three modalities. The target variables are expert assessments and consensus.

The dataset has no missing values. It consists of sixty-two predictive attributes and seven target variables.

The features include:

* Cervix Area: the image area with cervix
* External Os Area: the image area with external os
* Vaginal Walls Area: the image area with vaginal walls
* Speculum Area: the image area with the speculum
* Artifacts Area: the image area with artifacts
* Cervix Artifacts Area: the cervix area with artifacts
* External Os Artifacts Area: the external os area with artifacts
* Vaginal Walls Artifacts Area: the vaginal walls area with artifacts
* Speculum Artifacts Area: the speculum area with artifacts
* Cervix Specularities Area: the cervix area with specular reflections
* External Os Specularities Area: the external os area with specular reflections
* Vaginal Walls Specularities Area: the vaginal walls area with specular reflections
* Speculum Specularities Area: the speculum area with specular reflections
* Total Specularities Area: the total area with specular reflections
* Maximum Area Differences: the maximum area differences between the four cervix quadrants
* Average Color Information in the Cervix: the average color information in the cervix
* Standard Deviation of Color Information in the Cervix: the standard deviation of color information in the cervix
* Average Color Information in the Image: the average color information in the image
* Standard Deviation of Color Information in the Image: the standard deviation of color information in the image
* Coverage of the Cervix Convex Hull: the coverage of the cervix convex hull by the cervix
* Image Coverage of the Cervix Convex Hull: the image coverage of the cervix convex hull
* Coverage of the Cervix Bounding Box: the coverage of the cervix bounding box by the cervix
* Image Coverage of the Cervix Bounding Box: the image coverage of the cervix bounding box
* Coverage of the Cervix Circle: the coverage of the cervix circle by the cervix
* Image Coverage of the Cervix Circle: the image coverage of the cervix circle
* Coverage of the Cervix Ellipse: the coverage of the cervix ellipse by the cervix
* Image Coverage of the Cervix Ellipse: the image coverage of the cervix ellipse
* Goodness of the Ellipse Fitting: the goodness of the ellipse fitting
* Distance between the Cervix Center and the Image Center: the distance between the cervix center and the image center
* Distance between the Cervical Os Center and the Image Center: the distance between the cervical os center and the image center
* Expert Assessments: the subjective assessments of the experts
* Consensus: the subjective assessment of the consensus
