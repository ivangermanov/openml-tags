The QSAR-TID-11785 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Tyrosine-Protein Kinase HCK, also known as Hematopoietic Cell Kinase, Hemopoietic Cell Kinase, p59Hck, or p59-HCK/p60-HCK.

This dataset has several features, including molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The features in this dataset include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, which represents the unique identifier for each compound, and MEDIAN PXc50, which represents the median activity value for each compound.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

Tyrosine-Protein Kinase HCK is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase superfamily and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including immune system function, cell differentiation, and cell survival.

The inhibition of Tyrosine-Protein Kinase HCK has been implicated in the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer and inflammation.
