Flycraft Demonstrations 

Tags: Demonstrations 

This dataset consists of demonstrations generated by the Iterative Regularized Policy Optimization with Imperfect Demonstrations algorithm for Flycraft. The demonstrations feature a range of variables, including the state of the aircraft at a given timestamp, its orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw, its velocity, and its position in three-dimensional space. Additionally, the demonstrations include the goal velocity, direction, and orientation, as well as the actions taken by the aircraft, including the power level and nose and pitch angles.
