QSAR-TID-101204 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101204. The dataset has seventy-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cartilage condensation, osteoblast differentiation, and eye development. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, protein phosphorylation, and cell differentiation.

The receptor is a transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase, which means it has the ability to phosphorylate and activate downstream signaling pathways. It is also a BMP receptor, which is a type of receptor that binds to bone morphogenetic proteins.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to study the activity of compounds on bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B and to identify potential drug candidates.
