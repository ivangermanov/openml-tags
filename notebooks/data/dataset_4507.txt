Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Dionis generated with four thousand one hundred sixty-seven samples 

This dataset has been generated through a process of subsampling, which involves selecting a smaller portion of data from the larger Dionis dataset. This subsampling process has been performed using a specific set of parameters, including a seed value of two, a maximum number of two thousand rows, a maximum number of one hundred columns, and a maximum number of ten classes. Additionally, the stratification option has been enabled, which ensures that the subsampled data maintains a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset.

The subsampling process involves several steps, including uniformly sampling classes, selecting the corresponding indices, and then uniformly sampling columns if necessary. The resulting dataset consists of two thousand samples, each with one hundred features, and belongs to one of ten classes.
