QSAR-TID-10549 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10549. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings, which are a notation for describing molecular structures. The fingerprints are used to capture the structural properties of molecules, which can be used to predict their activity on a particular drug target.

The dataset is useful for researchers who want to develop predictive models for the oxytocin receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including social behavior, memory, and heart development.
