Name: Sylvine Seed One N Rows Two Thousand N Classes Ten N Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Sylvine with seed equals one, arguments n rows equals two thousand, arguments n columns equals one hundred, arguments n classes equals ten, and arguments no stratify equals false.

Generated with the following source code:

The subsample function takes in a seed, the maximum number of rows, the maximum number of columns, the maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify or not. It returns a dataset.

The function first gets the unique classes from the target variable. If there are more classes than the maximum allowed, it selects a subset of classes using a weighted random choice, where the weights are the value counts of each class. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly.

Next, if the number of columns is greater than the maximum allowed, it uniformly samples the columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum allowed, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data.

Finally, it converts categorical columns to string and returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
