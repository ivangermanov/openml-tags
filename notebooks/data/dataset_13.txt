Breast Cancer Dataset

Tags: mythbusting, study, uci

This breast cancer domain was obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. Please include a citation if you plan to use this database.

The dataset contains information on breast cancer cases, including 201 instances of one class and 85 instances of another class. The instances are described by 9 attributes, some of which are linear and some are nominal. This is one of three domains provided by the Oncology Institute that has repeatedly appeared in the machine learning literature.

The dataset includes 286 instances and 10 attributes (including the class attribute). Some attributes have missing values, denoted by "?". The class distribution is as follows: 201 instances of no recurrence events and 85 instances of recurrence events.

Attribute Information:
Class: no recurrence events, recurrence events
Age: ranges from 10 to 99 in 10 year increments
Menopause: less than 40, greater than or equal to 40, premenopausal
Tumor size: ranges from 0 to 59 in 5 unit increments
Involved nodes: ranges from 0 to 39 in various increments
Node caps: yes, no
Degree of malignancy: 1, 2, 3
Breast: left, right
Breast quadrant: left up, left low, right up, right low, central
Irradiation: yes, no

The dataset has been used in various machine learning studies, with accuracy ranges typically between 65% and 78%. It has been applied in incremental learning systems, induction in noisy domains, and knowledge elicitation tools.

This dataset is valuable for researchers studying breast cancer prognosis and developing machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis and prediction.
