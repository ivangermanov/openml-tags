Breast Cancer Wisconsin Original Data Set 

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Original Data Set consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis, which can be either malignant or benign.

The data set was adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version, and sample code IDs were removed. Note that there is also a related Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnosis Data Set with a different set of features, better known as wdbc.

If you publish results using this database, please include an acknowledgment citing the source of the data set.

This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. 

Features include clump thickness, cell size uniformity, cell shape uniformity, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitoses.

Scraped data includes additional information about the samples, which arrived periodically as clinical cases were reported. The database reflects this chronological grouping of the data. 

Group information has been removed from the data itself, but it is available separately. The total number of instances in the data set is six hundred ninety-nine points.

Note that some instances were removed or revised due to missing or incorrect values.

Has missing values? Yes.

Additional variable information is available for each feature.

Class labels are two for benign and four for malignant.
