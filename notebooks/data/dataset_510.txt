**Sleep**

This dataset contains three more features compared to the previous version of the same dataset. It includes data from which conclusions were drawn in the article "Sleep in Mammals: Ecological and Constitutional Correlates". The dataset provides information on sixty-two mammals, including their brain and body weights, lifespan, gestation time, time spent sleeping, and predation and danger indices.

The variables included in this dataset are:

* Species of animal
* Body weight in kilograms
* Brain weight in grams
* Slow-wave (non-dreaming) sleep in hours per day
* Paradoxical (dreaming) sleep in hours per day
* Total sleep in hours per day (the sum of slow-wave and paradoxical sleep)
* Maximum lifespan in years
* Gestation time in days
* Predation index (a rating from one to five indicating how likely an animal is to be preyed upon)
* Sleep exposure index (a rating from one to five indicating how exposed an animal is while sleeping)
* Overall danger index (a rating from one to five based on the predation index, sleep exposure index, and other factors)
