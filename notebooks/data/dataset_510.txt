Please cite: This dataset contains additional features compared to version of the same dataset. Data from which conclusions were drawn in the article "Sleep in Mammals: Ecological and Constitutional Correlates" published in Science.

This dataset includes information on brain and body weight, life span, gestation time, time sleeping, and predation and danger indices for mammals. Variables for the Mammals Data Set include species of animal, body weight in kilograms, brain weight in grams, slow wave ("nondreaming") sleep in hours per day, paradoxical ("dreaming") sleep in hours per day, total sleep in hours per day (sum of slow wave and paradoxical sleep), maximum life span in years, gestation time in days, predation index, sleep exposure index, and overall danger index.

The predation index ranges from minimum (least likely to be preyed upon) to maximum (most likely to be preyed upon). The sleep exposure index ranges from least exposed (e.g., animal sleeps in a well-protected den) to most exposed. The overall danger index is based on the above two indices and other information, ranging from least danger (from other animals) to most danger (from other animals).

The dataset is of numeric class type with no specific class index. It contains features related to various aspects of mammalian sleep patterns, physical characteristics, and environmental factors.
