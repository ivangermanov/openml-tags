QSAR-TID-10702 Dataset: MetaQSAR Project - September 2015

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10702. It consists of 455 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and various FCFP6 1024-bit molecular fingerprint features.
