QSAR-TID-10702 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10702. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset contains a total of one thousand and twenty-six features, including the molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50.

The target of this dataset is Methionine Aminopeptidase Two, a single protein that is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and protein processing. It is a metalloprotease that cleaves the initiator methionine from nascent protein sequences.

Methionine Aminopeptidase Two is a potential drug target, and inhibitors of this enzyme have been developed as potential therapeutic agents. The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of new drugs targeting this enzyme.
