This dataset contains Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including identifiers and a class feature. 

The features represent extended connectivity fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
