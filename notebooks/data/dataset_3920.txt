QSAR-TID-11279 Tags: Machine Learning QSAR, study three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand one hundred seventy-nine, and it has a large number of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. This particular dataset is focused on the drug target TID: one thousand one hundred seventy-nine, and it contains a large number of compounds with their corresponding activity values.

The features in this dataset are represented as FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is suitable for machine learning and QSAR modeling, and it can be used to develop predictive models for the drug target TID: one thousand one hundred seventy-nine.
