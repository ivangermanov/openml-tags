This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Proteinase Activated Receptor One, also known as Coagulation Factor Two Receptor, F Two R, PAR One, and PAR-One. It has six hundred forty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen.

The target is a single protein preferred name, proteinase activated receptor one, synonyms include coagulation factor two receptor, F Two R, PAR One, and PAR-One. It belongs to the species group, Homo sapiens, and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein coupled receptor, peptide receptor, protease activated receptor, and protease activated receptor.
