QSAR-TID-10653 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10653. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 645 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

Proteinase-activated receptor 1 is a single protein preferred name, also known as Coagulation Factor II Receptor, F2R, PAR1, and PAR-1. It is a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and protease-activated receptor.

The protein target classification is 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Protease-activated receptor/Protease-activated receptor.

The description of the protein is a proteinase-activated receptor 1, which is a single protein.

The organism is Homo sapiens, and the species group is no protein target classification.

The protein target classification is 1. Membrane receptor/Family A G protein-coupled receptor/Peptide receptor (family A GPCR)/Protease-activated receptor/Protease-activated receptor.

The dataset contains information about the proteinase-activated receptor 1, including its synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description.
