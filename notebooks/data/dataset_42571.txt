When you've been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter the most: family, friends, and other loved ones. Pushing paper with your insurance agent is the last place you want your time or mental energy spent. This is why Allstate, a personal insurer in the United States, is continually seeking fresh ideas to improve their claims service for their customers. Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this recruitment challenge, competitors are invited to show off their creativity and flex their technical skills by creating an algorithm that accurately predicts claims severity. Aspiring competitors will demonstrate insight into better ways to predict claims severity for the chance to be part of Allstate's efforts to ensure a worry-free customer experience.

Each row in this dataset represents an insurance claim. You must predict the value for the loss column. The dataset includes various features, including categorical and continuous variables.
