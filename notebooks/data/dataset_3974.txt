QSAR-TID-100129 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100129. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 513 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The target is Ephrin type-B receptor 4, a single protein, also known as Hepatoma transmembrane kinase, HTK, MYK1. It is a protein kinase belonging to the tyrosine protein kinase family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, cell migration, heart morphogenesis, protein phosphorylation, cell adhesion, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

The dataset is related to other targets, including Ephrin receptor, VHL/Ephrin type-B receptor 4, and EphB4.

Some compounds that inhibit Ephrin type-B receptor 4 are TG100-801, TESEVATINIB, and JI-101.

The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, and is involved in various diseases, including cancer.
