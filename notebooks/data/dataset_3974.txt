This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred twenty-nine, and it has five hundred thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault systemes biobia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fcfp six one thousand twenty-four zero, fcfp six one thousand twenty-four one, fcfp six one thousand twenty-four two, fcfp six one thousand twenty-four three, fcfp six one thousand twenty-four four, fcfp six one thousand twenty-four five, and so on up to nine hundred twenty-six more.

Scraped data includes id chembl five one four seven, type single protein, preferred name ephrin type b receptor four, synonyms ephb four ephrin type b receptor four hepatoma transmembrane kinase ht k myk one, and so on.

Organism is homo sapiens, species group is no, protein target classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase tk protein kinase group tyrosine protein kinase eph family.
