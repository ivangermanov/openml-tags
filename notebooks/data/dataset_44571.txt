Name: Ada Seed Three Rows Two Thousand Classes Ten Columns One Hundred Stratify True

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Ada with seed three, generated with the following source code:

This function subsamples a dataset to reduce its size while maintaining its characteristics. It takes in several parameters, including a seed for reproducibility, the maximum number of rows, columns, and classes, and a boolean indicating whether to stratify the sampling.

The function first uniformly samples classes from the dataset, selecting a specified number of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and reduces the dataset to these indices.

Next, the function uniformly samples columns from the dataset, selecting a specified number of columns. If the dataset has more rows than the specified maximum, it stratifies the sampling according to the target variable, ensuring that the sampled dataset maintains the same class distribution as the original.

Finally, the function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
