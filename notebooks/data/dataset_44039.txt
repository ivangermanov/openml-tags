This dataset belongs to the "regression on categorical and numerical features" benchmark. It is one of forty-one drug design datasets formed using Adriana Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from the original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The original studies include Carbolenes, MTP Two, Chang, Cristalli, Depreux, Doherty, Garrat Two, Garrat, Heyl, Krystek, Lewis, Penning, Rosowsky, Siddiqi, Stevenson, Strupcz, Svensson, Thompson, Tsutumi, Uejling, Yokoyama One, and Yokoyama Two. These studies were published in various journals, including the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry and the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences.

The dataset also includes studies on melting point prediction, molecular descriptors, and quantitative structure-activity relationships. These studies were published in journals such as the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling and the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.

The dataset features are primarily molecular descriptors, including topological and physicochemical properties.

Keywords: drug design, molecular descriptors, quantitative structure-activity relationships, regression, categorical and numerical features.
