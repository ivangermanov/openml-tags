**Meta Album Birds Dataset (Extended)**

When the Meta Album was created, the Birds dataset contained images of three hundred fifteen bird species, but now it has increased the number of species to four hundred fifty. It has more than forty-nine thousand images, each with a resolution of two hundred twenty-four pixels by two hundred twenty-four pixels. All the images have their natural background, which can lead to bias since, for example, some birds are frequently found in water backgrounds. Additionally, the dataset is imbalanced regarding the ratio of male species images to female species images.

The preprocessed version distributed in Meta Album is made from the original dataset by resizing all the images to a resolution of one hundred twenty-eight pixels by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
