QSAR-TID-30013 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30013. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The project is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the Dual Specificity Protein Kinase CLK1, which is a protein target that belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/CMGC protein kinase group/CMGC protein kinase CLK family. The protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation, and peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation.

The dataset also provides information about the expression of the protein in different tissues and its role in various diseases. The protein is expressed in the nucleus and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer.
