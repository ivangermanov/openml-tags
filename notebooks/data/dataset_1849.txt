QSAR-TID-10586 Dataset

Tags: Machine Learning, Meteorology, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10586. It has thirteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Platelet Activating Factor Receptor, which is a single protein preferred name. It is also known as PAFr, PAF-R, Platelet-Activating Factor Receptor, and Ptafr. This receptor is found in the species Mus musculus, and it belongs to the group of membrane receptors, family A G protein-coupled receptors, small molecule receptors, and lipid-like ligand receptors.

The platelet-activating factor receptor is involved in various biological processes, including positive regulation of cellular extravasation, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, chemotaxis, inflammatory response, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It also plays a role in response to symbiotic bacterium, positive regulation of phospholipase C activity, lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, and response to lipopolysaccharide.
