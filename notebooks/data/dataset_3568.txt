The QSAR-TID-30018 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, containing QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 30018. This dataset has multiple features representing FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains nine hundred three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features such as MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is related to the LIM domain kinase one, also known as LIMK one, a single protein target classified under the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TKL protein kinase group/TKL protein kinase LISK family/TKL protein kinase LIMK subfamily.

The LIM domain kinase one is expressed in various cellular components, including the male germ cell nucleus, nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, membrane, nuclear speck, lamellipodium, neuron projection, and intracellular organelle.

This protein is involved in multiple biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, Rho protein signal transduction, nervous system development, phosphorylation, actin cytoskeleton organization, positive regulation of actin filament bundle assembly, Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis, stress fiber assembly, positive regulation of axon extension, and axon extension.

It is also associated with various molecular functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, heat shock protein binding, and metal ion binding.
