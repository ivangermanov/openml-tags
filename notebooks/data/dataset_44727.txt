Name: Adult Dataset Subsample with Four Rows, Two Thousand Maximum Rows, One Hundred Maximum Columns, Ten Maximum Classes, and Stratification Enabled

Tags: Subsampling of the Adult Dataset with Seed Four

This dataset is a subsample of the Adult dataset, generated using a specific source code. The subsampling process involves uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The Adult dataset is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks. This subsample was generated with a seed of four, which ensures reproducibility of the results. The maximum number of rows in this subsample is two thousand, and the maximum number of columns is one hundred. Additionally, the maximum number of classes is ten.

The subsampling process first involves selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum number of classes, a random sample of classes is selected based on their frequency in the dataset. The indices of the samples belonging to these selected classes are then used to subset the dataset.

Next, the columns of the dataset are uniformly sampled if the number of columns exceeds the maximum number of columns. The selected columns are then used to subset the dataset.

Finally, the rows of the dataset are stratified sampled if the number of rows exceeds the maximum number of rows. This ensures that the class distribution is preserved in the subsample.

The resulting dataset contains the following features: age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country. The class feature is the target variable.
