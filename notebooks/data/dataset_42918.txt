The Skillcraft1 master table dataset is a collection of data aggregated from screen movements into screen fixations using the Salvucci and Goldberg dispersion threshold algorithm, and defined Perception Action Cycles as fixations with at least one action. Time is recorded in terms of timestamps in the StarCraft 2 replay file, where one real-time second is equivalent to roughly eighty-eight point five timestamps when the game is played on faster.
