Tags: This dataset consists of predicting the cellular localization sites of proteins.

The dataset contains features that are essential for identifying the localization site of a protein. These features include various characteristics that are crucial in determining where a protein will be located within a cell.

The predicted attribute of this dataset is the localization site of a protein, which is a non-numeric value.

This dataset has been developed based on previous research that focused on creating an expert system for predicting protein localization sites in gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotic cells. The results of this research were published in two papers, one in Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics and another in Genomics.

Fortunately, this dataset does not have any missing values, making it a reliable source of information for researchers.

Keywords: protein localization, cellular localization, expert system, gram-negative bacteria, eukaryotic cells, protein attributes.
