Tags: This dataset consists of predicting the cellular localization sites of proteins.

The dataset features a range of attributes, including several that are not easily readable by humans.

Scraped Data: Dataset Information Additional Information

The predicted attribute of this dataset is the localization site of a protein, which is a non-numeric value.

The development of this dataset is described in several references, which also provide results for classification by a rule-based expert system with an earlier version of the dataset. These references describe a predecessor to this dataset and its development, and they also give results for classification by a rule-based expert system with that version of the dataset.

The dataset does not have any missing values.

Keywords: protein localization, cellular localization, expert system, protein attributes, dataset development.
