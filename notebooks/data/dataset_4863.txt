Eye Movements Dataset 

Tags: Life Science, Machine Learning 

Inferring Relevance from Eye Movements involves feature extraction to classify relevance based on eye movements. The dataset, available online, provides pre-computed feature vectors for each word in an eye movement trajectory, along with class labels. 

This dataset consists of multiple assignments, each comprising a question followed by ten sentences that serve as titles of news articles. Among these sentences, one is the correct answer to the question, five are irrelevant, and four are relevant but do not directly answer the question.

The dataset features include various aspects related to eye movements, such as fixation duration, saccade length, pupil diameter, and regression duration, among others.
