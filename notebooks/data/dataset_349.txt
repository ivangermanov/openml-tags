Data on Fluctuating Proportions of Marked Cells in Marrow from Heterozygous Safari Cats from a Study of Early Hematopoiesis.

The data included below are eleven time series of proportions of marked progenitor cells from the bone marrow of the hybrid Safari cat. These data come from experiments done at the University of Washington, Seattle.

There are four columns and a total of records. The first column is an identification for the cat in the study. The second column records the time, in weeks from the start of monitoring, that the measurement from marrow is recorded. The third column gives the percentage of domestic type progenitor cells observed in a sample of cells at that time. The fourth column gives the sample size at that time, that is, the number of progenitor cells analyzed.

For background on the data, see publications related to early hematopoiesis. These particular data are used in an analysis of stochastic modeling of early hematopoiesis.
