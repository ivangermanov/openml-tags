The Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to computer systems and machine learning, specifically focused on microarray analysis.

This dataset, also known as Lymphoma Eleven Classes, DLBCL, provides a wealth of information for researchers and scientists working in the field of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

The dataset features a vast array of genes, including those involved in various biological processes and pathways. While some of these genes have human-readable names, others are denoted by complex identifiers such as GENE.

The dataset has been widely cited in scientific literature, with one notable publication being "Distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling" in the journal Nature.

The dataset has numerous applications in computer systems and machine learning, particularly in the development of predictive models for diagnosing and treating diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
