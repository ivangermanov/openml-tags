Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma dataset, also known as Lymphoma 11 classes, is a microarray dataset that identifies distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through gene expression profiling. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of gene expression data that provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this type of cancer.

The dataset features a wide range of genes, including those involved in cell signaling, metabolism, and gene regulation. These genes are crucial for understanding the biological processes that drive the development and progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of different samples, researchers can identify specific patterns and biomarkers that are associated with distinct subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

This dataset has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and improve patient outcomes by enabling the development of more targeted and personalized treatments.
