QSAR-TID-76 Dataset Information

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID seventy-six. It has four hundred fifty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fcfp six one hundred twenty-four zero, fcfp six one hundred twenty-four one, fcfp six one hundred twenty-four two, and many others.

Data Source

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September two thousand fifteen.
