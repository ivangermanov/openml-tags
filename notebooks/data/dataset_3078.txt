QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Proteasome Macropain subunit PRE, also known as DOA, Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex subunit PRE, PRE, and PRG. This protein is found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sc and is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Threonine protease/Threonine protease PBT clan/Threonine protease TA subfamily.

The protein is associated with several cellular components, including the proteasome complex, nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, and proteasome core complex. Its functions include endopeptidase activity, threonine type endopeptidase activity, protein binding, peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. The protein is involved in various biological processes such as proteolysis, proteasomal protein catabolic processes, and proteasome core complex assembly.

This target is linked to multiple databases and resources, including canSAR Target, IntAct, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It is associated with numerous protein structures and is involved in pathways such as cross presentation of soluble exogenous antigens, TNFR non canonical NF kB pathway, and Ub specific processing proteases.
