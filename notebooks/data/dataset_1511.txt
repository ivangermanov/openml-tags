QSAR-TID-20122 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: two thousand one hundred twenty-two, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including identifiers and a class feature: Molecule ChEMBL Identifier and Median pXC50. 

The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL Identifier, and many others.
