**QSAR-TID-11000**
Tags: Health, Medicine, MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11000. It has twelve rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

MOLECULE ChEMBL ID is a unique identifier for each molecule. The FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the structure of molecules.

This dataset was created as part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.
