Churn happens when customers are leaving their current service provider and moving to another one. This is a big business problem because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one from leaving. This explains the challenge, which is one of the pre-qualifications to the Data Science Nigeria all-expense paid boot camp and hackathon. Read up, fine-tune your model, build incremental statistical thinking, and reinforce your Data Science career growth.

An academic dataset has been used here to help participants classify potential customers who might churn. Please note that a balanced dataset has been used. The features include customer identification, network age, customer tenure in months, total spend in the first and second months of the year, total SMS spend, total data spend, total data consumption, total unique calls, total on-net spend, total off-net spend, total call center complaint calls, network type subscription in the first month, network type subscription in the second month, most loved competitor network in the first month, and most loved competitor network in the second month, and churn status.
