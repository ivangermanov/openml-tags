The QSAR-TID-193 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 193. This dataset has 199 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

The MetaQSAR project was used to generate this dataset in September 2015. It is recommended to cite this dataset when using it for research purposes.

The molecules in this dataset have been tested for their activity on the Coagulation Factor IX protein target. Coagulation Factor IX is a single protein that plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process. It is also known as Christmas disease protein or plasma thromboplastin component.

The dataset includes information about the molecules, such as their chemical structure and activity values. The activity values are represented as pseudo-pCI50 units. The molecules have been fingerprinted using the FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprinting method, which generates a binary vector representing the presence or absence of specific substructures in the molecule.

The dataset also includes information about the protein target, including its classification, synonyms, and accession number. The protein target is classified as a serine-type endopeptidase, which means it cleaves peptide bonds in proteins.
