QSAR-TID-193 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 193. The dataset has 199 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and includes activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to Coagulation Factor IX, a protein that plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process. The protein is involved in the intrinsic pathway of fibrin clot formation and is also known as Christmas Factor.

Coagulation Factor IX is a single protein target that is classified as a serine-type endopeptidase. It is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, blood coagulation, and hemostasis.

The dataset includes information on various compounds that interact with Coagulation Factor IX, including their activity values and molecular fingerprints. The data can be used to develop predictive models of Coagulation Factor IX activity and to identify potential drug candidates.
