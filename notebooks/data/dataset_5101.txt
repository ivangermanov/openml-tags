Timing Attack Dataset Fifteen Micro Seconds Delay 

Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics, Bleichenbacher 

This dataset contains attributes related to the Bleichenbacher Timing Attack, which is a type of attack used to compromise the security of encrypted data. The attack takes advantage of the time difference between different types of cryptographic operations to deduce the contents of encrypted data.

The attributes in this dataset describe various aspects of the communication protocol used during the attack, including the source and destination ports, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, and flags used in the transmission control protocol (TCP).

Attribute Descriptions:

CCS Zero Attributes:
These attributes describe the first change cipher spec TCP acknowledgement message. They include the source port, destination port, port number, stream index, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flag, nonce flag, congestion window reduced flag, ECN echo flag, urgent flag, acknowledgment flag, push flag, reset flag, syn flag, fin flag, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, NOP option, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.

TLS Zero Attributes:
These attributes describe the first TLS alert message. They include the source port, destination port, port number, stream index, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flag, nonce flag, congestion window reduced flag, ECN echo flag, urgent flag, acknowledgment flag, push flag, reset flag, syn flag, fin flag, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, NOP option, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, record content type, record length, alert message level, alert message description, and message order.

DISC Zero Attributes:
These attributes describe the first TCP disconnect message. They include the source port, destination port, port number, stream index, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flag, nonce flag, congestion window reduced flag, ECN echo flag, urgent flag, acknowledgment flag, push flag, reset flag, syn flag, fin flag, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, NOP option, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.

DISC One Attributes:
These attributes describe the second TCP disconnect message. They include the source port, destination port, port number, stream index, segment length, sequence number, next sequence number, acknowledgment number, header length, reserved flag, nonce flag, congestion window reduced flag, ECN echo flag, urgent flag, acknowledgment flag, push flag, reset flag, syn flag, fin flag, window size value, calculated window size, window size scale factor, checksum status, urgent pointer, NOP option, option kind, option length, timestamp value, time delta, and message order.
