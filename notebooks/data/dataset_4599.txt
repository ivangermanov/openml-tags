Subsampling of the dataset MFeat Factors with seed equal to four arguments number rows maximum equal to two thousand arguments number columns maximum equal to one hundred arguments number classes maximum equal to ten arguments no stratify equal to true generated with the following source code.

The function subsample takes in several parameters including seed, number rows maximum, number columns maximum, number classes maximum, and stratified. It uses the numpy random default random generator to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset.

The function first selects a subset of classes based on their frequency in the dataset. It then selects the corresponding indices where these classes are present and subsets the data accordingly. Next, it uniformly samples columns if the total number of columns exceeds the specified maximum.

If the total number of rows exceeds the specified maximum, the function uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows. This ensures that the class distribution in the sampled data is similar to the original data. Finally, the function converts categorical columns to strings and returns a new dataset with the sampled data.
