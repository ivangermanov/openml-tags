Pharynx Dataset 

This dataset consists of one hundred ninety-five observations, thirteen variables, and is a part of a large clinical trial conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group in the United States. The full study involved patients with squamous carcinoma of fifteen sites in the mouth and throat, with sixteen participating institutions, although only data on three sites in the oropharynx reported by the six largest institutions are considered here.

Patients who entered the study were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, either radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy combined with a chemotherapeutic agent. A primary objective of the study was to compare the two treatment policies regarding patient survival.

The dataset is in free format, where at least one blank space separates each variable. The variables include case number, participating institution, sex, treatment, grade, age at the time of diagnosis, condition, site of the primary tumor, T staging, N staging, date of study entry, status, and time.

Approximately thirty percent of the survival times are censored, primarily due to patients surviving until the time of analysis. Some patients were lost to follow-up because they moved or transferred to an institution not participating in the study, although these cases were relatively rare. 

From a statistical perspective, an essential feature of these data is the significant lack of homogeneity between individuals being studied. While certain criteria for patient eligibility had to be met, eliminating extremes in the extent of disease, many factors remain uncontrolled. This study included measurements of numerous covariates expected to relate to survival experience, including sex, T staging, N staging, age, general condition, and grade.

The site of the primary tumor and possible differences between participating institutions require consideration as well. The T and N staging classification provides a measure of the extent of the tumor at the primary site and at regional lymph nodes. The variable general condition measures the functional capacity of the patient at the time of diagnosis, while the variable grade measures the degree of differentiation of the tumor.

In addition to determining whether the combined treatment mode is preferable to conventional radiation therapy, it is crucial to identify the extent to which the various covariates relate to subsequent survival. It is also vital to adjust the survivals for possible imbalances present in the study regarding other covariates.
