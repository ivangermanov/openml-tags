The BNG (ionosphere) dataset is an artificial dataset used for studying ionospheric phenomena. It contains multiple features labeled with the letter "a" followed by a class designation. This dataset is part of a broader study on ionospheric characteristics and their implications for radio signal propagation. The artificial nature of the data allows for controlled analysis of various ionospheric parameters and their interactions. Researchers utilize this dataset to develop and test algorithms for ionospheric modeling and prediction.
