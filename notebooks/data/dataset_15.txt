Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set

Tags: cancer, medical, mythbusting, OpenML-CC, OpenML, study

This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses. The features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. The target feature records the prognosis as either malignant or benign.

The original data is available from the University of Wisconsin. The current dataset was adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version, with sample code identifiers removed. It's important to note that there is a related Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis) Data Set with a different set of features, better known as wdbc.

The database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. If you publish results using this database, please include this information in your acknowledgments and cite the relevant papers listed in the original source.

The dataset reflects a chronological grouping of data as samples arrived periodically from clinical cases. The data was collected over several years, with multiple groups of instances added at different time points. Some revisions were made to the original data, including replacing zero values, removing certain records, and changing specific field values.

Features in the dataset include Clump Thickness, Cell Size Uniformity, Cell Shape Uniformity, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei, Bland Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli, and Mitoses. The class variable indicates whether the sample is benign or malignant.

The dataset contains missing values. Each feature is rated on a scale of one to ten. The class labels are represented as two for benign and four for malignant.

This breast cancer database has been widely used in research and has been cited in numerous academic papers focusing on pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, and machine learning applications in healthcare.
