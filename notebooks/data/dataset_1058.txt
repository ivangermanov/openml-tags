This dataset focuses on assessing the reliability of human estimators in project management contexts. It contains information on estimators' educational background, technical and management coursework, professional development activities, language experience, project management experience in hardware and software domains, and industry-specific experience.

The data was originally used in a study presented at the Second International Predictive Models in Software Engineering Workshop. Since then, the dataset has expanded by approximately fifty percent, allowing for division into three major categories: severe underestimators, accurate estimators, and severe overestimators.

The dataset comprises instances with independent variables covering various aspects of an estimator's background and experience. These include educational degree, number of technical and management courses at undergraduate and graduate levels, attendance at workshops and conferences, language experience, project management experience in hardware and software domains, number of projects estimated, and industry-specific experience.

The dependent variable represents the overall relative error for the participant's estimates, calculated as the absolute value of the difference between total estimates and total actual values, divided by the total actual value.

This expanded dataset enables comparative analysis between underestimators and accurate estimators, as well as between overestimators and accurate estimators, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing human estimation accuracy in project management contexts.
