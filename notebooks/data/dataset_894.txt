Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a binarized adaptation of an original dataset from an unknown source. The primary modification involves the conversion of a numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This transformation results in a two-class nominal target feature, simplifying the classification task.

The dataset comprises several columns of data, with the final column representing the binary classification outcome. Researchers and data scientists may find this binarized version particularly useful for binary classification tasks, hypothesis testing, or comparative studies between numeric and categorical target variables.

As the original source and date of creation are unknown, users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it as a binarized version of the primary dataset, referencing version one where applicable. This acknowledgment ensures proper attribution and allows for traceability in research and analysis workflows.
