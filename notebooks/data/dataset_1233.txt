This dataset contains extensive acoustic features extracted from eating sounds. The features encompass a wide range of auditory and signal processing measurements, including spectral characteristics, energy levels, and temporal properties of the audio. These detailed acoustic parameters can potentially be used to analyze and classify different aspects of eating behaviors or food textures based on the sounds produced during consumption.
