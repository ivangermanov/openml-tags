Sub-sampling of the dataset Bank-Marketing with a specified seed value, generated to accommodate specific parameters. 

The sub-sampling function is designed to reduce the dataset while maintaining its overall characteristics. It achieves this by uniformly selecting classes, columns, and rows. 

First, it identifies unique classes within the dataset and selects a specified number of them based on their frequency distribution. This ensures that the resulting sub-dataset retains a representative distribution of classes.

Next, it uniformly samples columns from the original dataset, ensuring that the sub-dataset has a specified maximum number of columns.

Finally, it applies stratified sampling to select a specified number of rows, taking into account the class distribution to maintain the dataset's overall structure.

The resulting sub-dataset consists of a specified number of rows, columns, and classes, while preserving the essence of the original dataset.
