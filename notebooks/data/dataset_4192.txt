Data Shows the Downlink Goodput for Unicast and Multicast Transmissions with Different Group Sizes and Network Loads on an IEEE 802.11ac Network Simulated on NS-3. 

This dataset focuses on the performance of various IEEE 802.11aa Group Address Translation Services (GATS) on a wireless local area network (WLAN) based on the IEEE 802.11ac standard. The data was generated through simulations conducted using NS-3.

The dataset includes information about the mode of multicast transmission, the number of stations involved in multicast and unicast transmissions, the amount of data injected into the network for both multicast and unicast transmissions, and the resulting occupancy of the network. 

Additionally, the dataset provides insights into the average data rate for both downlink and uplink transmissions, delays experienced during these transmissions, and the number of retransmissions required. 

The goodput, which represents the amount of useful data transferred per unit time, is also reported for both unicast and multicast transmissions.
