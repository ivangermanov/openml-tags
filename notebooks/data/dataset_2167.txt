This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 243. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features, such as molecule chembl id and median pxc50. The features represent fingerprints, which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biobia.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset is part of the metaqsar project and was created in september. It contains qsar data from chembl version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target tid two four three.

The dataset has multiple features, including molecule chembl id, fingerprint six one zero two four zero, fingerprint six one zero two four one, fingerprint six one zero two four two, and many others. 

The data is related to aminopeptidase n, also known as alanyl aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase m, anpep, ap-m, and other synonyms. It is an enzyme/protease/metallo protease/metallo protease mae clan/metallo protease m one family. 

It is associated with homo sapiens species group, and its protein target classification is one point enzyme/protease/metallo protease/metallo protease mae clan/metallo protease m one family. 

The expression atlas includes multiple go components, such as extracellular space, cytoplasm, lysosomal membrane, endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment, plasma membrane, external side of plasma membrane, membrane, secretory granule membrane, and extracellular exosome. 

It also includes multiple go functions, such as virus receptor activity, aminopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, signaling receptor activity, peptide binding, metal ion binding, and metalloaminopeptidase activity. 

Additionally, it is associated with multiple go processes, such as angiogenesis, proteolysis, cell differentiation, peptide catabolic process, and viral entry into host cell.
