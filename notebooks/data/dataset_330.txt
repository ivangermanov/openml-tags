PROF FOOTBALL SCORES

How well do the oddsmakers of Las Vegas predict the outcome of professional football games? Is there really a home field advantage - if so, how large is it? Are teams that play the Monday Night game at a disadvantage when they play again the following Sunday? Do teams benefit from having a bye week off in the current schedule? These questions and a host of others can be investigated using this data set.

This data set was compiled to investigate various aspects of professional football games. It includes scores for all National Football League games from several seasons. The data was used as part of a presentation titled "Who's Number One?" in a special session at the Joint Statistics Meetings.

Several variables in the data are related to the oddsmakers' point spread for each game. The point spread is a value assigned before each game to serve as a handicap for whichever team is perceived to be the better team. Thus, to win against the point spread, the favorite team must beat the underdog team by more points than the spread. The underdog wins against the spread if it wins the game outright or manages to lose by fewer points than the spread. In theory, the point spread should represent the expert prediction as to the game's outcome. In practice, it more usually denotes a point at which an equal amount of money will be wagered both for and against the favored team.

The raw data contains information on nine variables: whether the favored team is playing at home or away, points scored by the favored and underdog teams, the point spread, codes for the favored and underdog teams' names, year, week, weekday, and whether the game went into overtime.
