Harry Potter Fan Fiction Data

As a huge Harry Potter fan, I wanted to collect fan fiction data to create a dashboard and visualize it. This project is currently in the works. 

I scraped this data from the website https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/ using the requests and beautiful soup libraries. The data is completely structured. The scraping code can be found on GitHub. 

This dataset contains all Harry Potter fan fiction entries written between two thousand and one and two thousand and nineteen in all available languages. The data does not contain the story itself but rather the story blurb. 

I would like to acknowledge that the code is entirely my own work. The thumbnail and banner are attributed to Christian Wagner on Unsplash. 

This dataset can be used to answer questions such as which is the most popular pairing, which language has the most fan fictions written in it, and what has been the general trend like since the last movie or book came out. 

The dataset features include chapters, favorites, follows, publication date, reviews, update date, words, characters, genre, language, rating, story link, synopsis, title, and published month and year. 

Keywords: Harry Potter, fan fiction, data visualization, dashboard, pairing, language, trend analysis.
