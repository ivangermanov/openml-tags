I am a huge Harry Potter fan who wanted to collect fan fiction data to create a dashboard and visualize it. This project is currently in the works.

I scraped this data from the website www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/ using the Python libraries Requests and Beautiful Soup. The data is completely structured. The scraping code can be found on GitHub.

The dataset contains all Harry Potter fan fiction entries written between two thousand and one and two thousand nineteen in all available languages. However, the data does not contain the story itself, only the story blurb.

Acknowledgments for this project go solely to myself for creating the code. The thumbnail and banner used were taken from Unsplash, courtesy of Christian Wagner.

This dataset allows users to answer various questions, such as which is the most popular character pairing, which language has the most fan fictions written in it, and what has been the general trend like since the last movie or book was released.

Features of the dataset include chapters, favorites, follows, publication date, reviews, update date, word count, character list, genre, language, rating, story link, synopsis, title, and character pairings.

Keywords: Harry Potter, fan fiction, data visualization, machine learning, mathematics.
