The Electrical Discharge Machining dataset represents a multi-target regression problem where the goal is to minimize machining time by replicating the behavior of a human operator who controls the values of two variables. This complex process involves finding the optimal combination of settings to achieve efficient results.

Each of the target variables has three distinct numeric values, and there are sixteen continuous input variables that influence the outcome. These inputs encompass various aspects of the electrical discharge machining process, including mean and standard deviation measurements for different components.

This dataset presents a challenging machine learning problem due to its multi-target nature and the need to balance competing factors to optimize performance.
