The Airlines Dataset is a life science and machine learning inspired dataset that aims to predict whether a given flight will be delayed based on its scheduled departure information.

The task involves analyzing various factors that contribute to flight delays, including the specific flight details, time of departure, length of the journey, airline operating the flight, airport of origin, destination airport, day of the week, and class of service.

By examining these key factors, the goal is to develop an accurate prediction model that can identify flights likely to experience delays, enabling airlines and airports to take proactive measures to minimize disruptions and improve overall travel experiences.
