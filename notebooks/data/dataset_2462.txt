The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published, followed by subsequent reports, and the latest one, which ranks countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations on International Day of Happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations, and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.

Leading experts across various fields, including economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy, and more, describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll, which is known as the Cantril ladder. This question asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a ten and the worst possible life being zero, and to rate their own current lives on that scale.

The scores are from nationally representative samples and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

These factors have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others. The Country, Region, Happiness Rank, Happiness Score, Standard Error, Economy, Family, Health, Freedom, Trust, Generosity, and Dystopia Residual metrics provide valuable insights into the happiness levels of different countries.
