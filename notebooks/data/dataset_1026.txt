The Grub Damage dataset has been modified to create a binarized version of the original data set. This alteration involves converting the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. To achieve this, the majority class has been relabeled as Positive and all other classes have been relabeled as Negative.

Originally, this conversion was performed on the dataset. The resulting features include Year Zone, Year, Strip, PDK, Damage Rank RJT, Damage Rank All, Dry or Irrigation, Zone, and Binary Class.
