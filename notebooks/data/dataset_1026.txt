Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: year zone, year, strip, pdk, damage rank RJT, damage rank ALL, dry or irrigated, zone, binary class

This dataset focuses on grub damage in agricultural settings, providing information on various factors related to the occurrence and severity of grub infestations. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, simplifying the original multi-class structure. This modification allows for easier analysis and modeling of grub damage patterns. The features included in the dataset cover temporal and spatial aspects, as well as damage assessments and environmental conditions. Researchers and agricultural professionals can utilize this information to better understand and predict grub damage in different zones and under various circumstances.
