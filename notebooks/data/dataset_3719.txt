Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3, Text & Literature 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one hundred thousand fifty-two, and it has twenty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature molecule chembl id and median pxc fifty.

The features represent fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings they were obtained using the pipeline pilot program dassault systemes biobia generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id.

The dataset contains QSAR data from chembl version seventeen showing activity values unit is pseudo pci fifty of several compounds on drug target tid one hundred thousand fifty-two.

This dataset is part of the metaqsar project september two thousand fifteen please cite this dataset when using it for any publication or presentation.
