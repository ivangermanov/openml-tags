QSAR-TID-100052 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100052. The dataset has twenty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100052. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. The dataset has twenty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type two pol protein, which is a single protein target. The protein is classified as an enzyme, protease, aspartic protease, and aspartic protease AA clan, aspartic protease A2A subfamily. The protein has various functions, including nucleic acid binding, DNA binding, catalytic activity, RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity, aspartic-type endopeptidase activity, nuclease activity, endonuclease activity, RNA-DNA hybrid ribonuclease activity, exoribonuclease H activity, peptidase activity, zinc ion binding, transferase activity, nucleotidyltransferase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including RNA-templated DNA biosynthetic process, DNA recombination, proteolysis, metabolic process, DNA integration, viral genome integration into host DNA, viral entry into host cell, and establishment of integrated proviral latency.
