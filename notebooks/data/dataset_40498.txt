Title: Wine Quality

Sources Created: 2009

Past Usage: The dataset was used to model wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. Two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests, such as pH values, and the output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between zero, very bad, and ten, very excellent. Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the best results. Several metrics were computed, including mean absolute deviation and confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance. Also, the relative importances of the input variables were plotted, as measured by a sensitivity analysis procedure.

Relevant Information: The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the Vinho Verde website or the reference provided. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available, excluding data about grape types, wine brand, and wine selling price. These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, it could be interesting to test feature selection methods, as not all input variables may be relevant.

Attribute Information: The input variables are based on physicochemical tests, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The output variable is based on sensory data, which is the quality score between zero and ten.

Missing Attribute Values: None

Dataset Information: The dataset has no missing values and can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.
