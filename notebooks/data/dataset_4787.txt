Within robotics, Inverse Dynamics Algorithms are used to calculate the torques that a robot's motors must deliver to make the robot's endpoint move in the way prescribed by its current task. This is a crucial aspect of robotic control, as it enables robots to perform complex movements and tasks with precision and accuracy.

The Sarcos dataset consists of forty-five thousand data points, collected at one hundred hertz from an actual robot performing various rhythmic and discrete movement tasks. This corresponds to seven point five minutes of data collection. The task is to map from a twenty-one dimensional input space, comprising seven joint positions, seven joint velocities, and seven joint accelerations, to the corresponding seven joint torques.

The attributes within this dataset include seven joint positions, seven joint velocities, seven joint accelerations, and seven joint torques, which serve as the target variables. One of these joint torques will be taken as the target feature, while the others will be ignored as alternate target features.
