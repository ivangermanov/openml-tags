QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median activity values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on the Prostanoid EP receptor, also known as PGE receptor EP subtype, Prostaglandin E receptor EP subtype, and Ptger. This protein is classified as a membrane receptor in the Family A G protein-coupled receptor category, specifically a small molecule receptor and lipid-like ligand receptor within the prostanoid receptor family.

The target protein is found in Rattus norvegicus and is associated with various cellular components including the plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, neuronal cell body, and neuron projection terminus. Its functions include G protein-coupled receptor activity, prostanoid receptor activity, and prostaglandin receptor activity.

The protein is involved in numerous biological processes, such as regulation of cytokine production, inflammatory response, immune response, signal transduction, cell population proliferation, and response to various stimuli including xenobiotics, mechanical stress, and organic cyclic compounds. It plays roles in ossification, smooth muscle cell migration, T-helper cell differentiation, and regulation of various interleukins and tumor necrosis factor production.

Additionally, the protein participates in processes related to circadian rhythms, urine volume regulation, bone development, wound healing, and various cellular responses to stimuli such as glucose, interleukin, and prostaglandin E. It is also involved in the regulation of substance P secretion, matrix metallopeptidase secretion, and ovarian follicle development.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is intended for use in quantitative structure-activity relationship studies. Researchers using this dataset are encouraged to cite the original source.
