The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

These datasets are named according to their characteristics, specifically the degree of colinearity and the number of samples and features they contain. 

Friedman functions are commonly used for generating data and include both linear and nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs, with a normalized noise added to the output. 

The original Friedman function includes five features for input and takes the form of an equation, which combines sine and squared terms with a noise term. 

To assess the impact of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets, which are independent of the output. 

Furthermore, to evaluate an algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with varying degrees of colinearity, which refers to the number of features dependent on other features. 

The parameters and values of the generated Friedman datasets are as follows: the number of features ranges from five to one hundred, although only the first five features are actually related to the output, while the remaining features are entirely random; the number of samples varies from one hundred to one thousand; and the colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For datasets with a high degree of colinearity, the number of features is limited to ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one hundred. Other datasets may contain five, ten, twenty-five, or fifty features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample sizes, and colinearity degrees.
