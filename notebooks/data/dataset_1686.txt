QSAR-TID-101324 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101324. The dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it was created in September 2015. It is recommended to cite the dataset when using it for research purposes.

The dataset provides information about the Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase seven, also known as MAP three K seven or TAK one. It is a single protein that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/TKL protein kinase group/TKL protein kinase MLK family/TKL protein kinase TAK one subfamily. 

The protein is involved in various biological processes, including the MAPK cascade, response to hypoxia, stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of T cell cytokine production, cytosolic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway, and MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway. 

It is also involved in chromatin remodeling, protein phosphorylation, apoptotic process, inflammatory response, signal transduction, transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway, I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, and JNK cascade.
