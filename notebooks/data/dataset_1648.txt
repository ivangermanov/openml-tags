This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Alpha One A Adrenergic Receptor, and it has multiple rows and numerous features representing FCFP molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The features do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. They include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC Fifty.

The dataset was obtained through the MetaQSAR project in September and contains information about the Alpha One A Adrenergic Receptor, which is a single protein with multiple synonyms including ADRA One A, Alpha One A Adrenoreceptor, and others.

The receptor is primarily found in the Oryctolagus cuniculus species group and belongs to the one membrane receptor family, specifically the small molecule receptor subfamily, and the monoamine receptor sub-subfamily.

The receptor is described as having multiple relationships, including being a component of the nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, caveola, membrane, nuclear membrane, and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle.

It also has multiple functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity, adrenergic receptor activity, alpha one adrenergic receptor activity, and protein heterodimerization activity.

Furthermore, the receptor is involved in various biological processes, including the MAPK cascade, negative regulation of heart rate involved in baroreceptor response to increased systemic arterial blood pressure, norepinephrine-epinephrine vasoconstriction involved in regulation of systemic arterial blood pressure, positive regulation of heart rate by epinephrine-norepinephrine, and many others.
