Classify a Chess Game Based on the Position of the White King, the White Rook, and the Black King

This machine learning model aims to categorize a chess game according to the specific locations of three critical pieces on the board: the White King, the White Rook, and the Black King. The model takes into account several key factors, including the column and row positions of each piece.

The following features are used to train the model:

* The Column Position of the White King
* The Row Position of the White King
* The Column Position of the White Rook
* The Row Position of the White Rook
* The Column Position of the Black King
* The Row Position of the Black King
* The Overall Game Situation
