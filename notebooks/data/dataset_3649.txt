QSAR-TID-30025 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30025. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the protein target Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase PAK One, which is a single protein target. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell signaling, cell migration, and cell proliferation.

The protein target is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase, and is part of the STE protein kinase group/STE protein kinase STE20 family/STE protein kinase PAKA subfamily.

The dataset is useful for researchers studying the activity of compounds on this protein target, and can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
