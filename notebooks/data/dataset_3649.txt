The QSAR-TID-30025 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 30025. It has numerous rows and features, including IDs and class feature, representing FCFP 1024bit molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets. It provides valuable information for researchers studying the relationship between molecular structures and their biological activities.

The features in this dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are widely used in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling. These fingerprints capture the structural characteristics of molecules and are essential for predicting their biological properties.

The dataset also includes information about the target protein, Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase PAK One, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Understanding the interaction between small molecules and this protein is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies.

In addition to the molecular descriptors and target information, the dataset provides access to various resources, including Gene Ontology annotations, UniProt identifiers, and Reactome pathways. These resources enable researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biology and develop more effective computational models.
