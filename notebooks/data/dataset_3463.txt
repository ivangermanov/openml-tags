QSAR-TID-104260 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 104260. The dataset has seventy-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 104260. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Free Fatty Acid Receptor one, which is a single protein target that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion.

The Free Fatty Acid Receptor one is a G-protein coupled receptor that is activated by free fatty acids, leading to the activation of various downstream signaling pathways. It is involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and lipid metabolism.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on the development of novel therapeutic compounds targeting the Free Fatty Acid Receptor one. It can be used for QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and lead optimization, among other applications.
