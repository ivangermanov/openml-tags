The Austin Weather dataset is designed to complement the Austin Bikesharing dataset. This comprehensive collection of data contains information on various weather conditions, including temperature, dew point, humidity, sea level pressure, visibility, wind speed, and precipitation.

The dataset consists of daily records from December twenty-first to July thirty-first, providing a detailed account of the weather patterns during this period. Each record includes the following features: Date, High Temperature, Average Temperature, Low Temperature, High Dew Point, Average Dew Point, Low Dew Point, High Humidity, Average Humidity, Low Humidity, High Sea Level Pressure, Average Sea Level Pressure, Low Sea Level Pressure, High Visibility, Average Visibility, Low Visibility, High Wind Speed, Average Wind Speed, Highest Wind Gust, Total Precipitation, and Adverse Weather Events.

This dataset is particularly useful for analyzing the impact of weather conditions on bikesharing patterns. By combining these datasets, researchers can explore how different weather factors influence the demand for bikesharing services.

The Austin Weather dataset was sourced from Weather Underground, specifically from the Austin KATT station. This reliable source provides accurate and comprehensive weather data, making it an ideal resource for research and analysis.
