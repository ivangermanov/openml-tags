Please cite: This dataset contains hip measurement data from Table B in Chatfield's Problem Solving (Second Edition, Chapman and Hall). The data is presented in eight columns. The first four columns represent the Control Group, while the last four columns represent the Treatment Group. It is important to note that there is no pairing between the groups, meaning that Patient in the Control Group does not correspond to Patient in the Treatment Group.

The hip measurement data provides valuable information for statistical analysis and comparison between control and treatment groups. Researchers and statisticians can utilize this dataset to investigate the effects of various interventions or treatments on hip measurements. The inclusion of both control and treatment groups allows for comprehensive comparative studies.

This dataset serves as a useful resource for those interested in exploring hip-related measurements and their potential variations between different groups. It can be employed in various fields, including medical research, biomechanics, and statistical analysis.
