Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Dataset

Tags: Unknown Source, Date Unknown

This dataset is a follow-up to the original Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) dataset, as discussed in a prominent statistical analysis book. An analysis based on the enclosed data is found in a hepatology journal article. The dataset contains information from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver conducted over a ten-year period.

A total of PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo-controlled trial of a specific drug. The first group of cases in the dataset participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data. The additional cases did not participate in the clinical trial but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival. A few of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis.

The dataset contains multiple laboratory results, but only on the first group of patients. Some baseline data values in this file differ from the original PBC file, for instance, data errors in prothrombin time and age which were discovered after the original analysis. Another major difference is that there was significantly more follow-up for many of the patients at the time this dataset was assembled.

One notable feature of the data deserves special comment. The last observation before death or liver transplant often has many more missing covariates than other data rows. The original clinical protocol for these patients specified visits at regular intervals. At these protocol visits, lab values were obtained for a large pre-specified battery of tests. Extra visits, often undertaken because of worsening medical condition, did not necessarily have all this lab work. The missing values are thus potentially informative and violate the usual missing at random assumptions that are assumed in analyses.

The dataset includes variables such as case number, number of days between registration and outcome, status (alive, transplanted, or dead), drug treatment, age, sex, visit dates, presence of various symptoms (ascites, hepatomegaly, spiders, edema), and various laboratory test results (serum bilirubin, serum cholesterol, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, platelets, prothrombin time). It also includes the histologic stage of the disease.

This dataset provides valuable information for studying the progression and outcomes of primary biliary cirrhosis, as well as the effects of various factors on patient survival and disease progression.
