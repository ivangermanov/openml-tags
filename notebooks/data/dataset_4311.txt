**Meta Album Fungi Dataset Extended**

The Meta Album Fungi dataset is created by sampling the Danish Fungi dataset, itself a sampling of the Atlas of Danish Fungi repository. This dataset consists of images and labels sourced by a group of citizen botanists, then verified by their peers using a ranking system based on individual reliability, and finally verified by experts working at the Atlas.

Of the one hundred twenty-eight classes in the original Danish Fungi dataset, the Meta Album Fungi dataset retains the twenty-five most populous classes, belonging to six genera, for a total of fifteen thousand one hundred twenty-two images. Each image contains a colored one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixel image of a fungus or a piece of a fungus from the corresponding class.

Because the initial data were of widely varying sizes, a significant portion of the images had to be cropped. This was implemented by taking the largest possible square with its center at the middle of the initial image. Then, each squared image was scaled to the one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight standard using the Inter Area anti-aliasing filter from Open CV.
