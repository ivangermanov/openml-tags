Note: This dataset is not the original UCI dataset. It has some discretized features. See version for the original.

The prediction task for this dataset is to determine whether an individual earns over fifty thousand dollars annually. The data was extracted from the Census database, focusing on a set of reasonably clean records that met specific conditions related to age, adjusted gross income, final weight, and hours worked per week.

This dataset, which is used for data mining and visualization purposes, contains various features including age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours worked per week, and native country. The class feature indicates whether an individual's income exceeds the fifty thousand dollar threshold.

The dataset provides valuable information for analyzing income levels based on various demographic and socioeconomic factors. It has been widely used in machine learning and data mining research, particularly for testing and comparing the performance of different classification algorithms.
