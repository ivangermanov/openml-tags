APS Failure Dataset

This dataset is used for the 2016 IDA Industrial Challenge, courtesy of Scania. For a full description, see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/IDA2016Challenge. This dataset contains both the train and test sets provided. The first sixty thousand samples are the train set, and the last sixteen thousand samples are the test set. Data was published under the GNU General Public License version three license.

Features: class, and anonymized operational data. The operational data have an identifier and a bin id, like Identifier Bin.

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system, which generates pressurized air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The dataset's positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the Air Pressure system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the Air Pressure system. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.

The challenge metric is a cost-metric of misclassification. Predicted class versus true class has a cost of ten for type one failure and five hundred for type two failure. The total cost of a prediction model is the sum of the cost of type one failure multiplied by the number of instances with type one failure and the cost of type two failure multiplied by the number of instances with type two failure, resulting in a total cost.

The dataset has a total of one hundred seventy-one attributes, of which seven are histogram variables. Missing values are denoted by 'not available'.
