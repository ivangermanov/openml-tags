Consumer Price Indices (CPI) measure changes over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. They are widely used as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation, serving as a tool for governments and central banks to target inflation and monitor price stability, as well as being employed as deflators in national accounts.

The significance of CPI lies in its role as an essential economic indicator, influencing various aspects of the economy. One notable application of CPI is its use in indexing dearness allowance to employees to compensate for increases in prices.

To construct accurate CPI numbers, two crucial components are required: weighting diagrams, which represent consumption patterns, and price data collected at regular intervals.

The dataset, Group Wise All India Consumer Price Index for Rural and Urban Areas, provides valuable insights into the dynamics of consumer prices across different sectors. This comprehensive dataset is published by the Central Statistical Office and updated monthly.

The various categories included in this dataset encompass a broad range of goods and services, including food items, beverages, clothing, housing, healthcare, transportation, education, and more. These categories provide a detailed understanding of the changes in consumer prices and their implications for the overall economy.
