Consumer Price Indices (CPI) measure changes over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. The CPI numbers are widely used as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation, as a tool by governments and central banks for inflation targeting and for monitoring price stability, and as deflators in the national accounts. The CPI is also used for indexing dearness allowance to employees for an increase in prices. Therefore, the CPI is considered one of the most important economic indicators.

For the construction of CPI numbers, two requisite components are weighting diagrams, which represent consumption patterns, and price data collected at regular intervals. The data refers to the group-wise all-India Consumer Price Index for Rural and Urban areas. The dataset is published by the Central Statistical Office and released on a monthly basis.

The Consumer Price Index is a comprehensive measure that takes into account various sectors, including food and beverages, clothing, housing, fuel and light, household goods and services, health, transport and communication, recreation and amusement, education, personal care and effects, and miscellaneous.
