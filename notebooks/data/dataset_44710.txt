Amazon Employee Access Seed Two Dataset 

Tags: Subsampling of the Amazon Employee Access dataset 

This dataset is a subsample of the original Amazon Employee Access dataset. It was generated using a specific set of arguments, including a seed value, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean indicating whether to use stratification.

The subsampling process involved several steps. First, the unique classes in the target variable were identified and sampled uniformly to select the desired number of classes. The indices corresponding to these classes were then used to subset the data. Next, the columns were sampled uniformly to select the desired number of columns. Finally, the rows were sampled using stratification based on the target variable to select the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset consists of the subsetted data, along with metadata including the categorical mask and column names.
