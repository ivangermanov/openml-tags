Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Amazon Employee Access, generated with a specific set of arguments

This dataset is a subsample of the original Amazon Employee Access dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, selecting a subset of columns, and then further subsampling the resulting dataset to meet the specified requirements.

The subsampling process began by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling from the unique classes present in the dataset, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, retaining only the rows where one of the selected classes was present.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled, selecting a subset of columns to retain. This was done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve its manageability.

Finally, the resulting dataset was further subsampled to meet the specified requirements. This involved stratified sampling, where the dataset was split into subsets based on the target variable, and then sampling from each subset to achieve the desired number of rows.

The resulting dataset consists of the following features: Resource, Manager ID, Role Rollup One, Role Rollup Two, Role Department Name, Role Title, Role Family Description, Role Family, and Role Code, as well as the target variable.
