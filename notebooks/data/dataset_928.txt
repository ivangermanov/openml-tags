Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a binarized adaptation of an original dataset from an unknown source. The primary modification involves transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This conversion results in a two-class nominal target feature, simplifying the classification task. The dataset retains its original structure with multiple columns of data, concluding with a binary class designation. Researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems or comparative studies between numeric and categorical target variables may find this dataset particularly useful.
