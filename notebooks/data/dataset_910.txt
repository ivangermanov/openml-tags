This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It has been modified to convert the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. The dataset includes various features, including certain ozone-related variables. The binary classification system allows for a more straightforward analysis of the data.
