Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset represents a binarized regression problem, created from an original dataset of unknown origin. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a binary classification problem. This was achieved by calculating the mean value of the target feature and then categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean. Instances with target values below the mean were classified as positive ('P'), while those above or equal to the mean were classified as negative ('N'). This binarization technique allows for the application of classification algorithms to what was originally a regression task. The dataset includes multiple 'oz' features, which likely represent different measurements or attributes related to the problem domain. The final feature, 'binary Class', represents the transformed target variable resulting from the binarization process.
