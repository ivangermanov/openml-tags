The RSCTC 2010 Three dataset is a collection of DNA microarray data characterized by values of attributes. This dataset contains gene expression data with samples assigned to several classes. All attributes are numeric and represent measurements from DNA microarrays.

This dataset was obtained from the RSCTC 2010 Discovery Challenge, which provides example datasets for six different problems of DNA microarray data analysis and classification. The dataset features various variables, including gene expressions, that are essential for understanding the underlying biological processes.

The RSCTC 2010 Three dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on DNA microarray data analysis and classification. It provides a comprehensive set of gene expression data that can be used to develop and test new algorithms and models.
