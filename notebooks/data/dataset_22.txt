Multiple Features Dataset: Zernike
Tags: OpenML-CC, OpenML, study, uci

This dataset is part of a collection of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (zero to nine) extracted from Dutch utility maps. The digits were digitized into binary images, with two hundred instances per class, totaling two thousand instances. In this particular dataset, the digits are represented using forty-seven Zernike moments, which are rotation invariant.

The Zernike moments cannot distinguish between samples of the digit 'six' and 'nine'. For more detailed information on Zernike moments, interested parties can refer to the work presented at the International Conference on Pattern Recognition in Rome.

The dataset has been utilized in various research papers, including studies on handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers and statistical pattern recognition reviews. These studies have explored the effectiveness of different feature sets and classification methods for digit recognition tasks.

The complete Multiple Features Dataset includes six feature sets: Fourier coefficients of character shapes, profile correlations, Karhunen-Love coefficients, pixel averages in windows, Zernike moments, and morphological features. Each feature set is stored in a separate file, with patterns from different feature sets corresponding to the same original character.

It's worth noting that the source image dataset has been lost, but sampled versions of the original images can be reconstructed using the pixel dataset at a resolution of fifteen by sixteen pixels.

The dataset does not contain any missing values, making it suitable for various machine learning and pattern recognition tasks without the need for extensive data preprocessing to handle incomplete information.
