Subsampling of the dataset Dionis with a specified seed value, number of rows, number of columns, number of classes, and whether to stratify the sampling.

This dataset has been generated through a subsampling process of the original Dionis dataset, which consisted of forty-one thousand one hundred sixty-seven instances. The subsampling was done using a specified seed value of three, which ensures reproducibility of the results.

The maximum number of rows in the subsampled dataset was set to two thousand, which is significantly smaller than the original dataset. This reduction in size allows for faster processing and analysis of the data.

In addition to reducing the number of rows, the number of columns was also limited to one hundred. This reduction in dimensionality helps to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce the complexity of the data.

Furthermore, the number of classes was limited to ten, which is significantly smaller than the number of unique classes in the original dataset. This reduction in the number of classes helps to simplify the classification problem and improve the accuracy of the models.

The subsampling process was performed in a stratified manner, meaning that the samples were drawn from each class in proportion to its frequency in the original dataset. This ensures that the subsampled dataset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The resulting dataset consists of one hundred features, including both numerical and categorical variables. The categorical variables have been converted to strings to ensure compatibility with OpenML.
