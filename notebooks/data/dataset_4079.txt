QSAR-TID-103106 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103106. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103106. The features of the dataset represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists who want to study the activity of compounds on drug target TID: 103106.

The dataset contains information about the Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase four, which is a single protein and a preferred name. It is also known as HIPK four and is found in Homo sapiens. The protein is classified as an enzyme, kinase, and protein kinase, and is part of the CMGC protein kinase group and the CMGC protein kinase DYRK family.

The protein has various functions, including nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and histone kinase activity. It is involved in various biological processes, including chromatin remodeling, protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, histone modification, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation, protein autophosphorylation, and regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator.
