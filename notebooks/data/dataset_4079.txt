QSAR-TID-103106 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103106. The data was obtained from ChEMBL version seventeen and consists of six hundred sixty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes features such as molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

QSAR-TID-103106 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, published in September two thousand fifteen.

Keywords: QSAR, MetaQSAR, ChEMBL, molecular fingerprints, SMILES strings, Pipeline Pilot, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.
