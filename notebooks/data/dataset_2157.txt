QSAR-TID-12965 Dataset 

Tags: Agriculture, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12965, and it has seventy-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule chembl id, fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four zero, fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four one, fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four two, and so on up to fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four nine hundred twenty-five, and median pxc fifty.

The nociceptin receptor, also known as kappa-type three opioid receptor, kor-three, and oor, is a single protein preferred name and its synonyms include kappa-type three opioid receptor, kor-three, nociceptin receptor, oor, and oprl. It belongs to the species group rattus norvegicus and its protein target classification is one membrane receptor family a g protein-coupled receptor peptide receptor family a gpcr short peptide receptor family a gpcr opioid receptor.

The nociceptin receptor is described as having relationships with accession p three five three seventy, go component plasma membrane, go component membrane, go component cytoplasmic vesicle, go component neuron projection, go function nociceptin receptor activity, go function g protein-coupled receptor activity, go function g protein-coupled opioid receptor activity, go function protein binding, go function neuropeptide binding, and so on up to go process response to estradiol, go process positive regulation of urine volume, go process g protein-coupled opioid receptor signaling pathway, and many more.

It is also mentioned in expression atlas, go component, go function, go process, can sar-target, guide to pharmacology, reactome, uniprot, interpro, and pfam.
