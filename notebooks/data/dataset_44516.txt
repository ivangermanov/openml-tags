Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It uses the numpy random default random generator to select a random subset of the data. The function first selects a random subset of classes, then selects a random subset of columns, and finally selects a random subset of rows. The stratified argument determines whether the sampling should be stratified or not.

The function uses the pandas library to manipulate the data. It first selects the unique classes in the dataset and then selects a random subset of these classes. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to select the corresponding rows and columns from the dataset. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum number of columns, it selects a random subset of columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum number of rows, it uses the train test split function from scikit learn to select a stratified random subset of rows.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data.
