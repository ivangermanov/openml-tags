The QSAR-TID-101361 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101361. This dataset has three hundred twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It is tagged under economics, life science, and MTL QSAR.

The dataset contains information about the drug target, including its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, protein target classification, and description. The preferred name of the target is trace amine-associated receptor one, and its synonyms include TA one, TAAR one, and Tar one. The target belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a single protein belonging to family A G protein-coupled receptor.

The dataset also provides information about the molecules, including their ChEMBL ID, parent molecule name, parent molecule type, mechanism of action, max phase, and first approval. Additionally, it provides access to various databases, including PubMed, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, and InterPro.
