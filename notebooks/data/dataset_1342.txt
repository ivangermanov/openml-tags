QSAR-TID-12863 Tags: Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Social Media, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12863. The features represent FCFP 1024 bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset contains thirty rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature, namely MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
