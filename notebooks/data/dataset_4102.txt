Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the regression on categorical and numerical features benchmark.

Original Description:

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process, from membership to rental and return, has become automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from one position and return it at another. Currently, there are over five hundred bike-sharing programs worldwide, comprising more than five hundred thousand bicycles. There exists a great interest in these systems due to their crucial role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health issues. 

Apart from their fascinating real-world applications, the characteristics of the data generated by these systems make them appealing for research purposes. Unlike other transportation services, such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature transforms bike sharing systems into a virtual sensor network capable of sensing urban mobility. Consequently, it is anticipated that most significant events within a city could be detected through monitoring this data.

The bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated with environmental and seasonal settings. Factors such as weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and hour of the day can significantly influence rental behavior. 

The core dataset is derived from a two-year historical log, corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012, from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA, which is publicly accessible. The data have been aggregated on an hourly and daily basis, with corresponding weather and seasonal information subsequently extracted and added. Weather information was obtained from Freemeteo.
