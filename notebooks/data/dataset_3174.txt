Name: QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is associated with the MetaQSAR project from September. It focuses on the L type amino acid transporter, also known as FLC, F LC, F light chain, Integral membrane protein E, and Large neutral amino acids transporter small subunit. This protein is found in Rattus norvegicus and belongs to the Transporter/Electrochemical transporter/SLC superfamily of solute carriers, specifically the SLC and SLC families of heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs)/SLC Cationic amino acid transporter/glycoprotein associated family.

The protein is involved in various cellular components including lysosomes, plasma membranes, and amino acid transport complexes. Its functions include amino acid transmembrane transporter activity, aromatic amino acid transmembrane transporter activity, and peptide antigen binding. The protein participates in numerous biological processes such as amino acid transport, regulation of autophagy, response to muscle activity, and cellular responses to various stimuli including glucose starvation and lipopolysaccharide.

Cross references for this target are provided in several databases including canSAR Target, IntAct, MICAD, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam. The dataset aims to facilitate quantitative structure activity relationship studies for this important transporter protein.
