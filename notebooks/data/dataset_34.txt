Postoperative Patient Data
Tags: study_1, study_41, uci

The classification task of this database is to determine where patients in a postoperative recovery area should be sent next. Hypothermia is a significant concern after surgery, so the attributes correspond roughly to body temperature measurements. The LERS (LEM2) algorithm achieved 48% accuracy on this dataset.

The dataset contains information on patients' internal and surface temperatures, oxygen saturation levels, blood pressure, stability of surface and core temperatures, blood pressure stability, and perceived comfort at discharge. The discharge decision, which is the target variable, has three possible outcomes: patient sent to Intensive Care Unit, patient prepared to go home, or patient sent to general hospital floor.

Attribute information includes:

L CORE (patient's internal temperature in Celsius): categorized as high, mid, or low
L SURF (patient's surface temperature in Celsius): categorized as high, mid, or low
L O2 (oxygen saturation in percentage): categorized as excellent, good, fair, or poor
L BP (last measurement of blood pressure): categorized as high, mid, or low
SURF STBL (stability of patient's surface temperature): stable, moderately stable, or unstable
CORE STBL (stability of patient's core temperature): stable, moderately stable, or unstable
BP STBL (stability of patient's blood pressure): stable, moderately stable, or unstable
COMFORT (patient's perceived comfort at discharge): measured as an integer between 0 and 20

The dataset contains 90 instances and 9 attributes, including the decision attribute. There are missing values in the COMFORT attribute. The class distribution is heavily imbalanced, with the majority of patients being sent to the general hospital floor.

This dataset has been used in various studies related to knowledge acquisition in nursing and the development of expert systems in healthcare. It provides valuable insights into postoperative patient care and decision-making processes in medical settings.
