Description:
The One Hundred Plant Species Leaves dataset focuses on the classification of plant leaves based on their shape.

The dataset consists of binary images of leaf samples, with each image represented by three features: shape, margin, and texture. For each feature, a sixty-four element vector is provided per leaf sample. These vectors are taken as a contiguous descriptor for shape or histograms for texture and margin.

The dataset includes three separate files, each corresponding to a specific feature problem: shape, texture, and margin. Each row in these files contains a sixty-four element feature vector followed by the class label. There are a total of sixteen hundred samples, with sixteen samples per leaf class, and no missing values.

Attributes Information:
The dataset includes three sixty-four element feature vectors per sample.
