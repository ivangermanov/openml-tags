Volcanoes on Venus - JARtool Experiment Data Set

Experiment: E2

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Study Seven

Dataset Information:
The data was collected by the Magellan spacecraft over a period of approximately four years from nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety-four. The primary objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar. A more detailed discussion of the mission and its objectives is available at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Magellan webpage.

There exist certain spatial dependencies within the data. For instance, background patches extracted from within a single image are likely to exhibit greater similarity compared to background patches extracted from different images. In addition to the images, there are ground truth files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. It is essential to note that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set, as no human has visited Venus, and the image quality does not permit one hundred percent, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by expert humans. These labels provide a measure of subjective uncertainty, with one indicating definite volcanic presence, two indicating probable presence, three indicating possible presence, and four indicating only pit visibility. 

Attribute Information:
The images consist of one thousand twenty-four by one thousand twenty-four pixels. The pixel values fall within the range of zero to two hundred fifty-five. The pixel value is directly related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a specific spatial location. Higher pixel values signify greater backscatter, whereas lower pixel values signify lesser backscatter. Both topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength have a profound impact on the amount of backscatter.
