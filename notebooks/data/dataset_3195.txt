QSAR-TID-100857 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100857. The dataset has rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100857. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. This program is used to generate Fingerprints, which does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development.

The dataset contains information about the G-protein coupled bile acid receptor one, which is a single protein target. The receptor is also known as BG thirty-seven, GPBAR one, and G-protein coupled receptor. It is a membrane receptor that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in the signal transduction pathway.

The receptor is expressed in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of cells and is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell surface bile acid receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of ERK one and ERK two cascade, and regulation of bicellular tight junction assembly.
