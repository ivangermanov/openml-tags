Blocks Dataset Information

The dataset consists of examples from fifty-four distinct documents, with each observation concerning one block. All attributes are numeric and are in a format readable by C4.5. There are no missing values in the dataset.

Additional Variable Information

The dataset includes the following variables:

* Height of the block, which is an integer value representing the block's height.
* Length of the block, which is an integer value representing the block's length.
* Area of the block, which is an integer value calculated by multiplying the height and length of the block.
* Eccentricity of the block, which is a continuous value representing the block's eccentricity, calculated by dividing the length by the height.
* Percentage of black pixels within the block, which is a continuous value representing the percentage of black pixels in the original bitmap of the block, calculated by dividing the total number of black pixels by the area of the block.
* Percentage of black pixels after the application of the Run Length Smoothing Algorithm, which is a continuous value representing the percentage of black pixels in the bitmap of the block after the algorithm is applied, calculated by dividing the total number of black pixels after the algorithm by the area of the block.
* Mean number of white-black transitions, which is a continuous value representing the mean number of white-black transitions in the original bitmap of the block, calculated by dividing the total number of black pixels by the number of white-black transitions.
* Total number of black pixels in the original bitmap of the block, which is an integer value.
* Total number of black pixels in the bitmap of the block after the Run Length Smoothing Algorithm, which is an integer value.
* Number of white-black transitions in the original bitmap of the block, which is an integer value.
