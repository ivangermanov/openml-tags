Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer (WPBC) Dataset

Tags: OpenML-Reg19

Source: Unknown

This dataset contains follow-up data for breast cancer cases, focusing on patients with invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. The data is derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, with features describing characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images.

The dataset has been used in various publications related to prognostic prediction, breast cancer diagnosis, and machine learning applications in medical imaging. It presents two potential learning problems: predicting the outcome (recurrent or nonrecurrent) and predicting the time to recurrence.

The features are computed from the FNA images and include measurements such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension. For each feature, the mean, standard error, and "worst" (mean of the three largest values) were calculated, resulting in 30 features. Additional attributes include tumor size and lymph node status.

The dataset comprises 198 instances with 34 attributes, including an ID number, outcome, time, and 32 real-valued input features. The class distribution is 151 nonrecurrent cases and 47 recurrent cases. Lymph node status is missing in four cases.

Various machine learning techniques have been applied to this dataset, including Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) and Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA). These methods have been used to predict recurrence and time to recurrence with varying degrees of accuracy.

The dataset has been instrumental in developing computerized breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis tools, as well as in exploring the application of image analysis and machine learning to medical diagnostics. It represents an important resource for researchers in the fields of oncology, medical imaging, and artificial intelligence.
