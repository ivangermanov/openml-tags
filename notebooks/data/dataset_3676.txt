QSAR-TID-214 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 214. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is related to the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M4, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission.

The receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor, which is a type of membrane receptor that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling. The receptor is involved in the regulation of locomotion and is a target for various drugs, including Xanomeline, which is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 agonist.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M4.
