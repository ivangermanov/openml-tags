QSAR-TID-10850 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10850. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature, representing FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA, and generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID and many others.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.
