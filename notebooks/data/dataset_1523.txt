Dataset Title: Vertebra Column - Three Classes

Abstract: This data set contains values for six biomechanical features used to classify orthopedic patients into three classes (normal, disk hernia, or spondylolisthesis) or two classes (normal or abnormal).

Data Set Information: This biomedical data set was built during a medical residence period in the Group of Applied Research in Orthopedics of the Centre Médico-Chirurgical de Réadaptation des Massues, Lyon, France. The data have been organized in two different but related classification tasks. The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of three categories: normal, disk hernia, or spondylolisthesis. For the second task, the categories disk hernia and spondylolisthesis were merged into a single category labeled as abnormal. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of two categories: normal or abnormal.

Attribute Information: Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine, in this order: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is used for the class labels: disk hernia, spondylolisthesis, normal, and abnormal.
