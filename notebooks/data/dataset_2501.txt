This dataset, named Jungle Chess Two Pieces Raw Endgame Complete, is part of a collection of datasets based on the game Jungle Chess, also known as Dou Shou Qi. For a comprehensive description of the rules, please refer to the accompanying paper. The paper also provides an in-depth explanation of the various constructed features.

As the tablebases comprise a disjoint set of multiple tablebases, each based on which two pieces are present on the board, we have uploaded all tablebases that contain explicitly distinct content. These include Rat versus Rat, Rat versus Panther, Rat versus Lion, Rat versus Elephant, Panther versus Lion, Panther versus Elephant, Tiger versus Lion, Lion versus Lion, Lion versus Elephant, and Elephant versus Elephant. Additionally, there are Complete and Raw Complete datasets, which combine the aforementioned datasets and contain only the rank, file, and strength information for both pieces.

This dataset presents a similar classification problem to, for instance, the King and Rook versus King problem and is well-suited for classification tasks. Note that several sub-problems exhibit strong similarities, and having seen a particular position from one of the tablebases provides substantial insight into the outcome of the same position in the other tablebases.
