QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The target is ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase domain containing protein). It is also known as CD antigen=CDb, CSVP, Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein. The organism is Homo sapiens. The protein target classification is Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MAM clan/Metallo protease MB subfamily.

ADAM functions in various biological processes including proteolysis, membrane protein ectodomain proteolysis, cell adhesion, Notch signaling pathway, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, response to xenobiotic stimulus, B cell differentiation, positive regulation of cell migration, response to lipopolysaccharide, T cell differentiation in thymus, wound healing, amyloid precursor protein catabolic process, defense response to Gram positive bacterium, and many others.

It is involved in multiple cellular components including Golgi membrane, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, cytosol, plasma membrane, cell cell junction, focal adhesion, cell surface, actin cytoskeleton, apical plasma membrane, and membrane raft. Its molecular functions include endopeptidase activity, metalloendopeptidase activity, Notch binding, interleukin receptor binding, integrin binding, protein binding, peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, SH domain binding, PDZ domain binding, and metal ion binding.
