This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID one thousand one hundred seventy-three, and it has rows and features including IDs and class feature MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is part of the meta qsar project and was published in september two thousand fifteen.
