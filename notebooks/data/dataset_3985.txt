QSAR-TID-12724 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12724. The dataset has a total of rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular representation that encodes the structural information of a molecule into a binary vector. The fingerprints were generated using the FCFP six algorithm, which is a widely used method for generating molecular fingerprints.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening, as it provides a large collection of molecules with activity values against a specific drug target. The data can be used to train machine learning models to predict the activity of new molecules against the target, or to identify potential lead compounds for further optimization.

The dataset is part of a larger collection of QSAR datasets, which are publicly available for research purposes. The datasets are curated and maintained by a team of experts in the field of cheminformatics and QSAR modeling.
