**Meta-Album Animals with Attributes Dataset Extended**

The original Animals with Attributes two dataset was designed to benchmark transfer-learning algorithms, particularly attribute-based classification and zero-shot learning. It consists of over thirty-seven thousand images from fifty animal classes, where each animal corresponds to a class. The images in this dataset were collected from public sources, such as Flickr, considering only images licensed for free use and redistribution.

Each class can have a varying number of images with resolutions ranging from one hundred by one hundred pixels to one thousand eight hundred ninety-three by one thousand nine hundred twenty pixels. To preprocess this dataset, the images were cropped from either side to make them square. In cases where an image had a resolution lower than one hundred twenty-eight pixels, the squared images were created by either duplicating the top and bottom-most three rows or the left and right-most three columns based on the orientation of the original image. Finally, the square images were resized into one hundred twenty-eight by one hundred twenty-eight pixels using an anti-aliasing filter.
