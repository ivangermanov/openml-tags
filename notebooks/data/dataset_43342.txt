German House Prices
Tags: Context

Projects are a great way to learn data science, and I decided to start my own project. The numerous housing data sets available on Kaggle were the inspiration for this data set. Predicting house prices is a simple yet insightful regression problem that can provide valuable insights into the real estate market. Understanding data takes time, and the more people analyze it, the faster the secrets and patterns can be uncovered.

I acquired the data by scraping Immo Scout 24, a popular marketplace for German real estate. The data set includes a range of features that are relevant to house prices, including the type of property, living space, lot size, usable area, and number of rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Additionally, the data set includes information about the property's condition, heating system, energy source, and energy efficiency class. The location of the property is also an important factor, with features including the state, city, and place.
