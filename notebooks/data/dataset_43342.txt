The German House Prices project was inspired by the numerous housing datasets available on Kaggle, which sparked an interest in exploring the predictive power of machine learning algorithms on this type of data. As predicting house prices is a fundamental yet insightful regression problem, it provides an excellent opportunity to delve into the world of data analysis.

Understanding the intricacies of data requires time and effort, and the collective analysis by multiple individuals can accelerate the discovery of hidden patterns and insights. To gather the necessary data, I resorted to web scraping techniques to collect information from Immo Scout 24, a prominent online marketplace for German real estate.

The resulting dataset comprises a diverse range of features, including property type, living space, lot size, usable area, number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, year built, furnishing quality, year renovated, condition, heating system, energy source, energy certificate, energy consumption, energy efficiency class, state, city, place, garages, and garage type.
