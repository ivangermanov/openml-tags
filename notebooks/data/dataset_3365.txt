This collection includes datasets of one dimensional ultrasound raw radio frequency data, also known as A-Scans, acquired from the biceps brachii muscles of healthy volunteers. The annotation was performed by labeling the initial period of each dataset as belonging to a relaxed muscle state and the latter period of each dataset as belonging to a fatigue muscle state.

Each line of the ARFF file contains an A-Scan consisting of amplitude values, an annotation indicating whether this A-Scan belongs to a fatigue muscle state or not, a timestamp, the position of the arm the signals were obtained from, the identification of the subject, the identification of the dataset, the gender of the subject, and the chosen lifted weight.

Features: amplitude scan, annotation, time stamp, arm position, subject identification, dataset identification, gender, lifted weight

Keywords: Ultrasound Data Study, Muscle Fatigue, Computer Systems, Machine Learning, Radio Frequency Data, Annotation, Amplitude Values, Timestamp, Arm Position, Subject Identification, Dataset Identification, Gender, Lifted Weight.
