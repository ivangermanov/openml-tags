QSAR-TID-10167 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10167. The dataset has eighty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor three, which is a protein target involved in various physiological processes, including cell communication, signal transduction, and synaptic transmission.

The receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating glutamate signaling in the brain. It is involved in various neurological processes, including learning and memory, and has been implicated in several neurological disorders.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers studying the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor three and its role in various physiological processes.
