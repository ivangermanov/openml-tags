Relevant Information

Mining activity is and has always been connected with the occurrence of dangers, which are commonly called mining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard, which frequently occurs in many underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismo acoustic monitoring systems allow a better understanding of rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard prediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is, however, far from perfect. Complexity of seismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number of high-energy phenomena (for example, greater than ten thousand joules) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict seismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction, also using machine learning methods.
