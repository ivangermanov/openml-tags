The Anneal family of products is a type of steel alloy that is known for its high carbon content, which gives it a unique combination of hardness and formability. The temper rolling process used to manufacture Anneal products ensures that they have a consistent condition and surface quality, making them ideal for a variety of applications. One of the key benefits of Anneal products is their non-ageing properties, which means that they will retain their strength and durability over time. The surface finish of Anneal products can be customized to meet specific requirements, including enamelability and a blue bright varnish clean finish. The lustre of Anneal products is also notable, making them a popular choice for applications where appearance is important. Anneal products come in a range of shapes, thicknesses, widths, and lengths, and can be packed with oil or bore to meet specific needs. They are also classified according to their specific properties and applications.
