This dataset explores various aspects of steel products, including their family and type, chemical composition featuring carbon, and physical properties such as hardness, formability, and strength. The temper rolling process and resulting condition also play a crucial role in determining the quality of these products. Furthermore, enamellability, surface finish, and surface quality are essential characteristics that influence their suitability for different applications. Additionally, the dataset examines the geographical origin of these products, specifically British Columbia. The visual appeal of these products is also considered, encompassing aspects such as lustre and blue/bright/varnish/clean finishes. The Jurof Manganese Steel series is another significant aspect of this dataset. The physical dimensions of these products, including shape, thickness, width, length, and bore, are also documented. Finally, the dataset provides information on the packing class and oil used in relation to these products.
