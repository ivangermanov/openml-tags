The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number". 

These Friedman functions include both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: the output equals ten times the sine of pi times the product of the first two inputs plus twenty times the square of the third input minus point five squared equals ten times the fifth input plus five times the sixth input plus the normalized noise.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. 

To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. 

These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. 

Colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies, including only five related to the output, while the rest are completely random.

The number of samples varies.

Colinearity degrees vary from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the numbers of features are generated accordingly. 

The other datasets have varying numbers of features. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
