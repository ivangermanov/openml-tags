The Code Smells Data Class dataset combines records from the Machine Learning Classifier Quality dataset with metrics extracted using the Programming Metrics Database Tool and the Understand Tool, to determine whether a file contains code smells. Please note that the records are on subclass level.

This classification task involves binarizing the default class, which represents the severity of code smells, with a static threshold preferably between moderate and high severity levels.

The dataset includes various features, including repository information, package details, file names, code names, commit hash values, and indicators of code smells. It also includes metrics related to cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, line counts, comment counts, class coupling, inheritance, and cohesion.

These features include repository information, package details, file names, code names, commit hash values, indicators of code smells, average cyclomatic complexity, average essential complexity, average line count, average blank lines, average code lines, average comment lines, count of class bases, count of class couplings, count of derived classes, declaration counts for classes, methods, variables, files, functions, executable units, instance methods, instance variables, and more.

Please carefully read the associated publication to understand how to effectively utilize this dataset for code smell detection tasks.
