Image Tags: Multi-Label Benchmark Paper

The Image dataset is a multi-label benchmark dataset consisting of two thousand natural scene images. Each image is associated with a set of labels, where all possible labels are Desert, Mountains, Sea, Sunset, and Trees. About a quarter of the images belong to more than one class, although images belonging to three classes or more are very rare.

The dataset features a comprehensive set of features, including various characteristics that describe the images. These features are essential in understanding the content and context of each image, enabling accurate classification and labeling.

The Image dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on multi-label classification tasks, providing a challenging and diverse set of images to test and train their models.
