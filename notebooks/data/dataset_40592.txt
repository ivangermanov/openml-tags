The Image dataset is a transportation multi-label dataset consisting of two thousand natural scene images. This dataset was made publicly available as a processed image dataset, with each image being represented by one hundred thirty-five features. Each observation in this dataset can be associated with multiple labels, where all possible labels include desert, mountains, sea, sunset, and trees.

About twenty-two percent of the images in this dataset belong to more than one class. However, images belonging to three classes or more are extremely rare.

Multi-label classification tasks involve predicting multiple labels for a single instance, which makes this dataset suitable for training models capable of handling complex relationships between labels.

The Image dataset provides an opportunity to explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques designed specifically for multi-label classification problems, allowing researchers to evaluate the performance of their models on a diverse range of images.
