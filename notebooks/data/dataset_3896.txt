The QSAR-TID-100824 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100824. This dataset has seventy-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100824.

The drug target is a single protein known as Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase NIM One. Its synonyms include NIM One, NIM One K, and NIM One Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase. The organism is Homo sapiens, and it belongs to the species group. The protein target classification is enzyme kinase protein kinase CAMK protein kinase group CAMK protein kinase CAMK one family CAMK protein kinase NIM One subfamily.

This protein is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, and intracellular signal transduction. It has molecular functions such as nucleotide binding, magnesium ion binding, protein kinase activity, protein serine threonine kinase activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and metal ion binding.
