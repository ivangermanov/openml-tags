The Airfoil Self-Noise dataset was donated by Intelnics Creators from NASA.

**Data Description** 
The NASA dataset comprises different size NACA airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments, which provides a consistent and controlled environment for data collection.

**Attribute Description** 
This problem has the following inputs: 
* Frequency, which represents the rate of oscillation in Hertz.
* Angle of Attack, which is the angle between the airfoil and the oncoming airflow, measured in degrees.
* Chord Length, which is the distance between the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil, measured in meters.
* Free-Stream Velocity, which is the speed of the airflow, measured in meters per second.
* Suction Side Displacement Thickness, which is the thickness of the airfoil's suction side, measured in meters.

The only output is: 
* Scaled Sound Pressure Level, which is a measure of the noise level, measured in decibels.
