The Airfoil Self Noise dataset was donated by Intelnics. It was created by researchers at NASA.

Data Description

The NASA dataset comprises different sized airfoils tested at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position remained constant throughout the experiments.

Attribute Description

This problem involves the following input variables:

* Frequency, which represents the rate of oscillation in Hertz.
* Angle of Attack, which measures the degree of airflow deflection.
* Length, referring to the chord length of the airfoil in meters.
* Velocity, representing the free stream velocity in meters per second.
* Thickness, measuring the suction side displacement thickness in meters.

The sole output variable is:

* Pressure, representing the scaled sound pressure level in decibels.
