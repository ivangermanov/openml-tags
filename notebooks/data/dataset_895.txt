The KC2 dataset is a collection of software defect prediction data from the NASA Metrics Data Program. This dataset contains information about software for science data processing, specifically featuring McCabe and Halstead features extracted from source code. These features were originally defined in the 1970s to objectively characterize code characteristics associated with software quality.

Attribute information includes:

* Line Count of Code, which represents the number of lines in the code
* Cyclomatic Complexity, a measure of the structural complexity of the code
* Essential Complexity, a measure of the amount of decision logic in the code
* Design Complexity, a measure of the modular structure of the code
* Total Operators Plus Operands, a measure of the size of the program
* Volume, a measure of the amount of information in the program
* Program Length, a measure of the size of the program
* Difficulty, a measure of how hard the program is to understand
* Intelligence, a measure of how easy the program is to understand
* Effort, a measure of the amount of work required to complete the program
* Time Estimator, a measure of the time required to complete the program
* Line Count, a measure of the number of lines in the code
* Lines of Comments, a measure of the number of comment lines in the code
* Blank Lines, a measure of the number of empty lines in the code
* Unique Operators, a measure of the number of distinct operators used in the code
* Unique Operands, a measure of the number of distinct operands used in the code
* Total Operators, a measure of the total number of operators used in the code
* Total Operands, a measure of the total number of operands used in the code
* Branch Count, a measure of the number of branches in the control flow graph
* Problems, a binary indicator of whether the module has one or more reported defects

Relevant papers include studies on data quality and software defect datasets, as well as research on predictors of software defects.
