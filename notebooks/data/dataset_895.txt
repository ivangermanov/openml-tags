Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: column one, column two, binary class

This dataset, known as CHSCase Geyser, is a modified version of an original dataset from an unknown source. The modification process involved binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the target values and then categorizing instances as either positive ('P') or negative ('N') based on whether their target value fell below or above this mean, respectively. The dataset is associated with mythbusting and various study-related tags, suggesting its potential use in research or educational contexts. The features included in the dataset are represented by two columns and a binary class designation.
