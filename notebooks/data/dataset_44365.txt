Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments, and returns a dataset. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes from the unique values in the target variable, and selects the indices where one of these classes is present. It then uniformly samples columns if required, and stratifies the data accordingly. The function returns a dataset with the subsampled data, categorical mask, and columns.
