**Hepar2 Bayesian Network. Sample**

The Hepar2 Bayesian network repository reference is available online. This network has a large number of nodes and arcs, resulting in a complex model.

The network consists of seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, with a total of fourteen hundred fifty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, while the average degree is around three point five one. The maximum in-degree of the network is six.

This Bayesian network model was designed to represent probabilistic causal relationships between various medical factors related to liver disorders. It includes features such as anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, international normalized ratio, joint issues, platelet count, VH AMN, spider naevi, spleen health, age, jaundice, HBsAg antibody status, chronic hepatitis, itching, steatosis, sex, history of injections, HBsAg status, cirrhosis, palmar erythema, pain, HCV antibody status, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, alkaline phosphatase, rheumatic hepatitis, gallstones, gamma-glutamyl transferase, primary biliary cholangitis, alanine transaminase, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, aspartate transaminase, HBeAg status, skin health, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, HBC antibody status, right upper quadrant pressure, alcohol consumption, LE cells, antimitochondrial antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites, hospitalization, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, density, blood transfusion, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, liver carcinoma, edge, edema, fatty liver, alcoholism, and surgical history.
