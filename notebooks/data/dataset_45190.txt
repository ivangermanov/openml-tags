The Hepar2 Bayesian Network is a discrete large network repository reference available online. It consists of seventy nodes and one hundred twenty-three arcs, with a total of fourteen hundred fifty-three parameters. The average Markov blanket size is approximately four point five one, while the average degree is three point five one. The maximum in-degree of this network is six.

This Bayesian network is a representation of probabilistic causal models in medicine, specifically applied to the diagnosis of liver disorders. The network features various symptoms and conditions related to liver health, including anorexia, triglyceride levels, consciousness, amylase, hepatotoxicity, INR values, joint issues, platelet counts, VH AMN levels, spider naevi, spleen health, age, jaundice, HBsAg antibody presence, chronic hepatitis, itching sensations, steatosis, sex, injection history, HBsAg presence, cirrhosis, palmar symptoms, pain, HCV antibody presence, encephalopathy, albumin levels, nausea, urea levels, phosphatase levels, rheumatic hepatitis, gallstone presence, GGT levels, primary biliary cirrhosis, ALT levels, bilirubin levels, fibrosis, AST levels, HBeAg presence, skin symptoms, right upper quadrant pain, cholesterol levels, toxic hepatitis, HBC antibody presence, right upper quadrant pressure, alcohol consumption, LE cells presence, AMA presence, ESR levels, hepatomegaly, protein levels, hepatalgia, irregular liver shape, ascites presence, hospitalization history, obesity, diabetes, choledocholithotomy, density measurements, transfusion history, fatigue, flatulence, bleeding, upper abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, carcinoma, edge detection, edema presence, fatty deposits, and alcoholism.
