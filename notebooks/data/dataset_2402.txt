The Birds Dataset is a multi-label dataset consisting of three hundred twenty-seven audio recordings of twelve different vocalizing bird species. Each sound can be assigned to various bird species. 

Features include spectral characteristics derived from audio signals. 

This dataset is particularly useful for machine learning applications, specifically those focused on transportation and multilabel classification.
