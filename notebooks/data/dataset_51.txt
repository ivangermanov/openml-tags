Heart Disease Databases 

The Heart Disease Databases contain four datasets related to heart disease diagnosis. These datasets were collected from four different locations: the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, the V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, California, and the University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. 

Each dataset has the same instance format, although there are seventy-six raw attributes, only fourteen of these attributes are actually used. As a result, two copies of each dataset were created: one with all the attributes and another with only the fourteen attributes that were used in previous experiments.

The creators of these datasets have requested that any publications resulting from their use include the names of the principal investigators responsible for collecting the data at each institution.

Past usage of these datasets includes international applications of a new probability algorithm for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, instance-based prediction of heart disease presence, and models of incremental concept formation.

This database contains seventy-six attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of fourteen of them. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient, which is an integer value ranging from zero (no presence) to four.

Experiments with the Cleveland dataset have focused on distinguishing the presence (values one, two, three, four) from the absence (value zero) of heart disease. The names and social security numbers of the patients were removed from the database and replaced with dummy values.

There are five datasets: Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and each has a different number of instances. The Cleveland dataset has three hundred three instances, the Hungarian dataset has two hundred ninety-four instances, the Switzerland dataset has one hundred twenty-three instances, and the Long Beach VA dataset has two hundred instances.

There are seventy-six attributes in total, including the predicted attribute. However, only fourteen of these attributes are used. These fourteen attributes include age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, old peak, slope, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and the diagnosis of heart disease.

Several attributes have missing values, which are distinguished with a value of negative nine point zero.

The class distribution varies across the datasets. For example, in the Cleveland dataset, there are one hundred sixty-four instances with a value of zero, fifty-five instances with a value of one, thirty-six instances with a value of two, thirty-five instances with a value of three, and thirteen instances with a value of four.
