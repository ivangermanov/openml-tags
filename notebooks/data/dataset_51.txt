Name: Heart Disease Dataset
Tags: study_1, study_41, study_50, uci

This dataset contains information related to heart disease diagnosis collected from four locations: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, and University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. The data consists of 76 raw attributes, but only 14 are typically used in experiments.

The dataset includes information such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. The target variable indicates the presence and severity of heart disease, ranging from no presence to severe.

Multiple studies have used this dataset for various purposes, including developing probability algorithms for coronary artery disease diagnosis, instance-based prediction of heart disease presence, and conceptual clustering. The Cleveland database has been the most commonly used by machine learning researchers.

The dataset contains a total of 920 instances across the four locations, with varying class distributions. Some attributes have missing values, which are distinguished with a value of -9.0. The data has undergone some preprocessing, including the removal of patient names and social security numbers, which have been replaced with dummy values.

Researchers using this dataset are requested to cite the principal investigators responsible for data collection at each institution. The dataset has been used in several publications, achieving classification accuracies ranging from 74% to 81% using various methods such as logistic regression, instance-based prediction, and conceptual clustering.

This heart disease dataset provides valuable information for researchers and medical professionals studying cardiovascular health and developing diagnostic tools for heart disease.
