International Football Results

Tags: Demographics, Machine Learning

I found myself in need of a comprehensive and easily accessible list of international football matches, but unfortunately, I couldn't find anything satisfactory. Therefore, I decided to collect the data myself, and since I've gone through the trouble, I might as well share it.

This dataset comprises a vast collection of forty-one thousand five hundred eighty-six results of international football matches, spanning from the very first official match to the year nineteen nineteen. The matches encompass a wide range of competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, FIFI Wild Cup, and regular friendly matches. It's worth noting that the dataset only includes men's full internationals and excludes Olympic Games, as well as matches featuring national B-teams, U-23 teams, or league select teams.

The results.csv file contains the following columns:

Date, referring to the date of the match
Home Team, representing the name of the home team
Away Team, representing the name of the away team
Home Score, indicating the full-time home team score, including extra time, but excluding penalty shootouts
Away Score, indicating the full-time away team score, including extra time, but excluding penalty shootouts
Tournament, representing the name of the tournament
City, representing the name of the city, town, or administrative unit where the match was played
Country, representing the name of the country where the match was played
Neutral, a true or false column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral venue

Regarding team and country names, it's essential to note that the current name of the team has been used. For instance, when Ireland played against England in eighteen eighty-two, in this dataset, it is referred to as Northern Ireland, as the current team of Northern Ireland is the successor of the eighteen eighty-two Ireland team. This approach facilitates tracking the history and statistics of teams. Concerning country names, the name of the country at the time of the match is used. Thus, when Ghana played in Accra, Gold Coast in the nineteen fifties, although the names of the home team and the country do not match, it was a home match for Ghana, as indicated by the Neutral column, which is set to False for those matches, signifying that it was not at a neutral venue.

What trends have emerged in international football throughout the years, such as home advantage, total goals scored, and distribution of teams' strength?
Can any insights be gleaned about geopolitics from football fixtures, such as changes in the number of countries, or which teams tend to play each other frequently?
Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating?
Does hosting a major tournament significantly improve a country's chances in the tournament?
Which teams are the most active in playing friendlies and friendly tournaments, and does this strategy ultimately benefit or harm them?
