The GenBase dataset is a multi-label dataset that contains protein sequences that can be assigned to several classes of protein families. This dataset is particularly useful for multi-output classification tasks. 

The dataset features protein sequences along with their corresponding labels, which are represented by a series of protein family signatures. These signatures are essential for identifying and categorizing proteins into their respective families. 

The GenBase dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of bioinformatics and proteomics, as it provides a comprehensive collection of protein sequences and their corresponding labels.
