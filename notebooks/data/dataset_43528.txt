Swedish Central Bank Interest Rate and Inflation Dataset

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

This blended dataset contains historical Swedish interest rates and inflation rates from the early twentieth century to the beginning of the twenty-first century.

Source: The data was obtained from two reputable sources - the Swedish Central Bank (Sveriges Riksbank) and the Statistics Sweden (SCB), which is responsible for producing official statistics for Sweden.

Content: The dataset is a blend of two important economic indicators - the Swedish Central Bank's discount rate and the Swedish Consumer Price Index. The discount rate is the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, while the Consumer Price Index measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households.

Acknowledgments: The original datasets were obtained from the Swedish Central Bank and Statistics Sweden.

The Swedish Central Bank's discount rate has been used as a tool for monetary policy since the early twentieth century. The Consumer Price Index, on the other hand, is widely used as an indicator of inflation.

The dataset raises important questions about the relationship between central bank interest rates and inflation. For instance, how do changes in the central bank's discount rate affect inflation? Are there any delays in the transmission of monetary policy to inflation?

The dataset provides a unique opportunity to verify the causal relationship between interest rates and inflation using machine learning techniques. One potential approach is to use the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the coefficient of determination (R2) to analyze the relationship between interest rates and inflation.
