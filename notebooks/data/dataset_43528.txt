Swedish Central Bank Interest Rate and Inflation

This dataset is a blend of historic Swedish interest rates and inflation rates from 1908 to 2001. The source of the interest rate data is the Sveriges Riksbank, while the inflation rate data was fetched from Sweden's Statistic Central Bureau (SCB).

The content of this dataset is a blend of the Swedish historic central bank interest rate, known as diskonto, and the Swedish SCB Consumer Price Index. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between central bank interest rates and inflation.

Acknowledgments are due to the original data sets from the Swedish central bank and the Swedish SCB. The original data sets can be found at the following links: Swedish central bank interest rate diskonto and Consumer Price Index.

The inspiration behind this dataset is to investigate the effect of central bank interest rates on inflation. Specifically, it seeks to answer questions such as: How does the central bank interest rate affect inflation? What are the interest rate inflation rate delays? And, can we verify the causation between interest rates and inflation using metrics such as ROC and R2?

The dataset contains the following columns: Period, Year, Central Bank Interest Rate Diskonto Average, Inflation Rate, and Price Level.

Keywords: Swedish interest rates, inflation rates, central bank, diskonto, Consumer Price Index, interest rate inflation delay, ROC, R2, causation.
