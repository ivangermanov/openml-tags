QSAR-TID-103469 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103469. The dataset has twenty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103469. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Metastin receptor, also known as Gpr54, G-protein coupled receptor fifty-four, G-protein coupled receptor OT7T175, Kiss1r, and KiSS-1R.

The Metastin receptor is a single protein that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and neuropeptide signaling pathway. It is also involved in the regulation of cell population proliferation, cell migration, and hormone secretion.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and Reactome. It contains information on the protein target classification, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification.
