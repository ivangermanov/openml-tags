This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine, and it has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, and median pXC fifty.
