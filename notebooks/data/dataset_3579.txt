QSAR-TID-12295 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine, and it has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC Fifty.

The features represent FCFP Six One Thousand Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine. Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine is a single protein, also known as Ninety-Two Kilo Daltons Gelatinase, Ninety-Two Kilo Daltons Type Four Collagenase, Clg Four B, Gelatinase B, and Gel B. It is an enzyme, a protease, a metallo protease, and a metallo protease MAM clan, and a metallo protease M Ten A subfamily.

Matrix Metalloproteinase Nine is involved in various biological processes, including skeletal system development, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, positive regulation of leukocyte migration, proteolysis, apoptotic process, response to oxidative stress, heart development, embryo implantation, response to xenobiotic stimulus, cell migration, protein catabolic process, extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolic process, positive regulation of synaptic plasticity, cellular response to reactive oxygen species, endodermal cell differentiation, positive regulation of apoptotic process, negative regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of DNA binding, positive regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of angiogenesis, negative regulation of fibroblast proliferation, macrophage chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, response to stimulus, positive regulation of keratinocyte migration, cellular response to cadmium ion, cellular response to cell-matrix adhesion, cellular response to UV-A, positive regulation of release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, positive regulation of receptor binding, response to amyloid-beta, positive regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell proliferation, negative regulation of epithelial cell differentiation involved in kidney development, negative regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, and negative regulation of cation channel activity.
