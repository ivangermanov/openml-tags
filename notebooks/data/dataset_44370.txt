Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and a stratified boolean as arguments. It returns a dataset. The function uses a random number generator with the given seed. It then selects a subset of the data based on the given maximum number of rows, columns, and classes. If the number of classes is greater than the maximum, it selects a random subset of classes based on their frequency in the data. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and subsets the data accordingly. If the number of columns is greater than the maximum, it selects a random subset of columns. If the number of rows is greater than the maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of the data.

The dataset contains the following features: acidity, acidity, citric acid, sugar, chlorides, sulfur dioxide, sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol quality.
