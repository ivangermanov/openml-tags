KDD Cup 99 Dataset

Tags: Chemistry, Concept Drift, Life Science

This dataset is a ten percent stratified subsample of the data from the 1999 ACM KDD Cup. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.

The database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. The training and test datasets are also available in the UC Irvine KDD archive.

Intrusion Detector Learning Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.

A standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment, was provided. The data was collected over nine weeks of raw TCP dump data for a local area network simulating a typical US Air Force LAN. The LAN was operated as if it were a true Air Force environment, but peppered it with multiple attacks.

Each connection is labeled as either normal or as an attack, with exactly one specific attack type. Each connection record consists of about one hundred bytes. Attacks fall into four main categories: Denial of Service, Unauthorized Access from a Remote Machine, Unauthorized Access to Local Superuser Privileges, and Surveillance and Other Probing.

It is important to note that the test data is not from the same probability distribution as the training data, and it includes specific attack types not in the training data. This makes the task more realistic.

Derived Features

Some features were defined to help in distinguishing normal connections from attacks. There are several categories of derived features. The "same host" features examine only the connections in the past two seconds that have the same destination host as the current connection, and calculate statistics related to protocol behavior, service, etc.

The similar "same service" features examine only the connections in the past two seconds that have the same service as the current connection. "Same host" and "same service" features are together called time-based traffic features of the connection records.

Some probing attacks scan the hosts or ports using a much larger time interval than two seconds, for example once per minute. Therefore, connection records were also sorted by destination host, and features were constructed using a window of one hundred connections to the same host instead of a time window. This yields a set of so-called host-based traffic features.

Unlike most of the Denial of Service and probing attacks, there appear to be no sequential patterns that are frequent in records of Unauthorized Access from a Remote Machine and Unauthorized Access to Local Superuser Privileges attacks. This is because the Denial of Service and probing attacks involve many connections to some host(s) in a very short period of time, but the Unauthorized Access from a Remote Machine and Unauthorized Access to Local Superuser Privileges attacks are embedded in the data portions of packets, and normally involve only a single connection.

Useful algorithms for mining the unstructured data portions of packets automatically are an open research question. Domain knowledge was used to add features that look for suspicious behavior in the data portions, such as the number of failed login attempts. These features are called "content" features.
