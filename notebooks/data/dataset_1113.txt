KDDCup Dataset
Tags: concept drift

This dataset is a stratified subsample of the data from the ACM KDD Cup. It was modified by TunedIT and converted to ARFF format. The dataset was used for The International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, held in conjunction with the International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between "bad" connections (intrusions or attacks) and "good" normal connections. The database contains a standard set of data to be audited, simulating a wide variety of intrusions in a military network environment.

The intrusion detector learning task aims to build a classifier that can differentiate between malicious and normal network connections. The dataset was prepared by MIT Lincoln Labs, simulating a typical U.S. Air Force local area network (LAN) environment. The LAN was operated as if it were a genuine Air Force setting, but with multiple simulated attacks.

The raw training data consisted of compressed binary TCP dump data from seven weeks of network traffic, processed into approximately five million connection records. The test data, from two weeks of traffic, yielded around two million connection records. Each connection record represents a sequence of TCP packets between source and target IP addresses under a specific protocol, labeled as either normal or as a particular attack type.

Attacks in the dataset fall into four main categories:
- Denial of Service (DOS): attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services
- Remote to Local (R2L): unauthorized access from a remote machine
- User to Root (U2R): unauthorized access to local superuser privileges
- Probing: surveillance and network scanning activities

The test data includes specific attack types not present in the training data, making the task more realistic and challenging. The dataset contains a total of training attack types, with additional types in the test data only.

Higher-level features were derived to aid in distinguishing normal connections from attacks. These include time-based traffic features (examining connections in short time windows), host-based traffic features (examining connections to the same host over a longer period), and content features (looking for suspicious behavior in packet data).

The derived features fall into several categories:
- Basic features of individual TCP connections
- Content features within connections, based on domain knowledge
- Traffic features computed using time windows

The dataset provides a comprehensive set of features for each connection, including duration, protocol type, service, flag status, data transfer volumes, and various statistical measures of network behavior.
