GEMLeR provides a collection of gene expression datasets that can be utilized for benchmarking gene expression-oriented machine learning algorithms. These datasets can be employed for estimating different quality metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among others, for classification, feature selection, or clustering algorithms.

The inspiration behind creating this repository arose from an increasing need within the machine learning and bioinformatics communities for a comprehensive collection of microarray classification problems that could be shared among researchers. This allows for the comparison of diverse classification or feature selection techniques on the same set of problems.

Each gene expression sample in the GEMLeR repository originates from the large, publicly available Expression Project for Oncology repository by the International Genomics Consortium. The primary objective of the Expression Project for Oncology and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standardized conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of de-identified tumor samples. The tumor data is subsequently updated with clinical outcomes and released into the public domain without any intellectual property restrictions.

The availability of this information translates into direct benefits for patients, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies alike. Although various other sources of gene expression data are available, the decision to utilize data from the Expression Project for Oncology repository was made due to the consistency of tissue sample processing procedures, the same microarray platform being used for all samples, the availability of additional information for combined genotype-phenotype studies, and the availability of a large number of samples for different tumor types.
