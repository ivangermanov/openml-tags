Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted.

This dataset focuses on the effects of arsenic exposure on male lung health. It has been processed to create a binary classification, dividing cases into positive and negative outcomes based on a calculated mean threshold. The original numeric data was transformed to facilitate easier analysis and comparison between groups. This binarization allows for clearer distinctions in study results and may aid in identifying risk factors or trends related to arsenic exposure in males.

The dataset includes information on various factors that could influence lung health outcomes, such as concentration levels, age of subjects, and risk factors. These features provide a comprehensive view of the potential impacts of arsenic on respiratory health in men. Researchers and data scientists can utilize this modified dataset to explore correlations and patterns that may not have been as apparent in the original numeric format.

By converting the data into a binary classification, the dataset becomes more accessible for certain types of statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms. This transformation may prove particularly useful for studies aimed at predicting outcomes or identifying key variables that contribute to positive or negative lung health results in the context of arsenic exposure.
