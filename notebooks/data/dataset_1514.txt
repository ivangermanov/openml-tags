MetaQSAR Project Dataset: QSAR-TID-12587
Tags: Machine Learning, Medicine, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12587. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024-bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the ChEMBL version seventeen database. It is essential for machine learning models in medicine, particularly in the development of QSAR models for predicting the biological activities of molecules.

The molecular fingerprints were generated without requiring missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. This dataset is crucial for researchers working on machine learning models for predicting the biological activities of molecules.

The features included in this dataset are Molecule ChEMBL ID and multiple FCFP6 1024-bit molecular fingerprint features. These features are essential for developing accurate QSAR models.

The target protein is Cathepsin L2, also known as Cathepsin L2, Cathepsin U, Cathepsin V, CATL2, and CTSL2. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified under the enzyme/protease/cysteine protease/cysteine protease CA clan/cysteine protease C1A family category.

Cathepsin L2 is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis, apoptotic process, immune response, positive regulation of peptidase activity, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II, extracellular matrix disassembly, and proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process.
