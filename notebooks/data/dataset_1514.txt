Data Set Information:
This MALDI-TOF dataset consists of two main components:

A) A reference panel of twenty Gram-positive and negative bacterial species covering nine genera, among which several species are known to be difficult to discriminate by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Each species was represented by eleven to sixty mass spectra obtained from seven to twenty bacterial strains, constituting a dataset of spectra obtained from strains. The spectra were acquired according to the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routine, where the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before a portion of the colony was picked, spotted on a MALDI slide, and a mass spectrum was acquired.

B) Based on this reference panel, a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was created. For this purpose, ten pairs of species with varying taxonomic proximity were considered:

- Four mixtures, labeled A, B, C, and D, involved species belonging to the same genus.
- Two mixtures, labeled E and F, involved species belonging to distinct genera but the same Gram type.
- Four mixtures, labeled G, H, I, and J, involved species belonging to distinct Gram types.

Each mixture was represented by two pairs of strains, which were mixed according to nine concentration ratios: pure samples of each species and various proportions of mixtures. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each pair of strains, resulting in a dataset of spectra, among which are pure sample spectra.
