Churn for Bank Customers

The dataset contains various features that can help identify the factors contributing to customer churn in a bank. The Row Number corresponds to the record number and has no effect on the output. The Customer ID contains random values and has no impact on a customer's decision to leave the bank. A customer's surname also has no bearing on their decision to exit the bank.

On the other hand, a customer's credit score can have a significant effect on their likelihood of leaving the bank, as those with higher credit scores are less likely to churn. A customer's geographical location can also play a role in their decision to leave the bank. Furthermore, it is interesting to explore whether a customer's gender has any influence on their decision to exit the bank.

A customer's age is certainly a relevant factor, as older customers are generally less likely to leave their bank than younger ones. The tenure of a customer, referring to the number of years they have been a client of the bank, is also an important factor, as longer-tenured customers tend to be more loyal and less likely to leave. The balance in a customer's account is also a strong indicator of their likelihood of churning, as those with higher balances are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.

The number of products a customer has purchased through the bank is another relevant feature, as customers with multiple products are less likely to leave. Having a credit card is also a significant factor, as customers with credit cards tend to be more loyal to their bank. Additionally, active customers are less likely to leave the bank, and their estimated salary can also influence their decision to exit, with those on lower salaries being more likely to churn.

The ultimate goal of this dataset is to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn, as it is much more expensive to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. By understanding what drives customers to leave, banks can develop targeted loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.
