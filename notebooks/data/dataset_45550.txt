The Atlas Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge Dataset 

This dataset originates from the Kaggle Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge held in the year two thousand fourteen. The data was downloaded from the CERN Open Data Portal, which also provides detailed documentation for the data. For further information regarding this challenge, one may visit the Kaggle webpage, the challenge website, and the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research competition proceedings.

Please note that this specific version replaces all instances of minus nine ninety-nine with Not a Number (NaN).

This dataset consists of various features including event identification, mass measurements, particle transverse momentum, particle delta eta values, particle mass ratios, and other kinematic properties of subatomic particles. Additionally, the dataset contains weight and label information for each event, along with a designation indicating whether an event belongs to the training or testing set.
