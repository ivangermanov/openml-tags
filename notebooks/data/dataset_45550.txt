This is the dataset from the Atlas Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge. The data was downloaded from the Cern website, which also hosts the documentation of the data. Further information about the challenge can be found on Kaggle, the challenge website, and the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research competition proceedings.

The dataset contains a collection of features that describe particle collisions, including the mass, transverse momentum, and angular distributions of the particles involved. These features are used to train machine learning models to distinguish between signal and background events in the search for the Higgs Boson.

The dataset includes a weight column that represents the relative importance of each event, as well as a label column that indicates whether the event is a signal or background event. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the machine learning models and the testing set used to evaluate their performance.

The dataset also includes a column indicating which events were used in the Kaggle competition, as well as a weight column specific to the Kaggle competition.
