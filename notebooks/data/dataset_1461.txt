Bank Marketing

This dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were conducted via phone calls. Often, multiple contacts with the same client were necessary to determine if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not. The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

Attribute Information:

Bank client data:
- Age (numeric)
- Job: type of job (categorical: administrative, unknown, unemployed, management, housemaid, entrepreneur, student, blue collar, self employed, retired, technician, services)
- Marital status (categorical: married, divorced, single; note: "divorced" includes divorced and widowed)
- Education (categorical: unknown, secondary, primary, tertiary)
- Default: has credit in default? (binary: yes, no)
- Balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric)
- Housing: has housing loan? (binary: yes, no)
- Loan: has personal loan? (binary: yes, no)

Related to the last contact of the current campaign:
- Contact: contact communication type (categorical: unknown, telephone, cellular)
- Day: last contact day of the month (numeric)
- Month: last contact month of year (categorical: Jan, Feb, Mar, ..., Nov, Dec)
- Duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)

Other attributes:
- Campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
- Pdays: number of days that passed after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)
- Previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
- Poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: unknown, other, failure, success)

Output variable (desired target):
- Y: has the client subscribed to a term deposit? (binary: yes, no)

Additional Information:
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required to determine if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not. There are four datasets available, varying in size and number of input variables. The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit. This dataset does not contain missing values.
