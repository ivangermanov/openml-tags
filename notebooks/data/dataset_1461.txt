The Bank Marketing dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. These marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess whether the product, namely a bank term deposit, would be subscribed or not.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. This dataset contains seventeen input variables and one output variable. The input variables include bank client data, such as age, job, marital status, education, and whether they have credit in default. It also includes information related to the last contact of the current campaign, including the contact communication type, day, and month of the last contact, as well as the duration of the last contact. Additionally, there are other attributes, including the number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client, the number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign, the number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client, and the outcome of the previous marketing campaign.

The output variable is whether the client has subscribed a term deposit. This dataset does not contain any missing values.

There are four versions of this dataset, including bank-additional-full with all examples and twenty inputs, bank-additional with ten percent of the examples and twenty inputs, bank-full with all examples and seventeen inputs, and bank with ten percent of the examples and seventeen inputs. The smaller datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms.
