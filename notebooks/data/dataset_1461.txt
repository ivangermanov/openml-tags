**Tags:** Machine Learning, MTLQSAR, Study Three, Transportation
**Dataset:** MetaQSAR Project - September 2015
**Citation:** This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12366.

The dataset has one hundred sixty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent Fingerprint Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is related to the Hepatitis C Virus Polyprotein, specifically the genotype one a isolate one. The protein target classification is described as a single protein. The description relationship accession genome polyprotein is also classified as a single protein.

The scraped data includes information about the protein target, such as its preferred name, synonyms, organism, species group, and protein target classification. Additionally, there is information about the gene ontology, including biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions.

The gene ontology biological processes include virus-host interaction, suppression of host innate immune response, and disruption of host antiviral defense response. The cellular components include host cell plasma membrane, host cell cytoplasm, and virion component. The molecular functions include nucleotide binding, RNA binding, and ATP binding.

Furthermore, the dataset includes information about the protein-protein interactions, including interaction with host cell proteins and other viral proteins. There is also information about the protein structure, including its domains and motifs.
