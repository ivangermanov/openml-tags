Energy Efficiency Dataset 
Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning 

The dataset was created to perform energy analysis using twelve different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. These buildings vary in terms of their glazing area, glazing area distribution, and orientation, among other parameters. By simulating various settings based on these characteristics, we were able to obtain seven hundred sixty-eight building shapes. The dataset consists of seven hundred sixty-eight samples and eight features, with the goal of predicting two real-valued responses. Additionally, this dataset can be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

Attribute Information:
This dataset contains eight attributes, or features, which are used to predict two responses, or outcomes. The aim is to utilize these eight features to predict each of the two responses. Specifically, the features include relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. These features are used to predict heating load and cooling load.
