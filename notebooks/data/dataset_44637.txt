Segment Seed Four with Two Thousand Rows, One Hundred Columns, and Ten Classes, Stratified

This dataset is a subsample of the original segment dataset, generated with a seed of four. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset to a manageable size. The resulting dataset has two thousand rows, one hundred columns, and ten classes.

The subsampling process began by selecting classes from the original dataset. Since there were more than ten classes, a random sample of ten classes was chosen, with the probability of selection proportional to the frequency of each class. The indices where these classes were present were then selected, and the corresponding rows were retained.

Next, the columns were uniformly sampled. Since there were more than one hundred columns, a random sample of one hundred columns was chosen. The selected columns were then retained, and the others were discarded.

Finally, the rows were sampled to reduce the dataset to two thousand rows. Since stratification was required, the dataset was split using a stratified sampling approach, ensuring that the class distribution was preserved.

The resulting dataset has ten classes, one hundred columns, and two thousand rows. The features include various measures of line density, vegetation edge density, hedge density, intensity, and color properties.
