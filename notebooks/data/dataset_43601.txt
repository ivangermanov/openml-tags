Daily Wheat Price

Context
Last time I built a Long Short Term Memory price prediction for Corn, but the result was not satisfactory. I would like to try other algorithms and data. So I decided to use Wheat price for the exercise. And this time the data is more extensive in terms of time duration.

Content
The daily Wheat dataset is from October to March. It is downloaded from Investing.com or Quantapi, which also have an API for it.

Acknowledgements
Investing.com and Quantapi are acknowledged for providing the dataset.

Inspiration
To the extent that you can find ways where you are making predictions, there is no substitute for testing yourself on real-world situations that you do not know the answer to in advance.

Features
