Daily Wheat Price

Tags: Computer Systems, Machine Learning

Last time, I attempted to build a Long Short-Term Memory price prediction model for corn, but unfortunately, the results were not satisfactory. Therefore, I have decided to explore alternative algorithms and datasets. This time, I will be working with wheat prices, which provide a more extensive timeframe of nine years.

The daily wheat dataset spans from October fourteen two thousand and nine to March twelve two thousand and eighteen. This dataset was obtained from Investing.com or alternatively, it can be accessed through Quantapi's Application Programming Interface.
