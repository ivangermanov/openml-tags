QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID. It has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Beta chymotrypsin, also known as Chymotrypsin B chain A, B, and C, as well as Chymotrypsinogen B. This protein target is classified as an Enzyme/Protease/Serine protease/Serine protease PA clan/Serine protease SA subfamily. It is found in Bos taurus (cattle) and is associated with the extracellular region and extracellular space.

Beta chymotrypsin has several important functions, including serine type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. It is involved in biological processes such as proteolysis and digestion. The protein is linked to various database entries, including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.

The InterPro entries associated with this protein include Trypsin domain, Peptidase SA, Peptidase S PA, Trypsin histidine, Trypsin serine, and Peptidase S PA chymotrypsin. The Pfam entry is Trypsin, and there are multiple PDBe entries associated with this protein.
