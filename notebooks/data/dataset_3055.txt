QSAR-TID-17035 Dataset: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17035. The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Folded Chemical Fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 17035.

Beta-Chymotrypsin is a single protein preferred name with synonyms Chymotrypsin B chain A, Chymotrypsin B chain B, and Chymotrypsin B chain C. Its species group is Bos taurus, and its protein target classification is enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily.

It has component relationships with extracellular region and extracellular space, and function relationships with serine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, and hydrolase activity. Its biological process relationships include proteolysis and digestion.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, beta-chymotrypsin, serine protease, peptidase activity, proteolysis.
