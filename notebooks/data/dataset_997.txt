Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

Features: Left weight, Left distance, Right weight, Right distance, Binary class

This dataset, known as Balance Scale, is a modified version of an original multi-class dataset. It has been transformed into a binary classification problem by converting the target feature into two classes. The majority class is labeled as positive, while all other classes are grouped together as negative. This binarization process allows for simplified analysis and modeling of the data.

The dataset contains several features related to a balance scale, including weights and distances for both the left and right sides. These measurements are used to determine the balance state, which has been simplified into a binary outcome. This transformation makes the dataset suitable for various machine learning algorithms and statistical analyses focused on binary classification tasks.

The original source and creation date of this dataset are unknown, highlighting the importance of proper data provenance and documentation in research. Users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately in their work, acknowledging both the original dataset and the binarization process.
