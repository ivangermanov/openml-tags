QSAR-TID-12968 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12968. The dataset has 668 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in the Orexin receptor 2 target.

Orexin receptor 2 is a protein target that belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor and is involved in various physiological processes, including feeding behavior, circadian sleep/wake cycle, and locomotion. It is also known as Hypocretin receptor type 2 or Ox2R.

The dataset contains information on several compounds that have been tested for their activity on the Orexin receptor 2 target, including their Molecule ChEMBL ID, Median PXc50 values, and FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints.
