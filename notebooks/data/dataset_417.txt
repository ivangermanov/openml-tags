This dataset is one of several drug design datasets. The datasets with features are formed using Adriana.Code software. The molecules and outputs are taken from original studies. The last attribute in each file is the target.

The datasets cover various aspects of drug design and molecular modeling, including melting point prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), and biodegradability prediction. They encompass a wide range of chemical compounds such as carbolenes, benzodiazepines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and protein kinase inhibitors.

The datasets are derived from numerous published studies in medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and toxicology. These studies explore topics such as molecular diversity, ligand binding to receptors, and the development of predictive models for various physicochemical properties and biological activities.

Some datasets focus on specific chemical classes or biological targets, while others cover broader ranges of compounds and properties. The data has been used to develop and validate various computational models and methods in drug discovery and chemical informatics.

The features in these datasets represent molecular descriptors calculated using specialized software. These descriptors capture various aspects of molecular structure and properties, which are used to build predictive models for drug-like properties, toxicity, and biological activity.

Overall, this collection of datasets serves as a valuable resource for researchers in the fields of cheminformatics, computational chemistry, and drug discovery, providing a diverse set of data for developing and testing new methods in molecular modeling and property prediction.
