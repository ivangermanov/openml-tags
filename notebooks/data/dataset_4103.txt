QSAR-TID-100948 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100948. The dataset has rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used in QSAR modeling. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against the drug target TID: 100948, which is a proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER.

Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER is a single protein target that is involved in various biological processes, including natural killer cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, and protein phosphorylation. It is also associated with several diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa thirty-eight.
