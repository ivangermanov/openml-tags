APS Failure Seed Three Dataset 

This dataset is a subsample of the APS Failure dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involves uniform sampling of classes, columns, and rows to reduce the dataset size while maintaining its representativeness.

The dataset has been generated with a seed value of three, which ensures reproducibility of the results. The maximum number of rows has been set to two thousand, and the maximum number of columns has been limited to one hundred. Furthermore, the number of classes has been capped at ten. 

To ensure that the sampling is stratified, the dataset has been split into subsets based on the class distribution. This approach helps maintain the proportion of each class in the subsampled dataset, which is essential for machine learning model training and evaluation.

The feature set includes various attributes, such as acceleration, angular velocity, and other sensor readings. These features have been carefully selected to provide a comprehensive representation of the underlying system.
