QSAR-TID-100126 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100126. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 747 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein, Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase B-Raf, is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is a member of the Raf kinase family and plays a crucial role in the MAPK signaling pathway.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for the prediction of B-Raf inhibitors, which can be used for the development of new cancer therapies.
