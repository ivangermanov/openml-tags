This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Single Protein Preferred Name: Serine Threonine Protein Kinase B Raf.

Features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset has seven hundred forty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX fifty.
