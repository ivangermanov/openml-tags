This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: two hundred sixty-two, and it has four hundred twenty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from smiles strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, dassault syst√®mes biovia. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project from September two thousand fifteen.
