Urban Trees Features:

The Urban Tree Dataset consists of various attributes describing the characteristics of urban trees.

The dataset includes information about the tree's location, such as its ID, commune, neighborhood, site, and street side.

It also features details about the tree itself, including its genus, species, control measures, soil type, permeable surface area, planting date, age class, height, diameter, circumference, and vitality.

Furthermore, the dataset provides information on the tree's health, including the presence of fungi, insects, wounds, and other observations on the trunk, branches, and roots.

Additionally, the dataset contains data on the tree's maintenance expectations, constraints, diagnostic classifications, and prescribed treatments.

Finally, the dataset includes spatial references, such as longitude and latitude coordinates, and photo references.
