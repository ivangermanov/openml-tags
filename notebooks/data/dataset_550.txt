Smoothmeth

A collection of the data sets used in the book "Smoothing Methods in Statistics," published by Springer Verlag, New York. This submission consists of numerous files, plus this README file. Each file represents a data set analyzed in the book. The names of the files correspond to the names given in the book. The data files are written in plain ASCII (character) text. Missing values are represented by "M" in all data files.

Several of the files include an alphabetic (labeling) variable. It is likely that these files would have to be input into a package using fixed, rather than free, format. The relevant files, along with appropriate Fortran format statements, are listed in detail.

Description of data sources and further information about the data sets can be found in the "Descriptions of the data sets" section of the book. A World Wide Web browser can be used to access a site devoted to the book.

These datasets may be used freely for scientific, educational and/or non commercial purposes, provided suitable acknowledgment is given (by citing the reference above).
