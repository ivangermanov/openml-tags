KDDCup Full Dataset

This dataset was used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, held in conjunction with KDD, The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between "bad" connections, called intrusions or attacks, and "good" normal connections.

The database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. The training and test datasets are also available in the UC Irvine KDD archive.

The intrusion detector learning task aims to build a predictive model (classifier) capable of distinguishing between intrusions or attacks and normal connections. The DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program, prepared and managed by MIT Lincoln Labs, provided a standard set of data including various intrusions simulated in a military network environment.

Lincoln Labs set up an environment to acquire nine weeks of raw TCP dump data for a local area network simulating a typical U.S. Air Force LAN. They operated the LAN as if it were a true Air Force environment, but included multiple attacks. The raw training data was processed into about five million connection records, while the two weeks of test data yielded around two million connection records.

A connection is defined as a sequence of TCP packets starting and ending at well defined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP address to a target IP address under a specific protocol. Each connection is labeled as either normal or as an attack, with a specific attack type. Connection records consist of about bytes.

Attacks fall into four main categories:
- Denial of service (DOS), such as syn flood
- Unauthorized access from a remote machine (R2L), such as guessing passwords
- Unauthorized access to local superuser privileges (U2R), such as buffer overflow attacks
- Surveillance and probing, such as port scanning

The test data is not from the same probability distribution as the training data and includes specific attack types not present in the training data, making the task more realistic. Some intrusion experts believe that most novel attacks are variants of known attacks, and the "signature" of known attacks can be sufficient to catch novel variants.

Higher level features were defined to help distinguish normal connections from attacks. These include time based traffic features examining connections in the past two seconds with the same destination host or service, and host based traffic features constructed using a window of connections to the same host. Content features were also added to look for suspicious behavior in the data portions of packets.

The dataset includes basic features of individual TCP connections, content features within connections suggested by domain knowledge, and traffic features computed using time windows. These features cover various aspects of network connections and potential intrusion patterns.
