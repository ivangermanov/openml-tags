QSAR-TID-10262 Tags: Economics, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10262. The dataset has six hundred thirty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited as such.

The dataset shows activity values of several compounds on drug target Casein Kinase One Gamma One, also known as Single Protein. It is a subset of Casein Kinase One Protein Family.

Casein Kinase One Gamma One is an enzyme that belongs to the protein kinase group and CK one protein kinase family. It is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, endocytosis, signal transduction, Wnt signaling pathway, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, and positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.
