QSAR-TID-10262 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10262. The dataset has a total of six hundred thirty-nine rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10262. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. This dataset is specifically focused on the Casein Kinase I Gamma one protein, which is a single protein target.

The Casein Kinase I Gamma one protein is a member of the CK one protein kinase family and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, and Wnt signaling pathway. It is also known to be involved in the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

The dataset is scraped from various sources, including ChEMBL, Expression Atlas, Go Component, Go Function, Go Process, canSAR-Target, GuideToPHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Tchem, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe.
