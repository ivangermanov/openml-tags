Digital Currency Time Series

Howdy folks! I have prepared a starter dataset for time series practice. This is my first upload, and I am excited to share it with the community. Any questions or feedback are welcome, as I am eager to learn and improve.

The data was prepared using the Alpha Vantage Application Programming Interface. The data represents historical daily time series for a digital currency, specifically Bitcoin, traded on the Saudi market in Saudi Riyal. Additionally, prices and volumes are quoted in both Saudi Riyal and United States Dollar. The data date range spans from May eleventh to January thirtieth.

Task: Use the past to predict the future! Check the Tasks tab for more information.

Acknowledgements: Special thanks to all the instructors and friends who have supported me throughout this journey.

Features: Open in Saudi Riyal, Open in United States Dollar, High in Saudi Riyal, High in United States Dollar, Low in Saudi Riyal, Low in United States Dollar, Close in Saudi Riyal, Close in United States Dollar, and Volume.
