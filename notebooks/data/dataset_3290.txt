QSAR-TID-20126 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin 2 receptor, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Neurokinin 2 receptor. The Neurokinin 2 receptor is a single protein, also known as Neurokinin A receptor, NK-2R, NK-2 receptor, SKR, and Substance-K receptor. It belongs to the species group Oryctolagus cuniculus and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

The dataset has multiple features, including Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints. The FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Neurokinin 2 receptor is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, tachykinin receptor signaling pathway, regulation of uterine smooth muscle contraction, and positive regulation of flagellated sperm motility. It is also associated with various cellular components, including plasma membrane, membrane, sperm flagellum, sperm head, and sperm midpiece.
