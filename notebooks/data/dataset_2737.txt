This dataset contains the historical price data of the Forex USD/DKK exchange rate from Dukascopy. Each row represents a single hourly candlestick, covering a period from January first to December thirteenth. Since the Forex market is not active on weekends, these days are excluded from the dataset.

The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam time zone. The class attribute represents the direction of the mean high price of the following hour relative to the current hour. Specifically, if the mean high price is expected to increase in the next hour, the class attribute is labeled as true; otherwise, it is false if the price remains stagnant or decreases.

Please note that this dataset is intended for scientific purposes only and should not be used for actual trading strategies, which require predictions based on close attributes.
