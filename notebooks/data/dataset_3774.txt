QSAR-TID-11947 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11947. The dataset has seventeen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha. Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha is a single protein, also known as Rara, and is a transcription factor and nuclear receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including transcription regulation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis.

Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A. It is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The receptor is also involved in the regulation of embryonic development and cell fate determination.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to study the structure-activity relationships of compounds on Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha and to identify potential lead compounds for drug discovery.
