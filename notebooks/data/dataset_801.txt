This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by re-labeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset originally featured multiple classes, but these have been condensed into two categories for simplicity and ease of analysis. This conversion allows researchers to more easily identify trends and patterns within the data.

The dataset includes various features related to Broadway shows, including the type of show, whether it was a revival, ratings from the New York Times and Daily News, attendance figures for the first week, and any awards received.
