Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset, known as CHSCase Funds, is a modified version of an original dataset from an unknown source. The primary modification involves binarizing the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a two-class nominal feature. This conversion is achieved by calculating the mean of the target values across all instances. Subsequently, instances with target values below this mean are classified as positive ('P'), while those at or above the mean are classified as negative ('N').

The dataset is associated with various study-related tags, suggesting its potential use in research or educational contexts. It may be particularly relevant for mythbusting exercises or comparative studies. The binarization process simplifies the original data, potentially making it more suitable for certain types of analysis or machine learning tasks that require binary classification.

Users of this dataset are encouraged to cite it appropriately, acknowledging its derivation from the original source and the binarization process applied. The features included in the dataset provide various data points for analysis, though their specific nature is not detailed in the provided information.
