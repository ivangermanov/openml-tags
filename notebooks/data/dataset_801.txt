The Chscase Funds Dataset 

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, Mythbusting, Study 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by computing the mean and then classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

Features include columns one, two, and three, along with a Binary Class feature.
