Yu Gi Oh is a Japanese manga series about gaming. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The plot follows the story of a boy who solves the ancient Millennium Puzzle. He awakens a gambling alter ego within his body that solves his conflicts using various games.

Two anime adaptations were produced. One adaptation was produced by Toei Animation, and another adaptation was produced by NAS and animated by Studio Gallop, titled Yu Gi Oh Duel Monsters. The manga series has spawned a media franchise that includes multiple spin off manga and anime series, a trading card game, and numerous video games. 

Most of the incarnations of the franchise involve the fictional trading card game known as Duel Monsters, where each player uses cards to duel each other in a mock battle of fantasy monsters. This forms the basis for the real life Yu Gi Oh Trading Card Game. 

As of recent years, Yu Gi Oh is one of the highest grossing media franchises of all time.
