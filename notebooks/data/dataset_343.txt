White Clover Persistence Trials
Tags: study, study

Data source: AgResearch, Whatawhata Research Centre, Hamilton, New Zealand

The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms influencing the persistence of white clover populations in summer-dry hill land. Particular focus was given to the consequences of a severe summer drought period in 1993/1994 and its impact on the performance of three white clover cultivars in an ongoing experiment located at Whatawhata Research Centre.

The machine learning objective was to predict the amount of white clover in 1994 based on the quantities of white clover and other species measured from 1991 to 1994, as well as information on the 'strata' where the white clover was being grown.

Attribute Information:
- Strata (enumerated)
- Plot (enumerated)
- Paddock (enumerated)
- White Clover measurements (real values for years 1991-1994)
- Bare Ground measurements (real values for years 1991-1994)
- Cocksfoot measurements (real values for years 1991-1994)
- Other Grasses measurements (real values for years 1991-1994)
- Other Legumes measurements (real values for years 1991-1994)
- Rye Grass measurements (real values for years 1991-1994)
- Weeds measurements (real values for years 1991-1994)
- Strata combined (enumerated)

The dataset includes measurements for various plant species and ground cover types over a four-year period, allowing for analysis of changes in vegetation composition and white clover persistence. The severe drought in 1993/1994 provides an opportunity to study the impact of extreme weather conditions on plant populations in hill country pastures.

This comprehensive dataset enables researchers to investigate factors affecting white clover persistence and potentially develop predictive models for white clover performance in challenging environmental conditions. The inclusion of multiple plant species and ground cover measurements allows for a holistic analysis of pasture composition and its influence on white clover survival and growth.
