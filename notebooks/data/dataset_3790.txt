QSAR-TID-17080 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Angiotensin II type 1a receptor, and it has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin II type 1a receptor. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The Angiotensin II type 1a receptor is a single protein, also known as AGTR1, Angiotensin II type-1 receptor, AT1 receptor, and Type-1 angiotensin II receptor. It is a membrane receptor, belonging to the Family A G protein-coupled receptor, Peptide receptor family, and Short peptide receptor family.

The receptor is involved in various biological processes, including maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis by renin-angiotensin, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, regulation of vasoconstriction, angiotensin-activated signaling pathway, and phospholipase C-activating angiotensin-activated signaling pathway.
