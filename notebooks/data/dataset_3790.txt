This dataset contains Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin II Receptor, also known as Angiotensin II Type One A Receptor or AT-One A Receptor.

The dataset has been obtained from the MetaQSAR project and consists of one thousand one hundred thirty-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including molecule identifiers and class features. The features represent molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The features include molecule identifiers, molecular fingerprints, and class features.

The dataset is related to social media and transportation studies.
