The Texas Winter Storm 2021 Tweets dataset is a collection of tweets posted during the devastating Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, which brought widespread chaos to the United States, particularly in Texas, causing massive power outages, water and food shortages, and treacherous weather conditions.

This dataset comprises tweets from influential users, primarily those with over five thousand followers, although it also includes a smaller subset of tweets from other users. The tweets provide valuable insights into the public sentiment and perception of the crisis management efforts during this critical period.

The dataset can be leveraged to apply Natural Language Processing techniques, enabling researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the user sentiments and opinions expressed on Twitter regarding the handling of the crisis.

Some key attributes of the dataset include tweet identifiers, usernames, tweet texts, hashtags used, creation timestamps, follower counts, friend counts, favorite counts, expanded URLs, user descriptions, user creation timestamps, user locations, tweet sources, and mentions of other users.
