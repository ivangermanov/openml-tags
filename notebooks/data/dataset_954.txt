This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative.

Features:

* Light Reception System Name
* Identification Type
* Right Ascension
* Declination
* Scale Factor

The dataset also includes various flux measurements for both blue and red bands.

The blue band flux measurements range from one to forty-four, providing a comprehensive spectrum analysis.

Similarly, the red band flux measurements range from one to forty-seven, offering an extensive range of spectral data.
