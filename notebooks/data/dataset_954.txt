Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual.

Features: LRS name, ID type, Right Ascension, Declination, Scale Factor, Blue base, Red base, blue band flux, red band flux

This dataset contains spectroscopic measurements of celestial objects. It includes various features related to the objects' positions, scaling factors, and flux measurements in both blue and red spectral bands. The data has been processed to create a binary classification problem, with objects labeled as either positive or negative based on their spectral characteristics.

The original multi-class dataset was transformed into a binary classification task to simplify analysis and potentially improve machine learning model performance. This binarization process involved identifying the majority class and labeling it as positive, while all other classes were combined and labeled as negative.

The features in this dataset provide a comprehensive spectral profile of each observed object, allowing for detailed analysis of their properties and classification. The inclusion of both blue and red spectral bands offers insight into different aspects of the objects' emission or absorption characteristics across the electromagnetic spectrum.

This dataset may be valuable for researchers and data scientists working in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and machine learning, particularly those interested in spectral analysis and classification of celestial objects.
