CPMP 2015 Runtime Classification

This dataset is an extension of the 2013 pre-marshalling dataset, featuring a more comprehensive set of features and a collection of test instances. The dataset includes three distinct sets of features: the full set of features derived from the second iteration of our latent feature analysis process, a reduced set of features obtained after the first iteration, and the original features used in the 2013 pre-marshalling dataset.

The features for the pre-marshalling problem are remarkably easy and fast to compute, which is why the feature costs file has been omitted, as it would indicate a computation time of zero for every feature, regardless of the feature set used.

The dataset provides test data with an identical naming scheme, and the feature computation code is available online. Note that the scenario was previously referred to as Pre-Marshalling-AStar 2015, but has been renamed to conserve space.

The features included in this dataset are stacks, tiers, stack to tier ratio, container density, percentage of empty stacks, percentage of overstowing stacks, percentage of stacks with two containers overstowing, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of groups with the same characteristics, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of top good containers, percentage of overstowage, and bottom floor left behind.
