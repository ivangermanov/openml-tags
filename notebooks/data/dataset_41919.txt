The CPMP 2015 Runtime Classification dataset is an extension of the 2013 Premarshalling dataset, featuring more characteristics and a set of test instances. This dataset comprises three sets of characteristics: one containing the full set of characteristics from the second iteration of the Latent Feature Analysis process; another containing only the characteristics after the first iteration; and a third containing the characteristics used in the Premarshalling Astar 2013 dataset.

Each set of characteristics has a corresponding test data file, following an identical naming convention. Notably, the characteristics for the Premarshalling Problem are extremely easy and fast to compute, so the feature costs file has been omitted.

The dataset provides a comprehensive set of characteristics, including the number of stacks, tiers, stack-to-tier ratio, container density, percentage of empty stacks, percentage of overstowed stacks, percentage of overstowed stacks with two containers, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of groups with the same characteristics, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of good containers on top, percentage of overstowage, bottom floor left behind, left density, tier-weighted groups, average L1 top-left large group, containers empty greater than estimated stack, and percentage of bottom containers on top.
