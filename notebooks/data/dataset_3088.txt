According to research, eighty percent of customers are more likely to do business with a company if it provides personalized service. Banking is no exception. The digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner, often before they have even realized they need the service.

In its third Kaggle competition, the Santander Group aims to go a step beyond recognizing that there is a need to provide a customer a financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, yet simple and personal way.

With so many choices for financial services available, this need is greater now than ever before. In this competition, the Santander Group is asking Kagglers to help them identify the value of transactions for each potential customer. This is a first step that the Santander Group needs to accomplish in order to personalize its services at scale.

You are provided with an anonymized dataset containing numeric feature variables, the numeric target column, and a string identification column. The task is to predict the value of the target column.
