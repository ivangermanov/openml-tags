QSAR-TID-11451 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11451. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings.

The dataset was obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprint features, and many more.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various biological targets.

The target protein, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor, also known as MET, is a single-pass type one transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell survival, migration, and proliferation. It is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including the PI three kinase AKT signaling pathway, the RAS signaling pathway, and the STAT three signaling pathway.

The receptor is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where it promotes tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, inhibiting its activity has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.
