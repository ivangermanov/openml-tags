QSAR-TID-11451 Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI50) of several compounds on drug target TID:, and it has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC50). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP, and many more...

The dataset includes information on the Hepatocyte growth factor receptor, also known as HGF receptor, HGF/SF receptor, MET, and Proto-oncogene c-Met. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Met family classification.

The Hepatocyte growth factor receptor is involved in various biological processes, including endothelial cell morphogenesis, liver development, protein phosphorylation, phagocytosis, signal transduction, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, nervous system development, and regulation of autophagy. It also plays roles in cell migration, neuron differentiation, pancreas development, and the regulation of microtubule polymerization.

This receptor has multiple molecular functions, such as nucleotide binding, protein kinase activity, protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, hepatocyte growth factor receptor activity, protein binding, ATP binding, and semaphorin receptor activity.

The Hepatocyte growth factor receptor is associated with several cellular components, including the extracellular region, plasma membrane, basal plasma membrane, cell surface, and receptor complex.

Various inhibitors targeting the Hepatocyte growth factor receptor have been developed and studied, including AMG, BMS, Crizotinib, and BPI. These compounds are at different phases of development and have varying mechanisms of action.

The dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying drug-target interactions, molecular fingerprints, and quantitative structure-activity relationships in the context of the Hepatocyte growth factor receptor.
