Machine Learning and Mathematics Subsampling of the Christine dataset with Seed equals One 
Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in parameters including seed, number of rows maximum, number of columns maximum, number of classes maximum, and whether to stratify or not. It returns a new dataset.

This function first gets the unique classes from the target variable y. If there are more classes than the specified maximum, it selects a random sample of classes based on their frequency.

Then, it selects the indices where one of these classes is present and filters the data accordingly. 

Next, it checks if the number of columns exceeds the specified maximum. If so, it randomly selects a subset of columns.

If the number of rows still exceeds the specified maximum, it uses stratified sampling to select a subset of rows.

Finally, it returns a new dataset with the filtered data, along with the categorical mask and column names.

Features: 
this dataset contains a wide range of variables including demographic, financial, and behavioral characteristics
