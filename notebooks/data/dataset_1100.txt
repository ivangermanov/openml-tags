This dataset illustrates the use of basic statistical methods and has been converted to ARFF format.

The dataset consists of data collected from students in grades four through six from three school districts in Ingham and Clinton Counties, Michigan. The researchers strategically selected students from urban, suburban, and rural school districts to ensure a diverse representation, with approximately one third of the sample coming from each district.

Students were asked to indicate which goal was most important to them: making good grades, being athletically able, or being popular. Additionally, they ranked four factors – grades, sports, physical appearance, and wealth – in order of their perceived importance for achieving popularity. Demographic information, including gender, age, race, and school district type, was also collected.

The resulting dataset contains a total of cases.
