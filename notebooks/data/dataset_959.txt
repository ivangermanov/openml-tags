The Nursery Data Set is a collection of information related to chemistry, life science, and myth-busting. It was originally converted into a binarized version, where the multi-class target feature was transformed into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

This data set explores various aspects, including the influence of parents, nursery availability, family structure, number of children, housing conditions, financial situation, social environment, and health factors on the outcome. These factors were carefully selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between them.
