Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version). The multi-class target feature is converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). Originally converted by an individual researcher.

This dataset focuses on nursery school admissions and includes various factors that may influence the decision-making process. The features encompass parental information, nursery availability, application form details, number of children, housing situation, financial status, social circumstances, and health considerations. The target variable has been simplified to a binary classification, distinguishing between positive and negative outcomes for nursery admissions.

The dataset aims to provide insights into the complex factors affecting nursery placements and could be valuable for researchers studying early childhood education policies and practices. By converting the original multi-class problem into a binary classification, the dataset allows for more straightforward analysis of the primary factors influencing positive admission outcomes.
