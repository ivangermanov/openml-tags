First Order Theorem Proving

Tags: OpenML CC, OpenML, study

Dataset Information:
This dataset pertains to first-order theorem proving, focusing on machine learning techniques to select effective heuristics. The data originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is associated with research conducted at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The study explores the application of machine learning methods to improve automated reasoning systems, specifically in the domain of first-order logic theorem proving.

The dataset comprises a mixture of static and dynamic features derived from theorems to be proved. These features capture various aspects of the theorem-proving process, including characteristics of the logical formulas, proof search strategies, and intermediate results during the proving attempt. The goal is to use these features to train machine learning models that can predict which heuristics are likely to be most effective for a given theorem-proving task.

Researchers interested in automated reasoning, theorem proving, and the application of machine learning to formal methods may find this dataset particularly valuable. It provides a rich set of examples that can be used to develop and evaluate algorithms for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of automated theorem provers.

The full details of the feature set and the methodology used to generate the data are described in the associated research paper. This paper discusses the challenges of applying machine learning to theorem proving and presents results demonstrating the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of automated reasoning systems.

Attribute Information:
The dataset includes numerous features, labeled V through V, which represent various aspects of the theorem-proving process. These features are designed to capture relevant information that can be used to predict the effectiveness of different proving strategies. The specific meaning and interpretation of each feature are detailed in the accompanying research paper.

The target variable, labeled as "Class," likely represents the effectiveness or success of a particular heuristic or proving strategy for each instance in the dataset.
