QSAR-TID-19639 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 19639. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains 958 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, September 2015.

The drug target is Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4, also known as IRAK4. It is a single protein and a member of the TKL protein kinase group. It is involved in various biological processes, including toll-like receptor signaling pathway, immune system process, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway.

The dataset provides information on the protein's structure, function, and interactions. It includes data on the protein's expression, localization, and phosphorylation. It also provides information on the protein's role in various diseases, including invasive pneumococcal disease and recurrent isolated invasive pneumococcal disease.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 and its role in various biological processes and diseases.
