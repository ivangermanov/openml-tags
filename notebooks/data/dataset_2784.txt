**Data Description**
This is the historical price data of the Forex Euro/Norwegian Krone (EUR/NOK) from Dukascopy. Each instance represents one candlestick of one day. The entire dataset spans from January first to December thirteenth and excludes weekends, as the Forex market is not active during these days. The timestamp feature is set to the Europe/Amsterdam timezone.

The class attribute denotes the direction of the mean high price of the subsequent day, relative to the mean high price of the current day. Specifically, the class attribute is true when the mean high price increases the following day, and false when it decreases or remains stagnant.

**Note that this is a hypothetical task, intended solely for scientific purposes. Realistic trading strategies can only be applied to predictions based on closing prices (also available).**
