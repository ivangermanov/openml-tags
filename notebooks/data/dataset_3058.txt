QSAR-TID-10444 Dataset 

This dataset contains Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10444. It has forty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The features represent Fingerprint Chemical Fragments 1024 bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by numerous Fingerprint Chemical Fragments features.

This dataset was sourced from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

Trypsin is a single protein, also known as trypsin synonyms, and is found in the species Sus scrofa. It belongs to the enzyme/protease/serine protease/serine protease PA clan/serine protease S1A subfamily classification. 

Trypsin is located in the extracellular region and extracellular space. Its functions include serine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. 

Trypsin is involved in various biological processes, including proteolysis and digestion.
