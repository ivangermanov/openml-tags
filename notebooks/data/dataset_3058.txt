QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo pCI units) of various compounds on drug target TID. The dataset comprises rows and features, including molecule identifiers and median pXC values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on a single protein target, trypsin, from Sus scrofa (pig). Trypsin is classified as a serine protease in the PA clan, S1A subfamily. It is found in the extracellular region and space, with functions including serine type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, and metal ion binding. Trypsin is involved in proteolysis and digestion processes.

The target protein has several associated identifiers in various databases, including canSAR Target, IntAct, UniProt, and InterPro. It is characterized by multiple domains and motifs, such as the trypsin domain, peptidase S1A, and specific trypsin histidine and serine sites. The protein structure has been determined and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDBe) with numerous entries.

This QSAR dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is intended for use in quantitative structure activity relationship studies. Researchers utilizing this data are requested to cite the original source appropriately.
