This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase One, and it has twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PX C fifty.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project.

This dataset is related to economics and life science, particularly in the field of mitogen-activated protein kinases.

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase One is a single protein preferred name with synonyms including Erk Two, Erk-Two, Ert One, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Two, and Mapk.

It belongs to the enzyme kinase protein kinase CMGC protein kinase group CMGC protein kinase MAPK family CMGC protein kinase ERK.

Description relationship accession mitogen-activated protein kinase one single protein.

The dataset also includes information about protein target classification, protein function, and protein process.
