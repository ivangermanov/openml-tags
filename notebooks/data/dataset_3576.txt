QSAR-TID-100895 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 100895. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets.

The target protein, Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase One, is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is a key component of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

The protein is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, and is involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA damage response. It is also involved in various disease processes, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory diseases.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers to develop and validate QSAR models for Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase One, which can be used for the design and discovery of new drugs.
