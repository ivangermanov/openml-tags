QSAR-TID-12480 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane A2 Receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: Molecule ChEMBL ID, and multiple FCFP6 features.

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Thromboxane A2 Receptor. The dataset has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Thromboxane A2 Receptor is a single protein and its preferred name is Thromboxane A2 Receptor. It also has synonyms such as Prostanoid TP Receptor, Tbxa2r, Thromboxane A2 Receptor, TXA2-R, and TXR2. The organism is Rattus norvegicus and it belongs to the species group. The protein target classification is one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, family A GPCR, lipid-like ligand receptor, and prostanoid receptor.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was created in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The Thromboxane A2 Receptor is involved in multiple biological processes such as smooth muscle contraction, inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is also involved in positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, response to nutrient, response to xenobiotic stimulus, regulation of vasoconstriction, and second-messenger-mediated signaling.
