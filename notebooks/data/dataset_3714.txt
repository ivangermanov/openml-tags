QSAR-TID-11119 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11119. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The dataset contains a total of one thousand and twenty-six features, including the molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc50.

The target protein is Dipeptidyl Peptidase Four, which is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. It is a serine protease that is involved in the cleavage of peptides and proteins. The protein is also known as CD26 and is a cell surface glycoprotein.

The dataset is useful for researchers who are interested in developing QSAR models for Dipeptidyl Peptidase Four. The data can be used to train machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds against this target protein.
