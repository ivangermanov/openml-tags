This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Dipeptidyl Peptidase Four, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc Fifty.

The features represent Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and was published in September two thousand fifteen. It should be cited accordingly.

The drug target is a single protein known as Dipeptidyl Peptidase Four, also referred to as Bile Canaliculus Domain-Specific Membrane Glycoprotein, CD Twenty Six, among other synonyms. It belongs to the species Rattus Norvegicus and is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, serine protease SC clan, and serine protease S Nine B subfamily.

The protein target classification is one point enzyme, protease, serine protease, serine protease SC clan, and serine protease S Nine B subfamily.
