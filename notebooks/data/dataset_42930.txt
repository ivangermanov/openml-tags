This dataset combines five individual datasets, namely QCM Three, QCM Six, QCM Seven, QCM Ten, and QCM Twelve, each containing twenty-five entries representing one original dataset respectively.

The classification of alcohols involves five types: One Octanol, One Propanol, Two Butanol, Two Propanol, and One Isobutanol. The gas sample is passed through the sensor in five different concentrations, which are: Concentration One with an air ratio of point seven nine nine milliliters and a gas ratio of point two zero one milliliters, Concentration Two with an air ratio of point seven zero zero milliliters and a gas ratio of point three zero zero milliliters, Concentration Three with an air ratio of point six zero zero milliliters and a gas ratio of point four zero zero milliliters, Concentration Four with an air ratio of point five zero one milliliters and a gas ratio of point four nine nine milliliters, and Concentration Five with an air ratio of point four zero zero milliliters and a gas ratio of point six zero zero milliliters.

The QCM sensors have two channels, with one circle forming Channel One and the other forming Channel Two. The MIP and MP ratios used in the QCM sensors vary according to the sensor type.
