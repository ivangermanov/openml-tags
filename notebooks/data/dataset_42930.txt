The dataset consists of five types of datasets: QCM Three, QCM Six, QCM Seven, QCM Ten, and QCM Twelve. Each dataset contains alcohol classification of five types: One-Octanol, One-Propanol, Two-Butanol, Two-Propanol, and One-Isobutanol. The five datasets are merged into one dataset, with each twenty-five entries representing one original dataset, respectively.

The gas sample is passed through the sensor in five different concentrations. These concentrations are: Concentration Air Ratio, Gas Ratio; Concentration One, Air Ratio point seven nine nine, Gas Ratio point two zero one; Concentration Two, Air Ratio point seven zero zero, Gas Ratio point three zero zero; Concentration Three, Air Ratio point six zero zero, Gas Ratio point four zero zero; Concentration Four, Air Ratio point five zero one, Gas Ratio point four nine nine; Concentration Five, Air Ratio point four zero zero, Gas Ratio point six zero zero.

There are two channels in the sensor. One of these circles forms Channel One, and the other forms Channel Two. MIP and MP ratios used in the QCM sensors are: Sensor Name, MIP Ratio, NP Ratio; QCM Three, One, One; QCM Six, One, Zero; QCM Seven, One, point five; QCM Ten, One, Two; QCM Twelve, Zero, One.
