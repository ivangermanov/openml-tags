The probable risk factors for coronary thrombosis comprise data from men, which provides valuable insights into this critical health issue.

The coronary data set contains six variables that are crucial in understanding the correlation between various factors and coronary thrombosis. These variables include smoking status, whether an individual engages in strenuous mental work, whether they engage in strenuous physical work, their systolic blood pressure level, the ratio of beta and alpha lipoproteins in their body, and their family medical history of coronary heart disease.

Smoking status is categorized into two groups: those who smoke and those who do not. Similarly, individuals who engage in strenuous mental work are classified into two groups: those who do and those who do not. The same applies to strenuous physical work. Systolic blood pressure level is classified into two categories: less than one hundred forty and greater than one hundred forty. The ratio of beta and alpha lipoproteins is also categorized into two groups: less than three and greater than three. Lastly, family medical history of coronary heart disease is classified into two categories: negative and positive.

This dataset has been sourced from reputable publications that have extensively studied the correlation between these factors and coronary thrombosis.
