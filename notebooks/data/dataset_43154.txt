**Coronary Dataset**
Tags: **Dataset Description**

This dataset comprises probable risk factors for coronary thrombosis, consisting of data from a large group of men. The dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the various factors that contribute to the risk of coronary heart disease.

* Strenuous Mental Work: a two-level factor indicating whether the individual engages in strenuous mental work or not
* Strenuous Physical Work: a two-level factor indicating whether the individual engages in strenuous physical work or not
* Systolic Blood Pressure: a two-level factor indicating whether the individual's systolic blood pressure is less than or greater than a certain threshold
* Lipoprotein Ratio: a two-level factor indicating whether the ratio of beta and alpha lipoproteins is less than or greater than a certain threshold
* Family History of Coronary Heart Disease: a two-level factor indicating whether there is a family history of coronary heart disease or not
