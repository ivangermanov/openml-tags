Name: Cover Type Seed Two

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Cover Type with seed equals two

This dataset is a subsample of the original Cover Type dataset. It was generated using a specific source code that involves random sampling of classes, columns, and rows. The subsampling process ensures that the resulting dataset is stratified, meaning that the class distribution is preserved.

The dataset features a selection of variables, including Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Horizontal Distance to Hydrology, Vertical Distance to Hydrology, Horizontal Distance to Roadways, Hillshade at nine am, Hillshade at noon, Hillshade at three pm, Horizontal Distance to Fire Points, and Wilderness Area. Additionally, it includes various Soil Types.

The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows. The class sampling was done using a random number generator, and the column sampling was done by selecting a specified number of columns at random. The row sampling was done using a stratified sampling approach to ensure that the class distribution is preserved.

The resulting dataset has a specified number of rows, columns, and classes. The dataset is suitable for machine learning and data analysis tasks.
