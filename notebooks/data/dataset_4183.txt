Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "Regression on Numerical Features" benchmark.

This dataset contains houses to rent with thirteen different features. Please note that some values in the dataset can be considered as outliers for further analysis. It is also important to bear in mind that the web crawler was used only to gather the data, so it is possible that errors in the original data exist.

There may be changes in the data between versions of the dataset since the web crawler was run on different days for each version of the dataset. These changes could include added or deleted houses, as well as added cities.

This dataset corresponds to the second version of the original dataset. The value 'hyphen' in the attribute floor was replaced by 'zero' as the data contributor stated that this refers to houses with just one floor.

Features: area, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, parking spaces, Homeowners Association fee, rent amount, property tax, fire insurance, total cost
