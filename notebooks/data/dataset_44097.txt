**German Credit Dataset**

This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. It comes with a cost matrix, which indicates that it is worse to classify a customer as good when they are bad than it is to classify a customer as bad when they are good.

### Attribute Description

The dataset consists of twenty attributes that describe the creditworthiness of an individual. These attributes include the status of their existing checking account, duration in months, credit history, purpose of the credit, credit amount, status of savings account or bonds, present employment in years, installment rate in percentage of disposable income, personal status and sex, other debtors or guarantors, present residence since, property, age in years, other installment plans, housing, number of existing credits at this bank, job, number of people being liable to provide maintenance for, telephone, and foreign worker status.

The cost matrix for this dataset is as follows:

Good (predicted) | Good (actual) | Bad (actual)
----------------|--------------|-------------
Good            | 0            | 1
Bad             | 5            | 0

This dataset requires the use of a cost matrix, which takes into account the different costs associated with misclassifying a customer as good or bad.

### Additional Information

Two datasets are provided. The original dataset contains categorical or symbolic attributes and is in the file "german.data". For algorithms that need numerical attributes, a second file "german.data-numeric" is provided, which has been edited and several indicator variables added to make it suitable for algorithms that cannot cope with categorical variables. Several attributes that are ordered categorical have been coded as integers.
