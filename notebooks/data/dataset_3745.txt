QSAR-TID-10684 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10684. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset has 122 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version 17, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10684. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The MetaQSAR project, which was conducted in September 2015, aimed to provide a comprehensive dataset for QSAR modeling. The project involved generating molecular fingerprints from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of QSAR modeling and drug discovery. It provides a comprehensive set of molecular fingerprints and activity values for several compounds, which can be used to develop and validate QSAR models.

The dataset is particularly useful for researchers working on drug target TID: 10684, as it provides a comprehensive set of molecular fingerprints and activity values for several compounds. The dataset can be used to develop and validate QSAR models, which can aid in the discovery of new drugs and the optimization of existing ones.
