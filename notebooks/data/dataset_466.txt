The Friedman datasets consist of eighty artificially generated datasets originating from stochastic gradient boosting. 

The dataset names are coded as "friedman colinearity degree sample number feature number". Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for data generation, which includes both linear and nonlinear relations between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output.

The Friedman function is a complex equation that involves sine and exponential operations of the input variables, with a noise term added to the output. 

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of nonrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. 

However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to colinearity, the datasets are generated with five different colinearity degrees. The colinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features.

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies, with only the first five features being related to the output; the rest are completely random.

The number of samples also varies.

Colinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a colinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated differently. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by combining different feature numbers, sample numbers, and colinearity degrees.

The last attribute in each file is the target.
