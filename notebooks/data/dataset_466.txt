Information about the dataset:
Class type: nominal
Class index: last

Features: ID, target, gain ratio, sex, class

This dataset contains eye tracking data collected from individuals with schizophrenia. It was originally analyzed and published in a Biometrics journal article. The data includes various gain ratio measurements, likely related to eye movement patterns, as well as demographic information like sex. The class variable is the last feature listed, suggesting this may be used for classification tasks related to schizophrenia diagnosis or subtyping. Researchers interested in using this data should cite the original Biometrics publication. The nominal class type indicates categorical variables are present. This dataset could be valuable for studies on visual processing differences in schizophrenia or developing diagnostic tools based on eye tracking metrics.
