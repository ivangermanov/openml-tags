This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset contains various features including Buoy, Day, Latitude, Longitude, Air Temperature, and Humidity. These features have been carefully selected to provide valuable insights into the underlying relationships between them.
