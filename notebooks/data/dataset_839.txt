The Audiology Dataset is a collection of data related to chemistry and life sciences, specifically focusing on debunking myths and conducting studies in the field of audiology.

This dataset has undergone a binarization process, where the multi-class target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all other classes as Negative.

The dataset consists of various features, including Age Greater Than Sixty, Air Conduction, Air Bone Gap, Acoustic Reflex, and many more. These features are primarily related to auditory measurements and patient history.

Originally, this dataset was converted from its multi-class form to its current binarized state.
