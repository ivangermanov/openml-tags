Please cite: This dataset is a binarized version of the original El Nino dataset. It transforms the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This modification allows for binary classification tasks and comparative analyses.

The dataset contains various meteorological and oceanographic measurements collected from buoys in the Pacific Ocean. These measurements include temporal and spatial information, wind patterns, humidity levels, and air temperature. The binarized class serves as the target variable for predictive modeling and analysis.

Features include buoy identifiers, day of measurement, latitude and longitude coordinates, zonal and meridional wind components, humidity readings, air temperature recordings, and the binarized class label.

This dataset is particularly useful for researchers and data scientists interested in climate studies, weather pattern analysis, and binary classification problems in environmental sciences.
