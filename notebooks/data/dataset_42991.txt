Digital Colposcopy Hinselmann Dataset

The dataset was acquired and annotated by professional physicians at a hospital. The subjective judgments, originally done in an ordinal manner, were discretized into two classes. Images were randomly sampled from the original colposcopic sequences. The original images and manual segmentations are included in the images directory. The dataset has three modalities. The target variables are expert assessments and consensus.

The dataset has no missing values.

The dataset features include:

* Cervix area, which is the image area with cervix
* External os area, which is the image area with external os
* Vaginal walls area, which is the image area with vaginal walls
* Speculum area, which is the image area with the speculum
* Artifacts area, which is the image area with artifacts
* Cervix artifacts area, which is the cervix area with artifacts
