The Bank Marketing dataset belongs to the classification on numerical features benchmark.

This dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, often requiring more than one contact to the same client to assess whether the product, specifically a bank term deposit, would be subscribed.

The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit.
