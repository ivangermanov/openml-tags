QSAR-TID-11054 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 4, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 4. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature.

Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 4 is a Single Protein Preferred Name, also known as GPRC1D, GRM4, mGluR4, and MGLUR4. It is a Membrane receptor, Family C G protein-coupled receptor, Small molecule receptor, and Neurotransmitter receptor. The receptor is involved in cell communication, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and chemical synaptic transmission.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, and it is recommended to cite the dataset when using it.
