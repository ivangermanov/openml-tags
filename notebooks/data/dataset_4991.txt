Win95pts Bayesian Network Sample 6

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference

This network consists of a large number of nodes and arcs, resulting in a complex structure.

The Win95pts network has a large number of nodes, which are connected by a significant number of arcs.

Each node in the network represents a specific feature, and the arcs between them represent the relationships between these features.

Some of the notable features in this network include Print Port, Network Print, Print Driver, and Printer Status Off.

These features are related to printing and networking, suggesting that this network may be used to model and analyze printer-related problems.

Other features, such as Available Virtual Memory and Printer Paper, indicate that this network may also consider system resources and printer settings.

The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the nodes suggest that each feature is connected to a moderate number of other features.

This complexity makes it challenging to analyze and understand the relationships between the features in this network.
