QSAR-TID-11003 Dataset

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11003. It has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class features.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen.

Melanocortin Receptor Three

The melanocortin receptor three is a single protein target, also known as MC three R or melanocortin receptor three. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified as a one membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and short peptide receptor.

It has synonyms such as MC three R and melanocortin receptor three. The description of this receptor states that it is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of heart rate, signal transduction, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways.

It also participates in the regulation of metabolic processes, circadian rhythms, and locomotor rhythms. Additionally, it plays a role in sodium ion homeostasis and the regulation of feeding behavior.

The melanocortin receptor three has been associated with various diseases and disorders, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
