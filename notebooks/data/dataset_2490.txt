This dataset is part of a collection of datasets based on the game Jungle Chess, also known as Dou Shou Qi. For a description of the rules, please refer to the attached paper. The paper also contains a detailed description of various constructed features.

As the tablebases are a disjoint set of several tablebases based on which two pieces are on the board, we have uploaded all tablebases that have explicit different content. These include:

Rat versus Rat
Rat versus Panther
Rat versus Lion
Rat versus Elephant
Panther versus Lion
Panther versus Elephant
Tiger versus Lion
Lion versus Lion
Lion versus Elephant
Elephant versus Elephant
Complete (Combination of the above)
Raw Complete (Combination of the above, containing for both pieces just the rank, file, and strength information)

This dataset contains a similar classification problem as, for example, the King and Rook versus King problem and is suitable for classification tasks. Note that this dataset is one of the above-mentioned datasets. Additionally, note that several subproblems are very similar. Having seen a given position from one of the tablebases arguably gives a lot of information about the outcome of the same position in the other tablebases.

Features include:
White Piece Strength
White Piece File
White Piece Rank
Black Piece Strength
Black Piece File
