This dataset contains Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. It has multiple rows and numerous features, including IDs and class feature. The features represent Folded Chemical Fingerprint (FCFP) molecular fingerprints, which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, created in September 2015. It contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target. The activity values are measured in units of pseudo-pCI50.
