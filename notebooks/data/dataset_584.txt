The Friedman Datasets are eighty artificially generated datasets originating from a specific source. 

These dataset names are coded as "Friedman Colinearity Degree Sample Number Feature Number". 

Friedman is one of the most widely used functions for generating data. This function includes both linear and nonlinear relationships between input and output, and a normalized noise is added to the output. 

The Friedman function is as follows: y equals ten times the sine of pi times x one times x two plus twenty times the square of x three minus point five equals ten times X four plus five times X five plus e.

In the original Friedman function, there are five features for input. To measure the effects of unrelated features, additional features are added to the datasets. These added features are independent from the output. However, to measure the algorithm's robustness to collinearity, the datasets are generated with five different collinearity degrees. 

The collinearity degree is the number of features depending on other features. 

The generated Friedman dataset's parameters and values are given below:

The number of features varies, with only the first five features being related to the output; the rest are completely random. 

The number of samples also varies. 

Collinearity degrees range from zero to four. 

For the datasets with a collinearity degree of four, the number of features is generated differently than for the others. 

As a result, eighty artificial datasets are generated by varying these parameters.

The last attribute in each file is the target.

Features include various variables, although some may not be easily readable.
