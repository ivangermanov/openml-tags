Space GA Dataset 

This is a binarized regression problem dataset, specifically designed for chemistry and life science studies. It is also relevant to myth-busting and various study areas.

The original dataset has been modified to create this binarized version. The numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset includes several features that describe different aspects of the data. These include population-based metrics, education levels, housing information, income data, and geographic coordinates.
