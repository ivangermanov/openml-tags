This dataset is sourced from a publication on statistical smoothing techniques. It contains information related to gasoline consumption, which is treated as the primary attribute of interest. The dataset includes various economic indicators and factors that may influence gasoline usage over time.

Features included in the dataset are:
- Year
- Price index for gasoline
- Disposable income
- Price index for used cars
- Gasoline consumption

This dataset provides valuable information for researchers and analysts studying trends in fuel consumption and its relationship to economic factors. It can be used to explore patterns, conduct statistical analyses, and develop predictive models related to gasoline usage.

The data offers insights into how variables such as income levels, gasoline prices, and the cost of alternative transportation options (represented by used car prices) may impact overall gasoline consumption patterns over time.
