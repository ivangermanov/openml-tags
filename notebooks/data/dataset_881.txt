Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N'). This transformation allows for binary classification analysis of the previously continuous data.

The dataset contains multiple features, including various numeric attributes and a binary class label. These features represent different aspects of the data points and are used to predict the binary outcome. The binarization process enables researchers to apply classification algorithms and techniques to what was originally a regression problem, potentially revealing new insights or patterns in the data.

By converting the continuous target variable into a binary classification, this dataset provides opportunities for comparative analysis between regression and classification approaches on the same underlying data. This transformation may be particularly useful for machine learning practitioners and researchers interested in exploring the differences and similarities between these two types of predictive modeling tasks.
