Municipal Debt Risk Analysis
Tags: Machine Learning, Statistics

Context:
This dataset has been extracted from the billing systems of municipalities in South Africa over a two-year period and summarized according to their total amount billed versus the total amount paid. For each account, there is an indicator of whether that account resulted in a Bad Debt. This is a classification exercise aimed at determining the feasibility of predicting the probability of an account becoming a Bad Debt, thereby enabling the forecasting of the number and value of accounts at risk of developing into a Bad Debt.

Content:
The dataset comprises various attributes that describe the characteristics of municipal accounts. These include the account category, property value, property size, total billing, average billing, total receipting, average receipting, total debt, total write-off, collection ratio, debt-to-billing ratio, total electricity bill, and an indication of whether the account holder has an identification number. The presence of an identification number suggests that the account is held by an individual rather than a business, which may impact the likelihood of debt recovery.

The primary objective of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that can identify accounts at risk of becoming Bad Debts. By doing so, municipalities can take proactive measures to mitigate potential losses and optimize their revenue management strategies.
