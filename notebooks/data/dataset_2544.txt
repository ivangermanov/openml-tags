The OkCupid-stem dataset, tagged with Computer Systems and Manufacturing, contains user profile data for individuals living in San Francisco. This curated dataset was obtained from GitHub and originally created using a Python script that extracted information from public profiles on OkCupid.com. The dataset consists of individuals within a twenty-five-mile radius of San Francisco who were active online within the past year and had at least one profile picture.

The dataset's target variable, job, was categorized into three groups: stem, non-stem, and student. Stem jobs include those related to computer hardware and software, as well as science, technology, and engineering. Observations with unemployed, retired, or rather not say as their job, or those with missing job values, were removed.

In addition to the job category, the dataset includes various demographic and personal characteristics, such as age, body type, dietary preferences, drinking habits, drug use, educational background, ethnicity, height, income, location, number of children, sexual orientation, pet ownership, religious beliefs, gender, astrological sign, smoking habits, languages spoken, and relationship status.

The inclusion of the date and time of last online activity provides an opportunity to construct additional features. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for exploring the predictive capabilities of various characteristics on stem job occupations, inspired by the concept of feature engineering and selection.
