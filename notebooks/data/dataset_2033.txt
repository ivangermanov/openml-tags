This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-100288, falls under the categories of Machine Learning and MTLQSAR, and is part of the MetaQSAR project, which was conducted in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data, showcasing activity values of various compounds on the drug target TID: 100288. It consists of thirty-three rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating fingerprints typically does not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated. The features include molecule ChEMBL ID and median PXc fifty.

The dataset is related to a single protein, specifically the human herpesvirus five chemokine receptor, also known as G-protein coupled receptor homolog US twenty-eight. This receptor is found in the human cytomegalovirus strain AD one sixty-nine, also referred to as HHV-five or human herpesvirus five.

The protein target classification falls under the category of one point membrane receptor slash family A G protein-coupled receptor slash peptide receptor, and is further classified as a CC chemokine receptor.

In terms of gene ontology, this receptor is associated with various biological processes, including chemotaxis, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, mitigation of host antiviral defense response, evasion of host immune response via modulation of host cytokine network, positive regulation by virus of host cell division, and chemokine-mediated signaling pathway.

Additionally, this receptor is linked to various cellular components, including the membrane, host cell plasma membrane, and host cell membrane. In terms of molecular function, it exhibits G protein-coupled receptor activity, chemokine receptor activity, and protein binding.
