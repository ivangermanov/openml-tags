Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 8.

bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - Munin Bayesian Network Repository.

The Munin dataset is a massive Bayesian network consisting of nodes and arcs, with a large number of parameters. The average Markov blanket size is moderate, and the average degree is relatively low. The maximum in-degree is relatively small.

The Munin dataset is an expert EMG assistant, designed to provide assistance in electromyography. It is a comprehensive system that integrates multiple features and variables to provide a detailed analysis of electromyographic data.

Features of the Munin dataset include muscle activity, electromyographic signals, and various other physiological and clinical parameters. These features are used to analyze and diagnose various muscle and nerve disorders.

Keywords: Bayesian network, electromyography, muscle activity, clinical diagnosis.
