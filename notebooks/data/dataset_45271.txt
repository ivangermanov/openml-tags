Munin Bayesian Network. Sample 8.

The Munin dataset is a comprehensive repository of Bayesian networks, specifically designed for discrete massive datasets. This particular sample, Munin 8, boasts an impressive number of nodes and arcs, making it an ideal choice for researchers and analysts seeking to explore complex relationships within large-scale data.

The network comprises numerous features, including muscle activity indicators, electromyography readings, and muscle disease characteristics. These features are meticulously organized into a cohesive structure, allowing users to navigate and analyze the data with ease.

The average Markov blanket size and average degree of the network indicate a moderate level of complexity, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The maximum in-degree suggests that certain nodes have a significant impact on the overall network behavior.

This dataset has been carefully curated to provide a rich source of information for those interested in exploring the intricacies of Bayesian networks.
