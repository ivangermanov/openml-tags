QSAR-TID-36 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 36. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings.

The Progesterone Receptor is a single protein target, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 3, or PGR. It is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including ovulation, epithelial cell maturation, and glandular epithelial cell maturation.

The receptor is involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, and signal transduction. It also participates in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, cell-cell signaling, and paracrine signaling.

The Progesterone Receptor is a nuclear hormone receptor that binds to steroids, such as progesterone, and regulates gene expression. It is a key player in the development and function of the mammary gland, lung, and other tissues.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling and virtual screening.
