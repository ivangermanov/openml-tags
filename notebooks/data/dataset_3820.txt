Pantheon Project: Celebrating Global Cultural Heritage Through Data Analysis

The Pantheon project is an initiative dedicated to commemorating the rich cultural information that has enabled humanity to achieve remarkable feats. To honor our collective cultural legacy, we are compiling, examining, and visualizing vast datasets that provide valuable insights into the evolution of global culture.

At the heart of the Pantheon lies a comprehensive database that measures the worldwide popularity of historical figures using two distinct metrics. The first metric, denoted as Language Presence, represents the number of unique Wikipedia language editions featuring an article about a particular historical figure. This metric offers a baseline understanding of a figure's global recognition.

The second, more advanced metric is the Historical Popularity Index, which refines Language Presence by incorporating additional factors such as the age of the historical figure, linguistic diversity of page views, variability in page views across languages, and page views in non-English languages. These variables provide a more nuanced understanding of a figure's enduring impact and widespread appeal.

To delve deeper into the significance of specific values, please refer to the column metadata section. A more detailed explanation of the methodology behind the Historical Popularity Index is available on the Pantheon website.
