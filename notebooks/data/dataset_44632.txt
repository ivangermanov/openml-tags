Subsampling of the dataset KC One with Seed Four 
Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics 

This is a subsampled version of the KC One dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involves selecting a uniform sample of classes, columns, and rows from the original dataset. 

The first step is to uniformly sample classes from the unique values present in the target variable. If the number of unique classes exceeds the maximum allowed, a random selection is made based on their frequency distribution. This ensures that the sampled classes are representative of the original distribution.

Next, the columns are sampled uniformly, selecting a specified maximum number of columns. This is done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the most important features.

Finally, the rows are sampled, taking into account the class distribution to maintain stratification. This ensures that the resulting subsampled dataset has a similar class balance to the original dataset.

The resulting subsampled dataset contains a reduced number of features and samples, making it more manageable for machine learning tasks.

Features: location, variance of g, expected value of g, importance value of g, node count, variance, length, depth, index, entropy, branch count, defects.
