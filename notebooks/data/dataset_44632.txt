Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a dataset and returns a new dataset that is a subsample of the original. It does this by first uniformly sampling classes from the dataset, then uniformly sampling columns, and finally uniformly sampling rows. The function uses the numpy random default random generator to ensure reproducibility.

The function first gets the unique classes in the dataset and selects a specified number of them. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and uses these indices to subset the dataset. Next, it uniformly samples columns from the dataset, selecting a specified number of them. If the dataset has more rows than the specified maximum, it uses the train test split function from scikit learn to stratify the dataset and select a specified number of rows.

The function returns a new dataset with the subsampled data, along with the categorical mask and column names.
