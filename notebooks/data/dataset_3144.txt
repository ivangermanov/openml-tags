QSAR-TID-100836 Tags: MTLQSAR, Physical Sciences, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred thousand eight hundred thirty-six, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc fifty. 

The features represent FCFP one thousand twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systemes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one thousand twenty-four zero through ninety-eight, and many more.

This dataset was scraped from various sources including ChEMBL, Expression Atlas, Gene Ontology, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. 

It contains information about the Serine Threonine-Protein Kinase NEK seven, also known as Never in Mitosis A-Related Kinase seven or NimA-Related Protein Kinase seven. It is a single protein found in humans and belongs to the enzyme kinase protein kinase other protein kinase group, specifically the NEK family.

This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein phosphorylation, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, phosphorylation, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, and many others. It is also associated with certain components, such as the spindle pole, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, microtubule organizing center, cytoskeleton, and microtubule.
