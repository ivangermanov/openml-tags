The Consumer Credit Department of a bank wants to automate the decision-making process for approval of home equity lines of credit. To do this, they will follow the recommendations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to create an empirically derived and statistically sound credit scoring model. The model will be based on data collected from recent applicants granted credit through the current process of loan underwriting. The model will be built from predictive modeling tools, but the created model must be sufficiently interpretable to provide a reason for any adverse actions or rejections.

The Home Equity dataset, HMEQ, contains baseline and loan performance information for recent home equity loans. The target variable, Bad, is a binary variable indicating whether an applicant eventually defaulted or was seriously delinquent. This adverse outcome occurred in cases where the applicant was unable to meet their loan obligations. For each applicant, twelve input variables were recorded, including loan information, credit history, and demographic data.

The goal of the project is to create a credit scoring model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on their loan, while also providing a clear explanation for any adverse actions taken. This will enable the bank to make more informed lending decisions and reduce the risk of default.
