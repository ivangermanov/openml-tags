This dataset is an implementation of the twonorm example. It is a twenty dimensional, two class classification example. Each class is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with unit variance. Class one has a mean of (a,a,..a) while Class two has a mean of (negative a, negative a,..negative a), where a equals two divided by the square root of twenty. The theoretical expected misclassification rate is reported to be two point three percent. When using three hundred training examples with CART, an error of twenty two point one percent was found.
