QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values of various compounds on drug target TID. The activity unit is pseudo pCI. The dataset comprises several rows and numerous features, including molecule identifiers and class features such as MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC.

The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program by Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Elastase, a single protein target also known as CELA, Chymotrypsin like elastase family member, ELA, Elastase, and Pancreatic elastase. This protein is found in Homo sapiens and belongs to the Enzyme/Protease/Serine protease/Serine protease PA clan/Serine protease SA subfamily classification.

Elastase is involved in various biological processes including transcription regulation, proteolysis, inflammatory response, post embryonic development, Wnt signaling pathway, exocrine pancreas development, multicellular organism growth, cell population proliferation regulation, cell differentiation regulation, angiogenesis regulation, tissue remodeling, digestive system development, elastin catabolic process, and pancreas morphogenesis.

The protein's cellular components include the extracellular region and extracellular space. Its molecular functions encompass serine type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding.

This dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and is associated with several database entries including UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and others. It provides valuable information for researchers studying drug interactions and protein functions.
