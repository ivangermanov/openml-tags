The QSAR-TID-208 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 208. This dataset has twenty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset contains data scraped from various sources, including protein target classification, description, and relationship accession. The protein target is classified as an enzyme, protease, serine protease, and belongs to the serine protease PA clan and S one A subfamily. 

The description of this protein target is Chymotrypsin-like elastase family member one, also known as CELA one, ELA one, pancreatic elastase one, and others. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens.

This protein target has various gene ontology functions, including serine-type endopeptidase activity, peptidase activity, serine-type peptidase activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. 

It is involved in various biological processes, including negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, transcription by RNA polymerase two, proteolysis, inflammatory response, post-embryonic development, Wnt signaling pathway, exocrine pancreas development, multicellular organism growth, regulation of cell population proliferation, regulation of cell differentiation, positive regulation of angiogenesis, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase two, tissue remodeling, digestive system development, and elastin catabolic process.
