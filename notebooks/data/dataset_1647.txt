This dataset, known as QSAR-TID-102981, falls under the categories of Economics and Life Science, and is part of the MTLQSAR study three. It was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September 2015.

The dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 102981. There are thirty-two rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class features, namely, Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

These features represent FCFP six hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. 

Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated. 

The dataset is related to the A1 adenosine receptor, also known as Adenosine Receptor A1, which is a single protein and belongs to the species group Sus scrofa. 

It is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, and nucleotide-like receptor. Its function includes G protein-coupled adenosine receptor activity and G protein-coupled receptor activity. 

It is involved in various biological processes, including G protein-coupled adenosine receptor signaling pathway, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, vasoconstriction, and response to stimulus.

Keywords: QSAR, adenosine receptor, molecular fingerprints, G protein-coupled receptor, signal transduction.
