Urban Dictionary Terms Dataset

I scraped all of the currently available Urban Dictionary pages, which resulted in a comprehensive collection of slang terms. This dataset contains the slang term, its definition, the user who contributed the term, a list of relevant hashtags, the number of upvotes and downvotes, and the date the term was added to Urban Dictionary.

The dataset features include the definition of the slang term, the word itself, the tags associated with it, the number of upvotes and downvotes, and the date it was added to the dictionary.

Acknowledgements: I would like to extend my gratitude to the individual who inspired me to scrape these terms.

Keywords: Urban Dictionary, slang terms, dataset, definitions, hashtags, upvotes, downvotes.
