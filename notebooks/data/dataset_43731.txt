I scraped all of the currently available Urban Dictionary pages on a specific date. This dataset is named Urban Dictionary Terms.

The dataset contains information about each slang term, including the Slang Term itself, its Definition, the User Account that contributed it, a list of relevant Tags, the number of Upvotes it received, the number of Downvotes, and the Date it was added to Urban Dictionary.

I would like to acknowledge the inspiration behind this project, which came from a conversation with a friend.

Features of this dataset include the definition of each term, the slang term itself, the associated tags, the number of upvotes, the number of downvotes, and the date it was added.
