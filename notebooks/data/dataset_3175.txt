The QSAR-TID-103900 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project and contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Type One Angiotensin II Receptor. This dataset has seventy-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent Fingerprints of molecular structure, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These Fingerprints do not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset is related to the study of the computational universe and machine learning, specifically Multi Task Learning QSAR. It is a valuable resource for researchers working on understanding the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity.

The Type One Angiotensin II Receptor is a single protein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including kidney development, maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis, and signal transduction. It is also involved in the regulation of vasoconstriction, calcium-mediated signaling, and viral entry into host cells.

This receptor is classified as a membrane receptor and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It has various synonyms, including AGTR1, Angiotensin II Type-One Receptor, and AT-One Receptor.

The dataset provides information about the receptor's function, including its ability to bind to bradykinin and its involvement in protein heterodimerization activity. It also includes data about the receptor's cellular component, which is primarily located in the plasma membrane.
