The Red Wine Quality dataset is related to the red variant of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available. These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, meaning there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.

This dataset is also available from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains physicochemical input variables based on tests, including acidity, citric acid, sugar, chlorides, sulfur dioxide, density, pH, and sulfates. The output variable is based on sensory data, specifically the quality of the wine scored between zero and ten.

A potential approach to exploring this dataset is to set an arbitrary cutoff for the dependent variable, classifying wines with a score of seven or higher as "good" and the remainder as "not good". This allows for practice with hyperparameter tuning on decision tree algorithms, examining the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve value. Without feature engineering or overfitting, it is possible to achieve an area under the curve value of point eight eight.

A useful tool for working with this dataset is KNIME, a graphical user interface that enables users to perform various tasks. One approach is to begin with file reading and linear correlation nodes, followed by interactive histograms for exploratory data analysis. Next, the rule engine node can be used to convert the ten-point scale to a dichotomous variable, distinguishing good wine from the rest. The column filter node then filters out the original ten-point feature to prevent leakage.

The partitioning node splits the data into training and testing sets, followed by decision tree learner and predictor nodes. Finally, the results can be evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic node, examining the area under the curve value.

The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning to identify which physiochemical properties contribute to a wine being classified as "good". This dataset is also available from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and was originally published in the journal Decision Support Systems.
