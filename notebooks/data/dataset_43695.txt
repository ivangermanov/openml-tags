The Red Wine Quality dataset is related to the red variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physiochemical and sensory variables are available. These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.

This dataset is also available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For more information, consult the reference.

The input variables are based on physiochemical tests, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, and sulphates. The output variable is based on sensory data, which is the quality of the wine, scored between zero and ten.

One interesting approach is to set an arbitrary cutoff for the dependent variable, wine quality, at seven or higher, classifying it as "good" and the remainder as "not good". This allows for practice with hyperparameter tuning on decision tree algorithms, examining the ROC curve and the AUC value. Without feature engineering or overfitting, it is possible to achieve an AUC of point eight eight.

A great tool for this is KNIME, a graphical user interface that can be used for data analysis. The process involves reading the CSV file, performing basic exploratory data analysis, and then using a rule engine node to turn the ten-point scale into a dichotomous variable. The output is then filtered to prevent leaking, and the data is split into training and testing sets. The decision tree learner node is used to train the model, and the ROC node is used to evaluate it.

The goal is to use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine "good". This dataset is also available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
