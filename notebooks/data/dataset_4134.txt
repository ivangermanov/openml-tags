This dataset predicts a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties. Each row in this dataset represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response, where the molecule was seen to elicit this response or not. The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors, which are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule, for example its size, shape, or elemental constitution. The descriptor matrix has been normalized. The original training and test sets were merged.

Features: Molecular descriptors, including size, shape, and elemental constitution.

Keywords: Biological Response, Molecules, Chemical Properties, Molecular Descriptors, Elemental Constitution.
