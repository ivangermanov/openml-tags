This dataset is designed to predict a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties. Each row in this dataset represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response or not. The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors, which are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule, such as size, shape, or elemental constitution. The descriptor matrix has been normalized. The original training and test set were merged.

Features: molecular descriptors, including properties that describe the size, shape, and elemental constitution of the molecules.

Keywords: biological response, molecular descriptors, chemical properties, molecule characteristics, elemental constitution.
