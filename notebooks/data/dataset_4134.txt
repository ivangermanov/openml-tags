The Bank Marketing dataset belongs to the regression on numerical features benchmark. It is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, where the marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess whether the product, namely a bank term deposit, would be subscribed or not.

The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe a term deposit, which is represented by the variable y.

Attribute Information:
The input variables include bank client data, comprising age, job type, marital status, education level, default credit status, average yearly balance, housing loan status, personal loan status, and other relevant information.

Regarding the last contact of the current campaign, the input variables also include the contact communication type, last contact day of the month, last contact month of the year, and last contact duration.

Other attributes include the number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client, the number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign, the number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client, and the outcome of the previous marketing campaign.

Output Variable:
The desired target is whether the client has subscribed a term deposit or not, represented by the binary variable y.
