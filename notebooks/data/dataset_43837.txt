The New Delhi Rental Listings dataset is a comprehensive collection of data from a rental price prediction project. This dataset encompasses various types of properties, including apartments, independent floors, independent houses, villas, and more. With over twelve thousand rental listings from a prominent real estate website, this dataset provides an extensive platform for analyzing rental prices, identifying affluent neighborhoods, and understanding the dynamics of the rental market.

The dataset comprises a diverse range of features, including both quantitative and categorical variables, as well as geographic coordinates. These features provide information about the properties themselves, such as their size in square feet, type, and number of bedrooms. Additionally, the dataset includes data about the locality of each property, including its latitude and longitude, locality name, suburb name, and city name.

Furthermore, the dataset provides information about the asking rent, property agency, and proximity to key landmarks, such as the closest metro station, Indira Gandhi International Airport, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and New Delhi Railway Station. A heatmap visualization of the data reveals a concentration of high-rental properties in specific areas, with monthly rents exceeding two lakh rupees per month.
