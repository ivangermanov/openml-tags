This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The conversion process involves transforming the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. 

The dataset comprises various features including Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting Electrocardiogram Results, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise Induced Angina, Old Peak, Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment, Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy, and Thalassemia Diagnosis.
