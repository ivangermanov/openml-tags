The Kidney Dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. This conversion involves transforming the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset explores various aspects related to kidney health, including the patient, time, status, age, sex, and disease type.
