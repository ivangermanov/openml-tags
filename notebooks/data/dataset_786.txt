Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set. It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset is a modified version of the original Cleveland heart disease dataset. The primary modification involves the binarization of the target feature, transforming it from a numeric value to a binary classification. This process was achieved by calculating the mean of the original target values and subsequently categorizing instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). This alteration allows for a simplified binary classification problem, which can be useful for certain types of analysis and machine learning tasks.

The dataset includes various features related to heart health and patient characteristics. These features encompass both demographic information and medical measurements, providing a comprehensive view of factors that may contribute to heart disease risk. Some of the key features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and several other relevant medical indicators.

Researchers and data scientists utilizing this dataset should be aware of its binarized nature and cite it appropriately in their work. The transformation of the target variable allows for focused study on the presence or absence of heart disease risk, rather than a more nuanced scale of risk levels.
