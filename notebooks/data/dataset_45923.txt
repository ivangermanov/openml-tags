Indoor Scenes

Indoor scene recognition is a challenging open problem in high-level vision. Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty lies in the fact that while some indoor scenes, such as corridors, can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others, like bookstores, are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally, to address the indoor scenes recognition problem, we need a model that can exploit both local and global discriminative information.

The database contains a diverse range of indoor categories, and a total of images. The number of images varies across categories, but there are at least images per category. All images are in JPEG format. The images provided are for research purposes only.
