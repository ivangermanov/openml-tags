Breast Cancer Prediction

Tags: Context

This dataset includes data from a random sample of digital and film-screen mammograms received by women between the ages of sixty and eighty-nine years within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium between January 2005 and December 2008. Some women contribute multiple examinations to the dataset. The data is useful in teaching about data analysis, epidemiological study designs, or statistical methods for binary outcomes or correlated data.
