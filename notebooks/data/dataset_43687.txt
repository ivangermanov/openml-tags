This Breast Cancer Prediction dataset includes data from a random sample of digital and film-screen mammograms received by women aged sixty to eighty-nine years within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium between January 2005 and December 2008. Some women contribute multiple examinations to the dataset.

Data is useful in teaching about data analysis, epidemiological study designs, or statistical methods for binary outcomes or correlated data.

The dataset contains thirteen attributes, which are described as follows:

Field Name | Type | Description
-----------|------|-----------
Age at the Time of Mammography | Number | Patient's age in years at the time of mammogram.
Radiologist's Assessment | String | Radiologist's assessment based on the BI-RADS scale.
Is Binary Indicator of Cancer Diagnosis | Boolean | Binary indicator of cancer diagnosis within one year of screening mammogram (No cancer diagnosis = False, Cancer diagnosis = True).
Comparison Mammogram from Mammography | String | Comparison mammogram from prior mammography examination available.
Patient's BI-RADS Breast Density | String | Patient's BI-RADS breast density as recorded at the time of mammogram.
Family History of Breast Cancer | String | Family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative.
Current Use of Hormone Therapy | String | Current use of hormone therapy at the time of mammogram.
Binary Indicator | String | Binary indicator of whether the woman had ever received a prior mammogram.
