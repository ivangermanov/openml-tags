The QSAR-TID-105654 dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 105654. This dataset has eleven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature.

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was obtained from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen.

This dataset is related to images, machine learning, and multi-task learning QSAR.

The compound activity values are measured in pseudo-pCI fifty units.

The target is lysophosphatidic acid receptor six, which is also known as LPA-six, LPAR six, LPA receptor six, oleoyl-L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid receptor.

This receptor is a single protein, preferred name lysophosphatidic acid receptor six, and its synonyms include LPA-six, LPAR six, LPA receptor six, oleoyl-L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid receptor.

It belongs to the species group homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, small molecule receptor, lipid-like ligand receptor, EDG receptor.

It is described as being involved in various biological processes, including blastocyst hatching, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, positive regulation of Rho protein signal transduction, positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration involved in phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled signaling pathway.

It is also associated with various cellular components, including plasma membrane and membrane.
