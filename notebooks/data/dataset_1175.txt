Heart Long Beach Dataset

This dataset contains seventy-six attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of fourteen of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by machine learning researchers to this date. The goal field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is an integer-valued field ranging from zero (no presence) to four.

Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values one, two, three, and four) from absence (value zero). The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been processed, which contains the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

Attribute information: only fourteen attributes are used. These include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, old peak, slope, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and diagnosis of heart disease.

The dataset provides information about each patient, including their age, sex, chest pain location, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, whether they are a smoker, their fasting blood sugar level, whether they have a history of diabetes, family history of coronary artery disease, resting electrocardiographic results, exercise protocol, duration of exercise test, time when ST depression was noted, maximum heart rate achieved, resting heart rate, peak exercise blood pressure, exercise-induced angina, and diagnosis of heart disease.
