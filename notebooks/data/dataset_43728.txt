NBA Stats Complete with Player Stats

As an avid NBA fan, I understand the frustration of dealing with incomplete data. It's not just about missing instances in columns, but entire columns that could be crucial for research or analysis. That's why I take the initiative to scrape my own data to ensure its quality. I'm excited to share with you one of the most comprehensive NBA datasets available, featuring complete basic stats from every regular season game from the 1996-1997 season to the 2018-2019 season.

This dataset represents the culmination of my efforts, and I'm eager to see how the Kaggle community will utilize it. The data includes a wide range of features, including season, date, season half, game, team, quarter scores, total score, home or away games, wins, and various team and player statistics.

The team statistics include field goals made and attempted, three-pointers made and attempted, free throws made and attempted, rebounds, assists, turnovers, steals, blocks, personal fouls, and shooting percentages. The player statistics include minutes played, field goals made and attempted, three-pointers made and attempted, free throws made and attempted, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, personal fouls, points scored, plus/minus, and height.
