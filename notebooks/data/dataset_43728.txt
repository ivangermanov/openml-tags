Tags: Machine Learning, Mathematics

As an avid NBA fan, I understand the importance of having comprehensive and accurate data for analysis and research. Unfortunately, many datasets lack essential columns, which can hinder the quality of results. To address this issue, I have curated a meticulous dataset that includes complete basic stats from every regular season game from the 1996-1997 season to the 2018-2019 season.

This dataset is a culmination of my efforts to scrape and compile high-quality data, ensuring its integrity and completeness. Although I have utilized this dataset for my own purposes, I am excited to share it with the Kaggle community and explore the innovative ways they will utilize it.

The dataset features a wide range of variables, including:

Season, Date, Season Half, Game, Team, Quarter scores, Total score, Home or Away team indicator, Win indicator, and various team statistics such as Field Goals Made, Field Goal Attempts, Three Pointers Made, Free Throws Made, Rebounds, Assists, Turnovers, Steals, Blocks, and Fouls. Additionally, it includes player-specific statistics, including Minutes played, Field Goals Made, Field Goal Percentage, Three Pointers Made, Free Throws Made, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Turnovers, Fouls, Points scored, Plus-Minus rating, and Height.
