QSAR-TID-10026 Dataset: Images, Language, MTL QSAR, Study Three

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one hundred twenty-six, and it has six hundred twenty-one rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pseudo-pCI50.

The features represent Fingerprint Circuit Fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint circuit fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit zero, fingerprint circuit fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit one, fingerprint circuit fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit two, and so forth up to fingerprint circuit fingerprint six one hundred twenty-four bit nine hundred ninety-eight.
