QSAR-TID-10026 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: Angiotensin II type 2 receptor, and it has multiple rows and features. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four zero, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four one, FCFP six one hundred twenty-four two, and so on.

Scraped Data: ID: CHEMBL two five seven Type: SINGLE PROTEIN Preferred Name: Angiotensin II type two receptor Synonyms: Agtr two Angiotensin II type-two receptor AT two receptor Type-two angiotensin II receptor Synonyms: organism: Rattus norvegicus Species Group: No Protein Target Classification: one Membrane receptor Family A G protein-coupled receptor Peptide receptor Family A GPCR Short peptide receptor Family A GPCR Angiotensin receptor Description Relationship Accession Type-two angiotensin II receptor SINGLE PROTEIN
