QSAR-TID-10396 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 10396. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXC50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints do not require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, particularly those interested in CaM kinase II beta, a protein target involved in various cellular processes.

The protein target, CaM kinase II beta, is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit beta, also known as Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit beta, CAM2, CAMK2, CAMK2B, and CAMKB. It is a single protein target, and its synonyms include Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit beta, CAM2, CAMK2, CAMK2B, and CAMKB.

The protein target is involved in various biological processes, including protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, nervous system development, and regulation of synaptic plasticity. It is also involved in the regulation of calcium ion transport and is a key player in the development of neurons and the formation of synapses.
