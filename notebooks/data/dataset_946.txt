Name: Visualizing Ethanol

Tags: binarized, mythbusting, study

Source: Unknown - Date unknown

Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: NOx, C, binary Class

This dataset focuses on visualizing ethanol and has been binarized from its original form. The process involved converting a numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This conversion was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently classifying instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset is intended for use in mythbusting and various studies. It is important to note that the original source and date of creation are unknown. When utilizing this dataset, proper citation of the binarized version is requested. The features included in this dataset are NOx, C, and a binary classification.
