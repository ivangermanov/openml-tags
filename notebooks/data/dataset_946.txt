The Adult Census dataset is a collection of data related to chemistry, life science, and myth busting. It is a hybrid of decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers aimed at scaling up the accuracy of the classifiers.

This dataset is sourced from the Machine Learning Repository of Recommendation Systems (MLRR) and is identical to the version stored in the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository, although it only includes the training data and excludes the test data.

The Adult Census dataset features a range of attributes, including identification, age, employment classification, educational background, marital status, occupation type, family relationships, racial demographics, gender, financial gain or loss, weekly working hours, and country of origin. These attributes ultimately influence the classification outcome.
