QSAR-TID-12264 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12264. The dataset has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12264. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. The dataset has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR datasets for various drug targets. The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development, as it provides valuable information on the activity of compounds against a specific drug target.

The dataset contains information on the cGMP-dependent protein kinase one alpha, which is a single protein target. The protein is also known as cGK one, cGKI, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase one. It belongs to the species Bos taurus and is classified as an enzyme/kinase/protein kinase/AGC protein kinase group/AGC protein kinase PKG family.

The protein has various functions, including nucleotide binding, catalytic activity, protein kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity. It is involved in various biological processes, including neuron migration, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, metabolic process, and phosphorylation.
