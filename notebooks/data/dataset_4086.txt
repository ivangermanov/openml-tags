QSAR-TID-12264 Tags: MTLQSAR, Social Media, Study Three, Transportation 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12264, and it has twenty-four rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PX C Fifty.

The features represent Fixed Count Fingerprint One Hundred Twenty-Four Bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, Fixed Count Fingerprint Six One Hundred Twenty-Four Bit Zero, Fixed Count Fingerprint Six One Hundred Twenty-Four Bit One, Fixed Count Fingerprint Six One Hundred Twenty-Four Bit Two, and so forth.

This dataset contains information about a Single Protein, specifically cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase One Alpha. It also includes synonyms such as cGK One, cGK One Alpha, cGKI, and cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase One.

The organism is Bos Taurus, and the species group is classified under No Protein Target Classification, specifically under One Enzyme-Kinase-Protein Kinase-AGC Protein Kinase Group-AGC Protein Kinase PKG Family.

Description Relationship Accession shows that it is a cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase One Single Protein with accession P Zero Zero Five One Six.

The dataset includes Component information, such as cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, and plasma membrane.

It also includes Function information, such as nucleotide binding, catalytic activity, protein kinase activity, protein serine-threonine kinase activity, cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity, calcium channel regulator activity, ATP binding, kinase activity, transferase activity, and cGMP binding.

Additionally, Process information is included, such as neuron migration, protein phosphorylation, signal transduction, metabolic process, phosphorylation, dendrite development, cGMP-mediated signaling, forebrain development, regulation of GTPase activity, negative regulation of smooth muscle contraction, collateral sprouting, relaxation of vascular associated smooth muscle, negative regulation of platelet aggregation, and negative regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell proliferation.

Furthermore, it includes information from various databases, such as canSAR-Target, IntAct, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, and Pfam.
