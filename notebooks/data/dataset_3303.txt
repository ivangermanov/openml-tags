This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one zero three four five one, and it has twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features including IDs and class feature: molecule ChEMBL ID and median pXC fifty.

The features represent FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the pipeline pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features include molecule ChEMBL ID, FCFP six one zero two four bit molecular fingerprints, and many others.

Scraped data includes information about the Angiotensin type two receptor, which is a single protein preferred name, also known as Angiotensin two type-two receptor, Type-two Angiotensin two receptor, and others. It belongs to the species Sus scrofa, and its protein target classification is one point Membrane receptor slash Family A G protein-coupled receptor slash Peptide receptor family A GPCR slash Short peptide receptor family A GPCR slash Angiotensin receptor.

Description includes relationship accession type-two Angiotensin two receptor Single Protein, and many others. It has gene ontology components including plasma membrane and membrane, gene ontology functions including G protein-coupled receptor activity and Angiotensin type two receptor activity, and gene ontology processes including inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, Angiotensin-activated signaling pathway, regulation of apoptotic process, and blood vessel diameter maintenance.

It also includes UniProt information, InterPro information, and Pfam information.
