QSAR-TID-103451 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 103451. The dataset has twenty-seven rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Angiotensin Type II Receptor. The Angiotensin Type II Receptor is a single protein, also known as Angiotensin II Type-Two Receptor or Type-Two Angiotensin II Receptor. It belongs to the species Sus scrofa and is classified as a membrane receptor, specifically a family A G protein-coupled receptor, and a peptide receptor.

The Angiotensin Type II Receptor is involved in various biological processes, including inflammatory response, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, angiotensin-activated signaling pathway, regulation of apoptotic process, and blood vessel diameter maintenance. It is also associated with several gene ontology functions, including G protein-coupled receptor activity and angiotensin type II receptor activity.
