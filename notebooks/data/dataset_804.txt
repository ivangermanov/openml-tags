Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset, known as Hutsof Logis, is a binarized version of an original dataset from an unknown source. The transformation process involved converting a numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean value and subsequently classifying instances below this threshold as positive ('P') and those above as negative ('N'). The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, location, coherence, maturity, delay, prosecution status, and a binary classification. It is associated with tags related to binarization, mythbusting, and study purposes. Researchers are advised to cite this binarized version when using it in their work.
