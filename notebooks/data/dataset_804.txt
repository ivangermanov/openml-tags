Pasture Dataset

The binarized version of this dataset converts the multi-class target feature into a two-class nominal target feature. This is achieved by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative.

Originally, this dataset was characterized by various features, including fertilizer application, terrain slope, direction aspects deviating from northwest, Olsen phosphorus levels, minimum nitrogen requirements, total soil sulfur content, calcium-magnesium ratios, loss on moisture, mean nitrogen fixation rates, earthworm populations, potassium unsaturation levels, organic matter content, air permeability, porosity, hydraulic functional response group percentages, legume yields, osmotic potential percentage means, mean temperature during January to March, annual mean runoff values, root surface areas, leaf phosphorus concentrations, and binary classification labels.
