**Robot Execution Failures Data Set**

Tags: Chemistry, Life Science

**Abstract**
This data set contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

**Data Set Information**
The donation includes five data sets, each of which defines a different learning problem:

* LP1 (This Data Set): failures in approach to grasp position
* LP2: failures in transfer of a part
* LP3: position of part after a transfer failure
* LP4: failures in approach to ungrasp position
* LP5: failures in motion with part

In order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies (based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc.) was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of twenty percent in accuracy.

**Attribute Information**
All features are numeric, although they are integer-valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection; each failure instance is characterized in terms of fifteen force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection; the total observation window for each failure instance was three hundred fifteen milliseconds. Each example is described as follows:

Class Force X one, Force Y one, Force Z one, Torque X one, Torque Y one, Torque Z one,..., Force X fifteen, Force Y fifteen, Force Z fifteen, Torque X fifteen, Torque Y fifteen, Torque Z fifteen

where Force X one through Force X fifteen is the evolution of force X in the observation window, the same for Force Y, Force Z, and the torques; there is a total of ninety features.
