QSAR TID Dataset
Tags: MTLQSAR, study

Source: MetaQSAR project - September

Please cite: This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version) showing activity values (unit is pseudo pCI) of several compounds on drug target TID, and it has rows and features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID and MEDIAN PXC). The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

Features: MOLECULE CHEMBL ID, FCFP, and many more...

Protein Target Classification: Enzyme/Protease/Metallo protease/Metallo protease MC clan/Metallo protease MB subfamily

Description: Carboxypeptidase M is a single protein with accession PX. It is expressed in the extracellular region, extracellular space, plasma membrane, cell surface, and extracellular exosome. Its functions include carboxypeptidase activity, metallocarboxypeptidase activity, peptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity, zinc ion binding, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. It is involved in proteolysis, peptide metabolic processes, anatomical structure morphogenesis, and protein processing.

The protein is associated with various databases and resources including Wikipedia, canSAR Target, Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, IntAct, PharmGKB, Pharos, Reactome, UniProt, InterPro, Pfam, and PDBe. It has multiple identifiers across these databases and is involved in post translational modification and synthesis of GPI anchored proteins.
