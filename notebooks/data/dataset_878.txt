Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: oz one, oz two, oz three, oz four, oz five, oz six, oz seven, oz eight, oz nine, oz ten, binary Class

This dataset is a modified version of an original dataset, focusing on binary classification. The transformation process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and using it as a threshold to categorize instances. Those falling below the mean are labeled as positive, while those above are considered negative. This binarization technique simplifies the original numeric target into a more straightforward two-class problem, potentially making it easier to analyze and model.

The dataset includes several features, labeled as "oz" followed by a number, which likely represent different measurements or attributes related to the subject matter being studied. The final feature, "binary Class," is the result of the binarization process and serves as the target variable for classification tasks.

Researchers and data scientists interested in binary classification problems or those looking to compare the performance of various algorithms on simplified datasets may find this resource particularly useful. It's important to note that when using this dataset, proper citation and acknowledgment of the original source should be maintained.
