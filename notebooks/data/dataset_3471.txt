QSAR-TID-101079 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101079. The dataset has 125 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and has been processed to generate molecular fingerprints, which are used to predict the activity of compounds on a specific drug target.

The drug target, Discoidin Domain-Containing Receptor 2, is a single protein that belongs to the enzyme/kinase/protein kinase group and is involved in various biological processes, including ossification, endochondral bone growth, and cell adhesion. It is also known as CD167 antigen-like family member B, CD167b, DDR2, and Discoidin Domain-Containing Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2.

The dataset is useful for researchers and scientists who are interested in developing new compounds that target Discoidin Domain-Containing Receptor 2. By analyzing the QSAR data, researchers can identify the key features that are associated with activity on this drug target and use this information to design new compounds with improved activity.
