Name: Fashion MNIST Seed Four

Tags: Subsampling of the dataset Fashion MNIST with seed equal to four, arguments number of rows equals two thousand, arguments number of columns equals one hundred, arguments number of classes equals ten, and stratify equals true.

Generated with the following source code:

The function subsample takes in a seed, maximum number of rows, maximum number of columns, maximum number of classes, and a boolean for stratification. It uses a random number generator with the given seed to uniformly sample classes, columns, and rows from the dataset.

The function first samples classes, ensuring the number of classes does not exceed the maximum. It then selects the indices where one of these classes is present and updates the data and target arrays accordingly.

Next, it samples columns, ensuring the number of columns does not exceed the maximum. It updates the data array with the selected columns.

Finally, it samples rows, ensuring the number of rows does not exceed the maximum. It uses stratified sampling if required, ensuring the target array is stratified accordingly.

The function returns a dataset with the updated data, target array, categorical mask, and columns.
