European Soccer Dataset by Role 
Tags: Health, Medicine

A modified version of the European Soccer Database, this dataset provides new players' performance indicators created from the original dataset. It features over twenty five thousand matches across eleven European countries with their top championships, spanning multiple seasons.

The dataset includes twenty five role-based performance indicators for both players and teams. These attributes were sourced from the popular EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including weekly updates. The indicators were calculated by subtracting the values for home and away locations and then averaging them by match and role, taking into account the X and Y coordinates of the team lineup.

This dataset was created in an academic research context and can be used freely without any additional permissions or fees. The newly created indicators have been utilized to test the performance of various predictive models.

For further information on how the data was treated and modeled, or if you wish to use these data in a publication, presentation, or other research product, please refer to the relevant citation.
