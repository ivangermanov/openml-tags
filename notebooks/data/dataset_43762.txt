European Soccer Dataset by Role

Tags: A modified version of the European Soccer Database

This dataset is a modified version of the European Soccer Database, which contains a vast collection of data related to European soccer matches. The dataset features over twenty-five thousand matches from eleven European countries, including their lead championships, spanning multiple seasons.

The dataset includes twenty-five role-based performance indicators, which are calculated by subtracting players' and teams' attributes sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series by location (home and away) and averaging them by match and role. These indicators provide a comprehensive understanding of team and player performance.

The dataset has been created in an academic research context and can be used without additional permissions or fees. The newly created indicators have been used to test the performance of several predictive models.

The dataset features include match identification, country identification, country name, season, date of match, and outcome.
