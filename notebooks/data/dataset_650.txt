This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. In this version, the numeric target feature has been converted into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, denoted by 'Negative'. 

The dataset comprises several features, including Age, Gender, Location, Coherence, Maturity, Delay, and Prosecute, which have been transformed into a binary classification system.
