QSAR-TID Dataset Tags: MTLQSAR, study

This dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL showing activity values (in pseudo-pCI50 units) of various compounds on drug target TID. It comprises rows and features, including molecule IDs and median pXC50 values. The features represent FCFP bit Molecular Fingerprints generated from SMILES strings using Pipeline Pilot software from Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Fingerprint generation typically does not require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset focuses on Focal adhesion kinase, a single protein target also known as FADK, FAK, FAK, and Focal adhesion kinase-related nonkinase. It is found in Homo sapiens and classified as an Enzyme/Kinase/Protein Kinase/TK protein kinase group/Tyrosine protein kinase Fak family. 

Several compounds targeting Focal adhesion kinase are included, such as conteltinib, defactinib, BI, GSK, and CEP, which are small molecule inhibitors in various phases of development. The dataset provides information on their mechanisms of action, development status, and associated references.

Focal adhesion kinase is involved in numerous cellular processes and pathways, including angiogenesis, cell migration, integrin signaling, and regulation of cell adhesion. It is found in various cellular components such as stress fibers, nucleus, cytoplasm, and focal adhesions. The protein has multiple molecular functions, including protein kinase activity, ATP binding, and integrin binding.

The dataset incorporates information from various biological databases and resources, providing a comprehensive view of Focal adhesion kinase's structure, function, and interactions. This includes data from Gene Ontology, UniProt, InterPro, PDBe, and pathway databases like Reactome.
