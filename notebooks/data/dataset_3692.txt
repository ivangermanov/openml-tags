QSAR-TID-12679 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 12679. The dataset has multiple rows and features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version seventeen and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are molecular fingerprints, which are a way of representing molecular structures as a series of bits. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor, which is a protein target involved in various biological processes, including immune response, inflammation, and cell signaling. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and plays a key role in the complement system.

The dataset can be used for various applications, including QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and drug discovery. It provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug design and development.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, molecular fingerprints, C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor, immune response, inflammation, cell signaling.
