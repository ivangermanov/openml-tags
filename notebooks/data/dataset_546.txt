The sensory evaluation experiment involved two phases. In the field phase, a viticultural experiment was conducted to investigate the differences between types of trellising and methods of pruning. The design was a split-plot design in which the trellis types were assigned to the main plots using adjacent Youden squares of rows and columns. Each main plot was split into two subplots (or halfplots) and the methods of pruning assigned at random independently to the two halfplots in each main plot. The produce of each halfplot was made into a wine.

The second phase was an evaluation phase in which the produce from the halfplots was evaluated by judges who took part in multiple sittings. In the first set of sittings, the judges evaluated the wines made from the halfplots of one square; the final set of sittings were to evaluate the wines from the other square. At each sitting, each judge assessed two glasses of wine from each of the halfplots of one of the main plots.

The main plots were allocated to the judges at each sitting using a complex design involving Latin squares, balanced incomplete block designs, and latinization. This design ensured that over the course of the experiment, each judge evaluated wines from all rows and columns in a balanced manner.

The scores assigned in evaluating the wines, along with various factors indexing them, were recorded. These factors included Occasion, Judges, Interval, Sittings, Position, Squares, Rows, Columns, Halfplot, Trellis, and Method, followed by the response variable Score. The scores were ordered so that certain factors were in standard order, while the remaining factors were in randomized order.

The dataset is classified as numeric with the class index being the last feature. The features include various experimental design factors and the wine evaluation scores.
