This is a smaller version of the original dataset, containing one million rows. The dataset is sourced from the University of California Irvine and is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The Higgs Boson detection data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first twenty-one features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. These features include properties such as lepton momentum, lepton direction, missing energy magnitude, and jet properties. The last seven features are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features.

The dataset is divided into two parts, with the last five hundred thousand examples used as a test set. The class label is categorical, with one indicating signal and zero indicating background.

The dataset includes twenty-one low-level features, which are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors. These features include lepton properties, missing energy properties, and jet properties. Additionally, the dataset includes seven high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. These features include properties such as the mass of jets and the mass of particles.

The dataset is relevant to the field of high-energy physics and has been used in research on exotic particle detection using deep learning methods.
