Bioresponse Tags: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "classification on numerical features" benchmark.

Original link: OpenML
Original description: 
Predict a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties. Each row in this dataset represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response or not. The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors, these are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule - for example size, shape, or elemental constitution. The descriptor matrix has been normalized. The original training and test set were merged.

Features: Molecular descriptors, including size, shape, and elemental constitution.

Keywords: Biological Response, Molecules, Chemical Properties, Molecular Descriptors, Classification.
