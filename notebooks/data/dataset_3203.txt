The QSAR-TID-11574 dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, dated September 2015. It contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11574, with 230 rows and 1026 features. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

This dataset is categorized under Machine Learning and MTLQSAR. It consists of various features including molecule identifiers and class features. The molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The Interleukin-eight receptor A is a single protein, also known as CD181, CDw128a, CMKAR1, and C-X-C chemokine receptor type one. It belongs to the species group Homo sapiens and is classified as a membrane receptor, family A G protein-coupled receptor, peptide receptor, and chemokine receptor.

This receptor has been associated with various biological processes, including dendritic cell chemotaxis, chemotaxis, immune response, signal transduction, and cell surface receptor signaling pathways. It has also been linked to positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration, calcium-mediated signaling, neutrophil chemotaxis, and receptor internalization.
