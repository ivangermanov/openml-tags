QSAR-TID-11574 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11574. The dataset has 230 rows and 1026 features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive collection of QSAR data for various drug targets. The data is sourced from ChEMBL version 17 and contains activity values in pseudo-pCI50 units.

The features in the dataset are FCFP6 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints, which are a type of molecular descriptor used to characterize the chemical structure of compounds. These fingerprints are generated from SMILES strings and do not require missing value imputation.

The dataset is related to the Interleukin-8 receptor A, which is a protein target involved in various biological processes, including immune response, chemotaxis, and signal transduction. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is activated by interleukin-8, a chemokine that plays a key role in inflammation and immune response.

The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and virtual screening to identify potential ligands for the Interleukin-8 receptor A. The data can also be used to study the structure-activity relationships of compounds and to identify key molecular features that are associated with activity.
