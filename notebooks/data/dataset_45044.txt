Loan Default Prediction

This dataset belongs to the "regression on both numerical and categorical features" benchmark. It is a transformed version of the original dataset, which can be found on OpenML.

The dataset consists of financial transactions associated with individuals. The data has been standardized, de-trended, and anonymized. There are over two hundred thousand observations, each independent from the previous one, and nearly eight hundred features. For each observation, it was recorded whether a default was triggered. In case of a default, the loss was measured, which lies between zero and one hundred. This quantity has been normalized, considering that the notional of each transaction at inception is one hundred. For example, a loss of sixty means that only forty is reimbursed. If the loan did not default, the loss was zero.

The goal is to predict the losses for each observation in the test set. Missing feature values have been kept as is, so that competing teams can use the maximum data available, implementing a strategy to fill the gaps if desired. Note that some variables may be categorical. The competition sponsor has worked to remove time-dimensionality from the data. However, the observations are still listed in order from old to new.
