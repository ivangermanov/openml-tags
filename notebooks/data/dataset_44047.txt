Dataset used in the Tabular Data Benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the Regression on Categorical and Numerical Features benchmark.

This dataset contains houses to rent with thirteen different features. Please note that some values in the dataset can be considered outliers for further analyses. It is essential to bear in mind that the web crawler was used only to gather the data, so it is possible that errors in the original data exist.

There may be changes in the data between versions of the dataset since the web crawler was run on different days for each version. These differences may include added or deleted houses, as well as added cities.

This dataset corresponds to the second version of the original dataset. The value 'missing' in the attribute floor was replaced by zero, as stated by the data contributor, which refers to houses with just one floor.

Features: City, Area, Rooms, Bathroom, Parking Spaces, Animal, Furniture, Rent Amount, Property Tax, Fire Insurance, Total.
