The Otto Group Product Classification Challenge

Overview:

The Otto Group is one of the world's largest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in over twenty countries, including Crate and Barrel in the United States, Otto.de in Germany, and 3 Suisses in France. Every day, we sell millions of products worldwide, with thousands of new products being added to our product line. To ensure the success of our business, it is essential to analyze the performance of our products consistently. However, due to our diverse global infrastructure, many identical products are classified differently. As a result, the quality of our product analysis heavily relies on our ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insights we can generate about our product range.

Data Description:

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a single product. The dataset contains ninety-three numerical features, which represent counts of different events. Unfortunately, these features cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality reasons. Our products fall into nine main categories, each representing one of our most important product categories, such as fashion, electronics, and so forth. The products for the training and testing sets were selected randomly.

Data Fields:

* ID - an anonymous identifier unique to a product
* Target - the class of a product

Notes:

This dataset only includes the training set; the test set is not publicly available.
