The Otto Group Product Classification Challenge

Overview

The Otto Group is one of the world's biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than twenty countries, including Crate and Barrel in the United States, Otto.de in Germany, and 3 Suisses in France. We sell millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to our product line. A consistent analysis of the performance of our products is crucial. However, due to our diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently. Therefore, the quality of our product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insights we can generate about our product range.

Data Description

Each row corresponds to a single product. There are a total of ninety-three numerical features, which represent counts of different events. All features have been obfuscated and will not be defined any further. There are nine categories for all products. Each target category represents one of our most important product categories, such as fashion, electronics, and so on. The products for the training and testing sets are selected randomly.

Data Fields

* Product ID - an anonymous ID unique to a product
* Product Features - the various features of a product
* Target - the class of a product

Notes

* This is only the training set. The test set is not publicly available.
