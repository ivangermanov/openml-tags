Heart Failure Prediction - Clinical Records

Tags: Heart Failure, Clinical Records, Mortality Prediction

The Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset comprises clinical records of patients with heart failure, detailing various medical attributes that may contribute to heart failure incidents. This dataset is instrumental for researchers and healthcare professionals aiming to analyze factors leading to heart failure and mortality. The collected data spans individuals of varied ages, with measurements such as the presence of anemia, creatine phosphokinase levels, diabetes status, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelet count, serum creatine, serum sodium levels, sex, smoking status, follow-up period, and the event of death.

Attribute Description:

* Age of the patient in years
* Presence of anemia, a decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (No or Yes)
* Level of creatine phosphokinase enzyme in the blood
* If the patient has diabetes (No or Yes)
* Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction
* If the patient has hypertension (No or Yes)
* Platelet count in the blood
* Level of serum creatine in the blood
* Level of serum sodium in the blood
* Biological sex of the patient (Female or Male)
* If the patient smokes (No or Yes)
* Follow-up period in days
* If the patient deceased during the follow-up period (No or Yes)

Use Case:
This dataset can serve a vital role in machine learning projects and statistical analyses aiming to predict heart failure mortality and understand the impact of various predictors on heart failure outcomes. Researchers can use this data to develop predictive models, identify key risk factors, and propose targeted interventions for at-risk populations. Public health officials and policymakers can also leverage the insights gained to guide healthcare resource allocation and preventive strategies.
