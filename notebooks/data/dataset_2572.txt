The YouTube Personality Dataset consists of a collection of behavioral features, speech transcriptions, and personality impression scores for a set of vloggers who explicitly show themselves in front of a webcam, discussing a wide range of topics including personal issues, politics, movies, books, and more. There is no content-related restriction, and the language used in the videos is natural and diverse.

Features include measures of pitch, confidence, spectral entropy, amplitude peak, energy, voiced segments, segment length, speaking time, voice rate, number of turns, and entropy of horizontal optical flow vectors, among others. Additionally, demographic information such as gender is included, as well as scores for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness.

Keywords: YouTube, personality, vloggers, speech transcription, behavioral features, demographics.
