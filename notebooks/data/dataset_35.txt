Title: Dermatology Database

Date: January, 1998

Past Usage:
The database was previously used in research on learning differential diagnosis of Erythemato-Squamous Diseases using Voting Feature Intervals, as published in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. The aim was to determine the type of Erythemato-Squamous Disease.

Relevant Information:
This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear valued and one is nominal. The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a significant challenge in dermatology. These diseases share clinical features of erythema and scaling, with minimal differences. The diseases in this group include psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. A biopsy is typically necessary for diagnosis, but these diseases also share many histopathological features. An additional complication is that a disease may exhibit characteristics of another disease in its early stages before developing its own distinctive features.

Patients were initially evaluated clinically using 12 features. Subsequently, skin samples were taken to assess 22 histopathological features through microscopic analysis. In the dataset, the family history feature is binary, with 1 indicating the presence of these diseases in the family and 0 indicating absence. The age feature represents the patient's age. All other clinical and histopathological features were assigned a degree ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 indicates absence of the feature, 3 indicates maximum presence, and 1 and 2 represent intermediate values.
