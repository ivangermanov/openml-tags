Glass Identification Database

This dataset contains information about different types of glass, including their chemical composition and physical properties. The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation, where glass left at the scene of the crime can be used as evidence if it is correctly identified.

The dataset consists of two hundred fourteen instances, each described by ten attributes, including an identification number, refractive index, and concentrations of various elements such as sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, barium, and iron. The class attribute indicates the type of glass, which can be one of seven categories: building windows float processed, building windows non-float processed, vehicle windows float processed, vehicle windows non-float processed, containers, tableware, or headlamps.

A comparison test was conducted to evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms, including a rule-based system called BEAGLE, the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis. The results showed that the nearest-neighbor algorithm performed well compared to the rule-based system.

The attributes included in the dataset are:

* Identification number
* Refractive index
* Concentration of sodium
* Concentration of magnesium
* Concentration of aluminum
* Concentration of silicon
* Concentration of potassium
* Concentration of calcium
* Concentration of barium
* Concentration of iron
* Type of glass

Summary statistics for the attributes include minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and correlation with the class attribute.

There are no missing attribute values in the dataset.

Class distribution:

* One hundred sixty-three instances are window glass, including eighty-seven float processed and seventy-six non-float processed.
* Fifty-one instances are non-window glass, including thirteen containers, nine tableware, and twenty-nine headlamps.
