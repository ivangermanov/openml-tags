AutoUniv Dataset 

Abstract: 
The AutoUniv is an advanced data generator for classification tasks that aims to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. It can generate data in various formats such as CSV, ARFF, or C45.

Data Set Information: 
The user creates a classification model and then generates classified examples from it. To create a model, the user specifies the number of attributes and their type, whether discrete or continuous, the number of classes, the complexity of the underlying rules, and the noise level. Then, AutoUniv produces a model through a process of constrained randomized search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have multiple rules. Rare class models can be designed, and a sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. AutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples; a user-friendly statement of the classification rules in an 'if then' format; and a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate.

Attribute Information: 
Attributes may be discrete with various values or continuous. A discrete attribute can be nominal with specific values or integer with numerical values.

Relevant Papers: 
Modeling the example lifecycle in an online classification learner, and the impact of latency on online classification learning with concept drift are some of the relevant topics explored in research papers related to this dataset.
