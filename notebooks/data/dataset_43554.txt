Global School Closures for COVID-19 Tags: The number of children, youth, and adults not attending schools or universities because of the COVID-19 pandemic is soaring. Governments all around the world have closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the global pandemic. According to UNESCO monitoring, a significant number of countries have implemented nationwide closures, impacting a substantial portion of the world's student population. Several other countries have implemented localized school closures, and should these closures become nationwide, a large number of additional learners will experience education disruption. This data is compiled by UNESCO and distributed by HDX.
