Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version 1). This version converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on machine CPU performance and has been binarized for analysis purposes. It contains various features related to CPU specifications and performance metrics. The binarization process allows for a simplified classification approach, dividing the data into two distinct categories based on the mean target value.

The dataset is particularly useful for studies and research in the field of computer science and machine learning, especially for tasks involving binary classification and CPU performance prediction. It provides a foundation for mythbusting and in-depth analysis of factors influencing CPU efficiency and capabilities.

Researchers and data scientists can utilize this dataset to explore relationships between different CPU characteristics and their overall performance classification. The binarized nature of the target variable facilitates easier interpretation and application of various machine learning algorithms.
