This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. It converts the numeric target feature into a two-class nominal target feature by calculating the mean and categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative. The dataset includes features such as State, Sat Scores, Number of Takers, Income, Years of Education, Public versus Private Institutions, and Expenditure.
