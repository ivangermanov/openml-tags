Name: Adult Dataset Subsample with Seed Zero

Tags: Subsampling of the Adult Dataset with Seed Equal to Zero

This dataset is a subsample of the Adult dataset, generated with a seed of zero. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes, columns, and rows to create a smaller dataset. The original dataset had a large number of classes, columns, and rows, which were reduced to make the dataset more manageable.

The subsampling process started by selecting a subset of classes from the original dataset. This was done by uniformly sampling the classes, taking into account their frequency in the dataset. The selected classes were then used to filter the dataset, keeping only the rows where one of these classes was present.

Next, the columns of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce their number. This was done by randomly selecting a subset of columns from the original dataset. The selected columns were then used to create a new dataset with the reduced number of columns.

Finally, the rows of the dataset were uniformly sampled to reduce their number. This was done by using a stratified sampling approach, taking into account the class distribution in the dataset. The resulting dataset has a reduced number of rows, while maintaining the same class distribution as the original dataset.

The Adult dataset is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks. It contains a range of features, including demographic and employment information, as well as a class label indicating whether an individual's income exceeds fifty thousand dollars per year.

Features: age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, native country, class
