The dataset includes various features related to train operations, accidents, and their preventability. These features cover aspects such as train kilometers traveled, percentage of Mark I rolling stock, types of accidents (including signals passed at danger), and fatalities. The data is grouped by year and accident categories to facilitate analysis.

Further details about the book, including information on statistical software used for analysis, can be found on the associated website. This resource offers additional context and tools for researchers and analysts working with categorical data in transportation safety studies.

The dataset serves as a comprehensive source for examining trends in train accidents, their causes, and potential preventive measures. It allows for in-depth analysis of factors contributing to railway safety and the effectiveness of various safety initiatives over time.
