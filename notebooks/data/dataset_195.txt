This dataset consists of three types of entities: the specification of an automobile in terms of various characteristics; its assigned insurance risk rating; and its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the automobile is more risky than its price indicates. Automobiles are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with their price. Then, if they are more risky or less, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up or down the scale. Actuarians call this process symboling. A high value indicates that the automobile is risky, while a low value indicates that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all automobiles within a particular size classification, such as two-door small, station wagons, sports/specialty, and so on, and represents the average loss per car per year.

Several attributes in the database could be used as a class attribute. The original data has been modified to remove instances with unknown values, resulting in one hundred fifty-nine instances described by fourteen continuous attributes.

The dataset includes attributes such as symboling, which is an integer value representing the insurance risk rating; normalized losses, which is a continuous value representing the average loss per car per year; wheel base, length, width, and height, which are all continuous values representing the physical dimensions of the automobile; curb weight, which is a continuous value representing the weight of the automobile; engine size, bore, stroke, and compression ratio, which are all continuous values representing the specifications of the engine; horsepower and peak RPM, which are both continuous values representing the performance of the engine; and city MPG and highway MPG, which are both continuous values representing the fuel efficiency of the automobile.
