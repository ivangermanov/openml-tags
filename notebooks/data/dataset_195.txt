Auto Price Dataset

This dataset consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an automobile in terms of various characteristics; (b) its assigned insurance risk rating; and (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the automobile is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuaries call this process "symboling". A value of plus three indicates that the auto is risky, minus three that it is probably quite safe. The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two door small, station wagons, sports/specialty, etc.), and represents the average loss per car per year.

The original data from the UCI repository has instances described by attributes, including continuous, integer, and nominal variables. These attributes cover a wide range of automobile characteristics such as make, fuel type, aspiration, number of doors, body style, drive wheels, engine location, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine type, number of cylinders, engine size, fuel system, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak rpm, city mpg, highway mpg, and price.

The dataset has been modified from its original form. All instances with unknown values were removed, resulting in fewer instances. The goal variable is "price". All nominal attributes were removed, leaving only continuous variables. The features include symboling, normalized losses, wheel base, length, width, height, curb weight, engine size, bore, stroke, compression ratio, horsepower, peak rpm, city mpg, and highway mpg.

This dataset is suitable for regression tasks and has been used in various machine learning studies. It provides a comprehensive set of automobile characteristics that can be used to predict the price of a vehicle.
