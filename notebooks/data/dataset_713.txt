Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features: row number, lugs, binary class

This dataset, known as Vineyard, has been binarized from its original form to create a simplified classification problem. The process involved transforming the numeric target feature into a binary classification by calculating the mean value and assigning instances below this threshold as positive cases, while those above are labeled as negative. This conversion allows for easier analysis and application of binary classification algorithms. The dataset includes information about vineyard production, specifically focusing on lug counts across different years. Researchers and data scientists can utilize this binarized version for various studies and mythbusting exercises related to vineyard productivity and classification techniques.
