The Vineyard Dataset 

This dataset is a binarized version of the original data set. The conversion process involves taking the numeric target feature and converting it into a two-class nominal target feature. This is achieved by calculating the mean and subsequently categorizing all instances with a lower target value as Positive and all others as Negative.

Features included in this dataset are Row Number and Lugs for the years Nineteen Eighty-Nine and Nineteen Ninety, alongside Binary Class.
