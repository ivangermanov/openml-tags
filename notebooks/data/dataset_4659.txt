Christine Dataset 

This dataset is a subsampled version of the original Christine dataset, generated using a specific set of arguments and parameters. The subsampling process involved uniformly sampling classes from the original dataset, ensuring that the number of classes did not exceed a maximum limit. Additionally, the process involved uniformly sampling columns from the dataset, again ensuring that the number of columns did not exceed a maximum limit.

The subsampling process also involved stratified sampling, which means that the sampling was done in a way that maintained the same proportion of each class in the resulting dataset as in the original dataset. This was achieved by using a random number generator to select the desired number of rows from the dataset, while taking into account the class distribution.

The resulting dataset consists of a subset of features from the original Christine dataset. These features were selected randomly from the original set of features, with the goal of maintaining a representative subset of the original dataset.
