This dataset is generated after an exploratory analysis of data provided by the Carbon Disclosure Project in the CDP: Unlocking Climate Solutions competition. It contains a compilation of indicators extracted and calculated based on cities' responses to CDP disclosure for the year 2020.

Content:

The dataset focuses on Governance, Data Management, and Sustainability Targets Master Planning, which involves cities reporting whether they incorporate sustainability goals and targets into their master planning. Additionally, it explores Climate Hazards and Vulnerability Risk Assessment Actions, which includes cities reporting whether a climate change risk or vulnerability assessment has been undertaken.

The dataset also examines the number of reported hazards by organization, the weighted sum of reported hazards and probability, and adaptation challenges related to various sectors such as economic, health, education, habitat, infrastructure, social, environment, and governance.

Furthermore, it looks at adaptation actions taken by cities to reduce the risk to climate change hazards, including the presence of a published plan addressing climate change adaptation. The dataset also explores city-wide emissions, including whether cities have a city-wide emissions inventory, the primary protocol used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions, and the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions over time.

Emission reduction is another key aspect of the dataset, including whether cities have greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in place, and whether they have a climate change mitigation or energy access plan for reducing city-wide greenhouse gas emissions.

Opportunities for collaboration with businesses on sustainability projects are also explored, as well as renewable energy targets and the percentage of renewable sources in the electricity mix consumed in the city. Energy efficiency targets are also examined, along with transportation modes, including private motorized transport, walking, public transport, cycling, and other modes.

Food consumption policies and water security are also included in the dataset, including the percentage of the city's population having potable water supply services and the presence of a publicly available water resource management strategy.
