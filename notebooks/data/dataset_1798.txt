QSAR-TID-101204 Dataset 

Tags: Economics, Life Science, MTLQSAR, Study Three 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101204. It consists of seventy-five rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. 

The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. These fingerprints were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation, as all bits are generated.

Features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, followed by FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints.
