QSAR-TID-11774 Tags: MTLQSAR, study_3

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 11774. The dataset has ten rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one thousand twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset contains QSAR data from ChEMBL version seventeen, showing activity values of several compounds on drug target Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidase two. Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidase two is a single protein, also known as mAPP, Membrane-bound Aminopeptidase P, Membrane-bound APP, and Xpnpep two. It is an enzyme, a protease, a metallo protease, and a metallo protease M twenty-four B subfamily.

The dataset is part of the MetaQSAR project, which aims to provide a comprehensive resource for QSAR modeling. The project involves the collection and curation of QSAR data from various sources, including ChEMBL, and the generation of molecular fingerprints using the Pipeline Pilot program.

The dataset is useful for QSAR modeling and virtual screening of compounds against Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidase two. It can be used to develop predictive models of compound activity and to identify potential inhibitors of the enzyme.
