QSAR-TID-101505 Tags: Chemistry, Life Science, MTLQSAR, study_3 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: 101505. It has fifteen rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and class feature: Molecule ChEMBL ID and Median PXc50. The features represent FCFP six one hundred twenty-four bit molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset was taken from the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. Please cite this dataset when using it.

The features include Molecule ChEMBL ID, and many others that are not human-readable molecular fingerprints.

This dataset is about Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor five, which is a single protein. It is also known as GPR ninety-two, GPR ninety-three, G-protein Coupled Receptor ninety-two, and G-protein Coupled Receptor ninety-three. Its preferred name is Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor five. It belongs to the species group of Homo sapiens and is classified under one, Membrane Receptor, Family A G Protein-Coupled Receptor, Small Molecule Receptor, Lipid-Like Ligand Receptor.
