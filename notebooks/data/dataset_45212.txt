bnlearn Bayesian Network Repository reference: URL - 
This dataset is a discrete-verylarge Bayesian network.

The Andes Bayesian Network is a complex network consisting of nodes and arcs. It has a large number of nodes, with a total of two hundred twenty-three nodes. The network also has a significant number of arcs, with a total of three hundred thirty-eight arcs. The number of parameters in the network is one thousand one hundred fifty-seven.

The average Markov blanket size in the network is five point six one, and the average degree is three point zero three. The maximum in-degree in the network is six.

This Bayesian network is a model for on-line student modeling for coached problem solving. It is a powerful tool for understanding student behavior and providing personalized feedback.

Some of the key features of the network include goal setting, problem solving, and knowledge representation. The network is able to model complex student behaviors and provide insights into their thought processes.

Keywords: Bayesian network, student modeling, problem solving, knowledge representation, goal setting.
