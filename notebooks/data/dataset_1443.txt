The QSAR-TID-12265 dataset contains quantitative structure-activity relationship data showing activity values of several compounds on the drug target TID: 12265. This dataset has six hundred thirty-six rows and one thousand twenty-six features, including IDs and a class feature.

The features represent FCFP six molecular fingerprints, which were generated from SMILES strings using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. These molecular fingerprints do not typically require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. It shows activity values in terms of pseudo-pCI fifty of several compounds on the drug target TID: 12265.

The drug target TID: 12265 is also known as the Adenosine A one receptor. It belongs to the species group Bos taurus and is classified as a single protein. Its preferred name is Adenosine A one receptor, and its synonyms include Adenosine receptor A one and ADORA one.

This receptor is a membrane receptor and belongs to the family A G protein-coupled receptor. It is involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, response to stimulus, and response to purine-containing compound.

The dataset contains information about the receptor's cellular component, which includes plasma membrane, membrane, dendrite, synapse, and cellular anatomical entity. Its molecular function includes G protein-coupled adenosine receptor activity and G protein-coupled receptor activity.
