The proposed forecasting approach is tested by utilizing the database from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This approach employs a deep learning model based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and bidirectional gated recurrent units. The features used in this model include the year, month, day, hour, particulate matter with a diameter of two point five micrometers, dew point, temperature, and cumulative wind direction.

Keywords: forecasting, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, particulate matter, machine learning repository.
