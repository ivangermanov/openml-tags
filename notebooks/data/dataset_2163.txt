QSAR-TID-10062 Dataset 

This dataset contains QSAR data showing activity values of several compounds on drug target TID: one thousand sixty-two, and it has multiple rows and numerous features including IDs and class feature. The features represent molecular fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. 

They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.

The dataset includes multiple features including molecule ChEMBL ID, fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four zero, fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four one, fingerprint six one thousand twenty-four two, and many more.

This dataset was part of the MetaQSAR project in September two thousand fifteen. 

The drug target is Methionine Aminopeptidase, also known as Map or Metap. It belongs to the species group of Escherichia Coli K Twelve and is classified as an enzyme, protease, metallo protease, and metallo protease M Twenty-Four A subfamily.

Keywords: QSAR, drug target, Methionine Aminopeptidase, enzyme, protease, metallo protease.
