This is a binarized version of the original data set. The conversion process involved taking the numeric target feature and transforming it into a two-class nominal target feature. This was achieved by calculating the mean and then categorizing all instances with a lower target value as positive, denoted by 'Positive', and all others as negative, represented by 'Negative'. 

The features included in this dataset are: 
Occasion, Judges, Time Interval, Number of Sittings, Position, Number of Squares, Number of Rows, Number of Columns, Half Plot, Trellis System, Experimental Method, Binary Classification.
