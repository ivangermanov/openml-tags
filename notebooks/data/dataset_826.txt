Please cite: Binarized version of the original data set (see version one). It converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

This dataset focuses on sensory analysis and mythbusting studies. It has been transformed from its original format into a binarized regression problem. The conversion process involved calculating the mean of the target feature and subsequently categorizing instances as either positive or negative based on their relation to this mean value. This binary classification approach allows for a simplified analysis of the data, potentially revealing insights that may not have been apparent in the original numeric format.

The dataset encompasses various features related to sensory evaluation and experimental design, including factors such as the occasion of testing, the number of judges involved, time intervals, seating arrangements, and methodological approaches. These elements contribute to a comprehensive examination of sensory perception and its influencing factors.

Researchers utilizing this dataset are encouraged to cite the source appropriately, acknowledging both the original data collection and the binarization process that has been applied. This transformation enables a different perspective on the data, potentially uncovering new patterns or relationships within the sensory evaluation context.
