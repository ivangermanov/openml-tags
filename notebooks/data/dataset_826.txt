This dataset is a binarized version of the original dataset. The multi-class target feature has been converted to a two-class nominal target feature by relabeling the majority class as Positive and all others as Negative.

The dataset originally consisted of multiple classes, but these have been condensed into two categories for simplicity and ease of analysis. This conversion was performed to facilitate more straightforward and intuitive interpretation of the results.

Features of this dataset include various chemical and biological properties, although the specific details of these features are not readily interpretable.
